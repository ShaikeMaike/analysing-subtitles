The train gets in to Osaka at 6:00
Is that right? Keizo should have finished work by then
If he got our telegram, he should be at the station
- Here's your lunchbox, Mother
- Thank you l’m leaving now
You don't need to see us off if you're busy at school
It’s fine, I have plenty of time
- Are you sure?
- l’ll see you at the station
- l’ve put tea in your thermos, Mother
- Thank you
- Right, l’ll see you later
- See you
See you later
Bye!
Have you got the air cushion?
Didn't I give it to you?
It’s not here
- l’m sure I gave it to you
- Did you?
Good morning!
Morning
- Off to Tokyo today?
- Yes, the train's this afternoon
- I see...
- We're going to see all our children
They must be looking forward to your visit
You'll keep an eye on the house for us, won't you?
Of course. You enjoy yourselves
You're lucky you've got such fine sons and daughters
Well, we'll see how we fare
- And it's a lovely day, too
- We're very lucky
- Well, I wish you both a safe trip
- Thank you
- I still can't find that air cushion
- It must be there. Have another look
- Oh, here it is
- Found it?
Got it
Doctor Hirayama
Paediatrician
Don't make the place untidy, Isamu l’m back!
Welcome home!
Hi. Have grandpa and grandma arrived?
They'll be here very soon
Mum!
- What is it?
- Why have you moved my desk?
To make room for grandpa and grandma
You don't have to move my desk, do you?
They need the space to sleep in
Where am I supposed to study for my exams?
You can study wherever you like
But Mum... where do I do my homework?
- Where, Mum?
- Just pipe down
- You never usually want to study
- Yes, I do!
You do not!
So I don't have to do any homework, then?
- Well, that suits me just fine!
- Quiet, Minoru!
They're here
Welcome home, dear
Come on in
- Welcome
- Come in
Come in
There you go
You must be tired, Mother.
Did you sleep on the train?
Yes, very well
Come and sit here
Welcome to you both
It’s been a while since we last saw you
Many thanks for having us to stay
- It’s been ages, Mother
- It has indeed
It’s lovely to see you
- Is our sister Kyoko well?
- Very well, thank you
- She's looking after the house?
- Yes
Oh, wait, Fumiko
I brought you a little something
Just some rice crackers.
They're quite tasty
- Thank you so much
- Mother's fond of them
Shall I serve them?
Any bowl will do
- How about this?
- Perfect, perfect
Did Noriko go to the station?
No, she didn't.
I told her when they were arriving
- I wonder what happened?
- Serve these, will you?
Minoru? Isamu?
What are you up to?
Come with me
Grandpa, grandma...
You've both grown
- Minoru's at primary school now
- I see
- And how old are you, Isamu?
- How old are you?
How old?
The bath's ready for you whenever you like
- Would you like a bath, Father?
- All right...
- Would you like to change, Mother?
- l’ll get you a light kimono... l’m fine, Fumiko l’ll get in the bath l’ll take that
This way
Did Keizo meet you at Osaka?
Yes, I sent him a telegram and he met us
- Is he well?
- Yes
He sent a present for you
It’s all right, Mother, give it to me later
- Have you got a towel, Father?
- Yes, yes
Take your time
- What shall we feed them?
- I don't know...
- Hey, brother?
- What?
Meat's all right for supper, isn't it?
Sukiyaki?
Yeah, fine
And maybe some sashimi?
The meat'll be enough
There's plenty to go round
- Hello?
- Here's Noriko. Come in!
- Welcome
- I was too late!
- Did you go to Tokyo Station?
- By the time I got there, they'd gone
- For you
- Oh, thank you
- Oh, come in
- Welcome
- Sorry l’m so late
- They're upstairs
All right, l’ll go and say hello
Welcome to you both
- It’s been a while, Noriko
- It’s lovely to see you
Were you very busy?
Not really, but by the time I'd finished, it was too late
Oh, you needn't have rushed round here.
We could've met tomorrow
Still working for the same company?
- It must be hard, supporting yourself
- Not at all
- Your bath's ready, Father!
- Coming!
- l’ll do that for you, Mother
- l’m fine
Being in Tokyo is like a dream
I always thought Tokyo was so far away...
...but it was only yesterday we were in Onomichi, and now we're with you l’m glad l’m alive to see so many changes
But the two of you haven't changed at all
Of course we have, we're a couple of old folks now
Mother?
What are you two talking about?
Let's go downstairs
Mother, l’m sure you're getting taller
How could I have grown?
It’s true, you have.
And you've put on weight
When I was a child, she was so big...
...I used to feel ashamed in front of my classmates
- Once, she broke a school chair
- Don't tell lies!
That chair was already broken
- You still believe that?
- Of course!
Never mind. Let's go down
- Shall I take this through, Sister?
- Yes, do
- And this?
- Just leave it out
It’s a little cooler now
- It must be hot in Onomichi
- It is indeed
Mother, how is O-Ko?
She must've been born under an unlucky star
When she was widowed, she married again last spring...
...and took her child with her to Kurashiki
But I hear the poor woman's not very happy
Really?
What was the name of that fellow on the council staff?
Oh, Mihashi, you mean?
He passed away
- Quite some time ago, wasn't it?
- That's right
Do you remember Hattori?
In the military section?
I remember him
- He's living in Tokyo now
- Is that right?
- I intend to go round and visit him
- Where is he?
Somewhere in the Daito district.
I have his address
Right...
Have you tidied everything up?
Thanks so much
Noriko, here's your present from Keizo
Oh, thank you
Thank you
- Oh, sorry, Grandma...
- Not at all, Fumiko, not at all
You're going out tomorrow, aren't you?
It’s Sunday, so I can show them around
- Right. Shall we be off then, Noriko?
- Let's leave together
- Thank you
- Thank you
- Thank you for coming
- Thanks for dinner, Brother
- Sorry it's so late
- l’ll see you soon, Father
- Thanks
- Thanks
We'll be fine, Fumiko
- Thanks for having us so late
- Thank you for supper
Thank you for coming
You must be tired, Father
Do you want to go to bed, Mother?
Shall we retire, then?
- Night, then
- Goodnight
- Night
- Goodnight
- Goodnight
- Night l’ll bring you some water
- You must be tired
- Not really l’m glad they're all well
We're here at last
What part of Tokyo is this?
- The suburbs
- I guess so
It was a long ride from the station
I thought they'd live somewhere more central
- Than here?
- Yes
Koichi did want to move more centrally
But it's not easy
Urara Beauty Salon
How long are your mother and father staying?
Four or five days. Pass me that
- Shouldn't I call round to see them?
- Don't bother. They'll come here
I should take them to a show or something
You needn't bother worrying about them
They're delicious, these beans
What are their plans for today?
Don't eat all those beans
My brother's taking them sightseeing
So I needn't bother, then
Kiyo, come and get some food
Behave yourselves today when you're with grandpa and grandma
- You hear me?
- Yes
Sit down
- How much longer?
- They'll be ready soon
Go upstairs and ask if they're ready to go
- Are you ready?
- Ready
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Let's go, then
They're coming
What about lunch?
We'll go to a restaurant in a department store
- The children will like that
- Fine
- Isamu loves those kiddy lunches
- All right
Excuse me...
- How is he?
- No better
- Any appetite?
- He'll only take a cold drink
- Has his temperature fallen?
- His temperature is still 102
I see. I'd better see him
Thank you, l’m sorry to spoil your day
Are the hypodermics sterilised?
I must visit a patient
Really?
Father, l’m afraid
I have to visit a patient
- I see
- Sorry
- Never mind
- It could take a while
That's all right
- l’ll see you later
- Take care
- Still not ready?
- No...
- I may be late
- What about your mother and father?
Shall I take them?
You can't leave the house unoccupied.
We'll go next Sunday
Very well. See you later
- Where's dad going?
- To see a patient l’m awfully sorry
Never mind.
A busy doctor's a good doctor
He's very dedicated
Aren't we going, Mum? It’s not fair!
It can't be helped. A patient needs him
Not fair!
- You can go another time
- Not fair!
Behave yourself, Minoru!
- You lied!
- Make yourself scarce!
- Come here
- No way!
- They're so naughty
- It’s good for boys to be spirited
Now just behave yourselves
It’s not fair!
You can go another time
It’s always "another time".
We never go!
It can't be helped that dad had to go out
- As usual!
- Now don't be so difficult
- It’s not fair!
- Not fair!
- Not fair!
- What? You're being horrible
- Behave, or l’ll tell your father
- Go and tell him!
- You just remember those words!
- See if I care!
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing...
Come along, Isamu, come for a walk with granny
- Won't you come, too, Minoru?
- Minoru...
- Come on, then
- That'll be nice with granny, Isamu
Let's go
Sure you don't want to come, Minoru?
Thank you
Minoru, go with them
- Shan't!
- Suit yourself then
See you later
Here you are
Thank you
- What's up with Minoru?
- He's just so stubborn
His father was the same
Koichi always had to have his own way
It’s just a shame he had to go out when you're here
Oh, we're fine
We'll go next Sunday
Thank you
After a few days here, we're thinking of visiting Shige
There they are
What do you want to be when you grow up, Isamu?
Do you want to be a doctor like your daddy?
By the time you're a doctor,
I wonder where l’ll be?
Welcome back
Hello
- There was a call for you
- Who from?
- Enomoto phoned about that business
- That's all wrapped up
- What are your folks up to?
- They're upstairs
I bought some sweets for them from a place in Asakusa
Try one, they're delicious
These are expensive.
They don't expect such things
Tasty, eh?
Yes, but such things are wasted on them
Rice crackers would've done
But they had rice crackers yesterday
Yes, but they really like them
Will you take them out somewhere tomorrow?
Tomorrow? l’m afraid I can't
- I have to collect some accounts
- Really?
I was hoping my brother would do something with them
- How about taking them to a film?
- What's on?
- There's plenty on in the evenings
- Do that with them, then
They've seen nothing of Tokyo yet
It'd be a shame for them not to get out
I know, but who has the time to take them?
- You look busy
- Oh, you're back
- Here
- Oh, thank you
- What a job you've been asked to do!
- Not at all
- Where's father?
- Putting clothes out to dry
I see. Let's go to the bathhouse
Father? Father!
Let's go to the bathhouse
Welcome home
Let's go to the bathhouse
- And we can buy ice-cream afterwards
- Oh, thank you
Right, let's go
- We're off to the bathhouse
- All right
- See you later
- Bye
See you later
Mother, you can use my old sandals
Really? Thanks
Here
Hello? Is that Yoneyama & Co?
May I speak to Noriko Hirayama?
Thank you
Ah, Noriko? It’s me
Don't mention it
Listen, I need a favour
Can you spare any time tomorrow?
Father and mother haven't been sightseeing yet in Tokyo
I was wondering if you could take them out somewhere tomorrow
I know. I ought to take them really, but l’m too busy at the shop
I know, l’m sorry
Eh? Really?
- Thank you
- Not at all
Wait a moment, l’ll have to see
- l’m sorry it's such short notice...
- What is it?
- May I have tomorrow off?
- All right
- Thank you
- What about the aluminium contract? l’ll get it finished today
Hello? Sorry to keep you waiting l’ll call for them at 9:00 tomorrow morning
Not at all
Give my best regards to your mother and father
Till tomorrow, then
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tokyo
Let's trace the illustrious history of this great city
On your right, the Imperial Palace, formerly Chiyoda Castle
Built 500 years ago by Lord Dokan Ota...
...its tranquil setting amid green pine trees and a large moat...
...contrasts strongly with the bustle of modern Tokyo
- Koichi's house is in that direction
- I see...
- And Shige's house?
- Her house is that way, I think
- And yours?
- My house is in that direction
- It’s over that way
- I see
I hope you'll come home with me later
Who is it?
- Only me
- You're home early today
- Is Miko sleeping?
- She's just settled down
- You don't have any sake, do you?
- Sake?
- My in-laws are here
- I think I might have some
- This is all l’ve got. Is this enough?
- Fine. Thanks
Where did he have this photo taken?
In Kamakura. A friend took it
- I see
- When was that?
- The year before he was conscripted
- Really...
That's his typical look
Head on one side
He always stood like that
- What is it?
- May I borrow a flask?
Oh, right
There you go. Do you want these, too?
They're delicious
Thank you
Sorry to bother you
Noriko, please don't go to any trouble
It’s fine, it's no trouble
Thank you so much for today
Not at all.
You both must be exhausted
No, we've seen so many places, thanks to you l’m sorry you had to put up with us all day
Of course not
- You must be busy at work, though
- Not really
We're only a small company and not that busy, so I can take time off
Well, that's lucky for us
Please...
All right...
And on an empty stomach, too...
This is good stuff
Do you like a drop of sake, Father?
Oh, yes, very much so in the old days
If we ever ran out at home...
...he'd rush out for more, any time of the night
Every time we had a son...
...I'd pray he wouldn't become a drinker
Did Shoji drink?
- He did indeed
- Is that so?
Often, when he went out drinking after work...
...he'd bring friends home because they'd missed their last trains
- Really?
- So you had the sort of trouble I had
Yes... but now it's a very dear memory
How true
Poor Shoji, he lived so far away...
...I feel he's still alive somewhere
Father often tells me not to be so foolish
He must be dead. It’s been eight years since the end of the war
I know, but all the same...
He was so wilful as a boy l’m sure he gave you plenty of trouble, too
Not really...
Then he had to die. Poor Noriko
Yes?
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Thank you
It’s not much, but...
- There you are, Mother
- Thanks
- Help yourself
- Very well. Thank you so much
- They're late
- They'll be back soon
How long are they planning to stay in Tokyo?
- They said nothing to you?
- No...
Listen, Brother...
...I was thinking, are you willing to put up 3,000 yen?
- What for?
- I will if you will
2,000 yen should suffice
- No, we'll need 3,000 yen
- What for?
I was thinking we could send them to a hot springs
You and I are too busy to shepherd them around
And we can't keep asking Noriko
- What do you think?
- Not a bad idea...
I know a nice hotel in Atami, not expensive at all
- Sounds good. Let's send them there
- l’m sure they'll be pleased
Good...
I was worrying about the cost of taking them around. But 3,000 yen's fine
Of course, sending them to Atami will be much cheaper for us
Dear?
What is it?
We're making plans to send the old folks to Atami spa
That's a great idea
I wish I could show them around, but l’m just so busy
- So you agree?
- Absolutely. It’s a great idea
Let's do it, then
- We can do nothing for them here
- Yeah, you're right
Atami is a good idea
Rather than tramping around Tokyo...
...they can bathe in the hot springs and relax
- The old folks will love it, won't they?
- You're right
They are late, though
- Perhaps they're at Noriko's place
- Oh, maybe l’ve never been to a hot springs before
We've put them to additional expense
Isn't this nice, though?
Let's get up early tomorrow and take a walk along the beach
Let's do that
The scenery around here is supposed to be lovely
- That's what the maid told me
- Really?
The sea is so calm
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- The noodles have arrived
- What's the bet?
- You had that?
- That hurts me
- Not bad, not bad
- There you are
- l’ll take, l’ll take
- Ready!
- Ready?
- You discarded this?
- Yeah, I did l’m out
How do you like that, you idiot?
That makes 1632
He thrashed us!
It’s so noisy
I wonder how late it is
Evening!
What's the matter?
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
But you slept well
No, I didn't sleep a wink
You say that, but you were sound asleep
Really?
This place is for the younger generation
You're right
Hey, what about those newlyweds?
They made so much noise!
Do you think they're really honeymooners?
He was up this morning, but she was lolling in bed
He's a fool
I heard him tell her, "You're all mine!
Ears, eyes, mouth, all mine!"
A woman like her!
I wonder how Kyoko's getting on by herself
Shall we head home?
Are you feeling homesick already?
You're the one that's homesick, aren't you?
We've seen Tokyo, we've seen Atami
- Shall we go home?
- Very well, let's go home
What's the matter?
I just felt slightly dizzy. l’m fine now
You didn't sleep very well, that's why.
Let's go
How about sweeping it back?
That would suit you
You think so?
You have a lovely neckline
Keep the left side flat and put a wave in the right side
- l’ll try it next time
- It will enhance your personality
Kiyo, pass me another magazine.
And some matches
- Welcome
- We're back
What? Back so soon?
- Afternoon
- Why didn't you stay longer?
- What happened?
- Well...
Afternoon
- Who's that?
- Just some friends from the country
Kiyo, take over this for me
What happened?
You're back so soon
- How was Atami?
- Yes, we liked the hot baths
And our room had a lovely view
I know. That hotel's only just been built. Was it crowded?
Hmm... a little crowded
- And what about the food?
- Sashimi, savoury egg custard...
Their sashimi is tasty.
It’s on the coast, that's why
And they served huge omelettes, too
How come you came back?
We wanted you to relax
We thought you'd have two or three days' rest
We thought it was time we got back home
So soon?
You're not that often in Tokyo
Still, we'd better be going
Kyoko must be feeling lonely at home
She'll be fine, Mother.
She's not a baby anymore
Next time, I plan to take you to the Kabuki theatre
I don't want to put you to so much expense
I just want you to relax
Still, my colleagues are holding a meeting here tonight from 7:00
Oh? Will there be many of them?
Yes. It’s my turn to be host
We've come back at the wrong moment
I should have told you. That's why
I wanted you to stay at Atami
- The dye's ready
- All right. Excuse me
What shall we do?
I don't know
We can't go to Koichi's and bother them again
You're right.
Shall we get Noriko to put us up?
She hasn't got room for both of us.
You go there
What about you? l’ll visit the Hattori family and stay there if I can
Anyway, let's get going
Well, we've become homeless at last
- Noriko ought to be home by now
- You think so?
Perhaps it's still a bit early
If you're going to the Hattori family, you'd better start now
Yes, we'd better go
That's just like you
Isn't Tokyo vast?
Isn't it just?
If we were to get lost, we might find never each other again
Hattori - Professional Scribe
Is that how long it's been?
It must be 17 or 18 years
Really?
Still, you've sent me a card every New Year's
Don't mention it
I suppose Onomichi has changed a lot
Well, fortunately, it wasn't bombed
The area you used to live in hasn't changed at all
Is that right?
It was such a nice place
We used to enjoy the view from the Senko temple
The price of sea bream used to drop after the cherry blossom season
We haven't eaten it since we moved to Tokyo
That's so true
Listen, dear...
Hmm, later
Tell my friends l’ll be playing pin-ball round there
- See you later
- Thank you
We rent the upstairs room to him.
He likes going out at night
He's a law student, but he never does any studying
Really?
He's always gambling at pin-ball and mah-jong. I feel sorry for his father
Go on, dear...
How's about going for a drink for old times' sake? l’m sure my cooking isn't good enough for you
Forgive me for turning up out of the blue
- Remember our old police chief?
- Numata?
- He lives nearby
- Does he? How is he?
He's fine. His son's an executive in a printing company
- Well, good for him
- Shall we pay him a visit?
That would be wonderful
Fancy that?
- Drink up
- l’ve had plenty
Drink up, for old times' sake!
I haven't touched a drink in years
Remember how you drank when the Governor visited us?
You mean at the Takemura?
You got absolutely legless!
Remember that young geisha who served us?
- Umeko?
- You really took a fancy to her
So did the Governor, if you remember?
And you, as well
Ah, youth! I always disgraced myself whenever I got drunk
Not at all!
Drink is good for your health
You're lucky, your children are all well settled l’m not so sure about that
I often wish at least one of my sons were alive
Both were killed in the war
Didn't you lose one?
Yes, my second son l’ve had enough of war
It’s hard to lose one's children
However, living with them isn't always easy, either
A real dilemma
Let's drink
Let's change the subject
- And cheer up!
- Yes!
If I had an extra bedroom for you, we could drink till morning
Miss, more sake!
Come on, Miss, bring us some sake...
Anyway, l’m really glad you came
I never dreamed
I'd see you here in Tokyo
Okaya Noodles
Here's some warm sake
Pour one for me, would you?
You're so drunk
Hirayama, she looks like someone, don't you think?
- Here we go again!
- Don't you think so?
Well, like who?
- Yes, she does
- Like who?
- That geisha Umeko?
- Oh, no! She was much fatter
- She looks like my wife
- You're right
See, especially here...
Isn't it time you went home?
You've had enough
- And both of them are bad-tempered!
- You're being a nuisance
That's what my wife says, too
Hey, come here and pour for me
Have some more
No, thanks
I think you're the luckiest one of all
How come?
With good sons and daughters to be proud of
You can be proud of yours, too
No, my son's no good
He's henpecked and treats me like l’m in the way
He's nothing!
But being head of department is a good position
Head of nothing, more like!
He's only an assistant section chief
I get so depressed that I lie to people about his position
He's a failure
I don't think so
He's my only son, so I spared the rod and spoiled him
You brought your son up properly
He has a degree and everything!
All doctors have to have degrees l’m afraid we expect too much of our children
They lack spirit
And they lack ambition l’ve told my son that
He said that there are too many people in Tokyo...
...that it's hard to get ahead
What do you think?
Young people today have no backbone
Where is their spirit?
That's not how I raised him!
But Numata...
You don't agree with me?
- You're satisfied?
- Of course not, but...
You see?
Even you aren't satisfied
It makes me feel so sad
No more to drink
However, Numata, until I came up to Tokyo...
...I was under the impression that my son was doing better
But l’ve found that he's only a small neighbourhood doctor
I know how you feel l’m as dissatisfied as you are
But we can't expect too much from our children, Numata
Times have changed.
We have to face it
- That's what I think
- Is it?
- Yes
- I see. You, too
My son has really changed, but there's nothing I can do about it
After all, there are too many people in Tokyo
You think so?
I suppose I should be happy
Maybe you're right
Nowadays, some young men kill their parents without a thought
At least mine wouldn't do that
Look, it's gone midnight
So what?
It’s time you went home
You get more and more like my wife.
I like you, you know?
Do something with him, will you?
Leave him alone
Let's drink up tonight, right?
A wonderful night, eh?
Wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful night
Thank you. That's enough for me
It’s been a long day today
First we get back from Atami...
...then to Shige's house...
...then over to Ueno Park
You must be tired
Not so much
And here I am, troubling you
- l’m so sorry
- Not at all
But I really appreciate your coming. l’m so happy l’m a burden to everyone
- You've done more than enough
- Really?
Thank you so much
You must go to bed now.
You have your work tomorrow morning
You need to go to bed, too.
Let's both get some sleep
- Very well. I think I will
- Please do
What a treat, to sleep in Shoji's bed
Noriko...
- Forgive me if l’m being rude...
- What is it?
Well, it's been eight years since my son's death...
...yet you still keep his photo up there like that
I feel sorry for you
Why?
Because you're young and... l’m not that young anymore
Yes, you are
I feel we're doing you wrong l’ve often talked to Father about this
If you ever meet someone else...
...you must feel free to get remarried any time
I mean it
It pains us to think that you won't remarry
All right, if I meet the right man...
You certainly will
Why wouldn't you?
You think so?
You had more hard times than happiness after marrying him
I know we should have done something for you
Please, Mother. l’m quite happy as I am
But you should have had a better life
Not at all. I like it this way
You may be happy while you're still young...
...but as you get older, you'll find it lonely
I won't get that old, so don't worry
You're such a good person
Goodnight, then
Goodnight
Good evening!
Hello? Hello?
Mrs Kaneko?
Yes? Who is it?
Who could it be?
- Who is it?
- The police. Officer Takahashi
Oh, all right...
Sorry for calling so late. l’ve brought your friends round
They're quite drunk
Why, Father!
- l’m terribly sorry
- Goodnight
Who's he, Father?
Father, what's all this?
Father!
Hey, what's happened?
- He's brought some stranger with him
- Who is it?
- I don't know
- Stop all the noise!
What's all this, Father?
Father!
- Father! What's all this?
- Well...
Hopeless!
You've started drinking again!
Hello? Hello?
Hey, you! Hey, you!
Father? Father!
You're hopeless!
What happened?
Where's he been drinking?
Where? How should I know?
He used to drink all the time
Used to come home blind drunk, upsetting Mother
We hated it
But he stopped drinking after Kyoko was born
He was like a new man,
I thought it was great
Now he's started again
Hey, what shall we do?
I didn't expect him back here tonight, let alone with company!
- We can't leave them there like that
- It can't be helped
Let's bring Kiyo down and we'll put them upstairs
They're too drunk to make it upstairs
What shall we do?
What a mess!
You sleep upstairs. l’ll put them here
What a bother!
Why didn't he tell me he was coming back?
So late and so drunk!
I hate drunkards
And with a stranger, too
Oh, I can't bear it!
- Thank you for letting me stay
- Not at all l’m sorry the place is such a mess
Won't you be late for work?
Will you be all right?
Yes, l’ll be fine
- Mother?
- What is it?
I want you to have this
- What is it?
- Spending money for you
- What do you mean?
- It’s not much, though
You don't have to do this!
Please take it, Mother!
- I couldn't possibly
- Please, Mother!
- I couldn't...
- Please l’m the one who should be giving you something
Please accept it, Mother
Please
Must I?
Then thank you very much, my dear
Please
You must need money for yourself, but still you do this for me
I don't know what to say...
...but thank you so much
Thank you
Let's get going, Mother
Yes...
If you come up to Tokyo again,
Mother, please visit me
But I don't know whether l’ll be able to...
I know you're busy, but you should try to come to Onomichi
I'd really like to, if only it were a bit nearer
You're right. It’s so far away
Mother, you forgot these
Oh, again! l’ve got so forgetful lately
Let's go, then
Next Tokaido line departure on Platform 14
It’s packed, isn't it?
But we're in a good position to get seats here
The train should arrive in Nagoya or Gifu by morning
- When does it arrive in Onomichi?
- 01:35 tomorrow afternoon
Did you send Kyoko a telegram?
Yes, I did
Keizo will meet you at Osaka, too
Mother, I hope you have a good sleep on the train
She can sleep soundly anywhere!
Even if I don't, l’ll be home tomorrow afternoon
And Father, don't drink too much
Well, last night's reunion was an exception
Has the headache gone?
It’s fine
Let this be a warning l’m sure it was a good lesson
You've been very kind to us, all of you.
We enjoyed our trip
Thanks for looking after us when you have such busy lives
Now that we've seen you all, you needn't come down...
...even if anything should happen to either one of us
Don't talk like that, Mother
This isn't a farewell
I mean it. We live so far away
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
The 21:00 departure is now ready...
- Morning
- Morning
- Morning
- Morning. Sorry about yesterday
- I heard your parents came
- Yes. What a palaver
They weren't supposed to get off the train, but my mother became ill
- What was the trouble?
- She didn't feel well here
- Was it her heart?
- Travel sickness, I reckon
She hadn't been on a train for a long time
What a drama
I had to borrow blankets and send for the doctor twice
- And how is she now?
- She's feeling fine this morning
How old is she?
Let me see...
She's way over 60
67 or 68, maybe
Fairly old, then
Take good care of her
"Honour your parents while they are still alive"
That's right
And they say, "One cannot serve one's parents beyond the grave"
It must've been because the train was so crowded
You're probably right
- Feeling better?
- I feel fine now
I should be able to leave for home tonight
Well, let's stay here one more night and tomorrow take a less crowded train
Kyoko must be worried about us
But at least we're here in Osaka and able to see Keizo
In the past ten days we've managed to see all our children
And our grown-up grandchildren, too
Some grandparents seem to prefer their grandchildren more than their children
What do you think?
What about you?
I prefer my own children
I agree with you
But it surprises me how children change
Shige used to be a much nicer person before
She did, didn't she?
When a daughter marries, she becomes a stranger
Koichi has changed, too.
He used to be such a nice boy
Children never live up to their parents' expectations
Let's just be happy that they're better than most
They're certainly better than average
We're fortunate
I think so, too
We should consider ourselves lucky
Yes, we are very lucky
My folks had to get off the train at Osaka
Oh, really?
Mother became sick on the train
They got home on the 10th
Is she all right now?
I think so.
They wrote to say thanks
She must've been tired
The trip was too much for her
- Was she satisfied?
- Why wouldn't she be?
She got to see lots of places and went to Atami, too
I suppose so
She'll talk about Tokyo for a long time to come
Hello?
Speaking...
A telegram?
Not yet. Where from?
From Onomichi
It came today, but it's very odd
It says mother's critically ill
Eh? That's right
That's strange
I just got a letter from father
It says they got off at Osaka because mother felt sick
They arrived home in Onomichi on the 10th
That's right
Telegram!
Hold on
Thank you
- It’s from Onomichi
- Read it
"Mother critically ill - Kyoko"
Hello? Hello?
The telegram just arrived
You just got one too?
Right, l’ll come over
- See you later
- l’ll be waiting
How did it happen so suddenly?
I wonder if it's serious
Should I let Noriko know?
Yes, do that for me
Yes? Yoneyama Trading Company
Hold the line, please
Miss Hirayama, telephone!
For me?
Hello?
Oh, hello
Mother is?
Is that so?
Thank you
What can it mean?
I can understand Father falling ill
But Mother's got so much vitality
Think it's serious?
It’s not good.
They said "critically ill"
I suppose we'll have to go then
I sensed something wasn't right at the station
She said,
"If anything should happen..."
She must've had a bad feeling, somehow or other
- Anyway, we should go and see her
- I guess so, since she's critically ill
If we're going, we better hurry.
We should take the express l’ll have to make all kinds of arrangements before I leave
So will I
In the middle of this busy time, too
Come in
Hey, can you bring a bandage?
A bandage
Let's leave tonight, then
Might as well, if we have to go.
See you later
Brother?
What is it?
What about mourning clothes?
Shall we take them?
Maybe we should
All right, let's take them
Let's just hope we don't need to use them
- Right
- l’ll meet you at Tokyo Station l’ll go and meet them, Father
That's very good of you l’ll be back soon
What's the matter?
Are you too hot?
The children are coming from Tokyo to see you
Kyoko's just gone to meet them
They'll be here any moment
You'll get better
You will...
Her blood pressure's dropped, but she's still in a coma
I see
Her reactions are weak
- Thank you, anyway
- l’ll drop by again
Thank you for coming
Take care
I wonder where Keizo is.
He's so late
- Did he answer the telegram?
- No, not a word
But he lives in Osaka, the closest of all of us
Father, come with me
You as well
Listen, Father,
I don't like her condition
I see...
What do you mean?
I mean it's dangerous
The fact that she's still in a coma isn't a good sign
I see...
Did the trip to Tokyo exhaust her and bring this on?
I don't think so. She was so lively in Tokyo. Wasn't she?
- It might've caused it
- So what is it, then?
She may not live till tomorrow morning
Tomorrow morning?
It'll probably happen around dawn
I see...
She's not going to live
Mother's 68, isn't she?
So... she's not going to live
That's what I think
I see...
So this is the end?
That's all
Then Keizo won't be in time, will he?
Life's too short, isn't it?
She was so lively, too
She must've had a feeling this would happen
Perhaps
Still, l’m glad she came to Tokyo
We were able to see her alive
And we talked about many things
Noriko, did you bring any mourning clothes?
- No
- You should've brought some
Do you have any, Kyoko?
No, I don't
You'll have to borrow some, then
And get some for Noriko, too
At least mother died peacefully and without suffering at all
I wonder if that's Keizo
How is she?
So... I wasn't in time
I was afraid of that
Good day
Unfortunately,
I was out of town on business l’m sorry l’m late
- The telegram came while I was away
- Really?
How awful...
When was it?
This morning... at 3:15
I see...
If I'd taken the 8:40 train from
Kagoshima, I would've been in time
Keizo, look at her.
See how peaceful she is
Forgive my delay
Where's father?
I wonder
Father...
- Keizo has just arrived
- Has he?
It was such a beautiful dawn
It’s going to be another hot day today
What's the matter?
I can't stand that sound
Why?
As I hear it, I feel as if my mother were becoming smaller, bit by bit
I wasn't a very good son
It’s time to offer incense
I can't lose her now
"One cannot serve one's parents beyond the grave"
We used to watch fireworks from this room, didn't we, Father?
Oh, did we?
On the night of the town festival
- Remember, Keizo?
- No, I don't
You were so excited, but after sunset you fell asleep
With your head on mother's lap
I really don't remember
What were you doing in those days, Father?
I was head of the city's board of education, I believe
Were you?
A long time ago, wasn't it?
Once we all went to Omishima during the spring holidays
Oh, that I do remember
- Mother got seasick
- Yes, I remember that
She was so full of life then
How old was she then? Forty...?
Forty-two or forty-three, I think
You have to take good care of yourself now, Father...
...and enjoy a long life
Thank you
Some more?
More, sis?
It may sound heartless to say so...
...but I rather wish father had died first
If Kyoko gets married, he'll be left all alone
Maybe
We could've looked after mother in Tokyo
Kyoko, did mother still have that grey summer sash?
- Yes
- I'd like it as a memento
- Is that all right, Brother?
- Why not?
And also...
...that linen kimono she used to wear in summer?
- It’s here
- I want that, too
You know where it is?
Get it out for me
It’s all over now
Thank you all for coming so far and giving up your precious time
Thank you
She would've been pleased to know Koichi looked after her
I didn't really do anything
I remember when we went to Atami from Tokyo...
...she had a dizzy spell
- Oh?
- It didn't seem that serious
Really? Why didn't you tell us, Father?
You should've told Koichi at least
I guess I should have
But that wasn't the cause
Mother was overweight, so the illness came on suddenly
I see...
It’s just like a dream
- When are you leaving, Brother?
- I can't stay long
Me neither.
Shall we take the express tonight?
- What about you, Keizo?
- I can stay
- Let's leave tonight, then
- Right
Noriko, you'll stay with father a bit longer, won't you?
- Yes
- No, you're busy. l’ll be fine
I might as well go, then.
I have to make a report.
And there's that baseball match, too
Well, thanks for coming when you're so busy
You'll be lonely now, Father l’ll get used to it
Kyoko, pass me some more rice
Get the train tickets for us, will you, Keizo?
Yes. Rice for me, too
I hope the train's empty
Father, you mustn't drink too much l’ll be all right
So, you're all going home?
- Here's your lunch
- Thank you so much
Thanks for letting me stay
Come and see me in Tokyo in your summer holidays
- Do you have to go home today?
- Yes, I must
Really?
- Sorry I can't see you off
- That's all right
Do come and see me in the summer holidays l’m so glad you stayed
I think my brothers and sister should have stayed a bit longer
But they're very busy
They're just selfish
Demanding things and then leaving just like that
That can't be helped.
They have work to get back to
But you have yours too
- They think only of themselves
- But Kyoko...
Asking for mementos of mother right after her death!
I felt so sorry for poor mother
Even strangers would have been more considerate
But look, Kyoko,
I thought so too when I was your age
But, as children get older, they drift away from their parents
A woman has her own life, apart from her parents...
...when she becomes Shige's age
So she meant no harm, l’m sure
They have their own lives to look after
I wonder...
But I won't ever be like that
Otherwise what's the point of being part of a family?
You're right
But all children become like that eventually
You, too?
I may become like that, in spite of myself
Isn't life disappointing?
Yes, nothing but disappointment
- Well, I should get going
- Goodbye, then
Father, l’m leaving now
- Take care of yourself
- Thank you. You, too
Come and see me in the summer holidays
Goodbye, then
- Goodbye
- See you soon
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
Has Kyoko left?
Father, l’m leaving on the afternoon train
Oh? You're going home?
Thank you for everything
Please, I didn't do anything
- You've been a great help
- Not at all
My wife told me how kind you were to her...
...when she stayed at your place in Tokyo
Not at all.
I didn't have much to offer
Well, she really meant it
She told me that evening with you was her happiest time in Tokyo
- I want to thank you, too
- Not at all
She was so worried about your future
You mustn't go on like this
Don't worry about me
You should get remarried if you meet the right man
Just forget about Shoji
It pains me to see you living like this
No, it's not like that
She said she'd never met a nicer woman than you l’m sure she was overestimating me
She certainly wasn't l’m not the nice woman she thought I was
It embarrasses me that you should think of me like that
Well, it shouldn't
Really, I can be quite selfish l’m not always thinking of your late son, though you may think I am
You should just forget him
Often, there are days when I don't think of him at all
Sometimes I feel
I can't go on like this forever
Often I lay awake at night wondering what will become of me if I remain alone
Days pass and nothing happens, and I feel so alone
In my heart,
I seem to be waiting for something
- l’m just being selfish
- No, you're not
Yes, I am
But I couldn't say this to mother
That's all right
You truly are a good woman.
An honest woman
Not at all
This watch belonged to her
It’s rather old-fashioned...
...but she used it since she was your age
Please take it as a memento
- But I...
- Please take it l’m sure she'd be very happy if you used it
Please take it
Thank you
Please believe me when I say that I want you to be happy
I mean it sincerely
It’s strange...
We have children of our own...
...yet you've done the most for us, and you're not even a blood relative
Thank you
You must be feeling lonely with them all gone
It was so sudden, wasn't it?
Well, she was a headstrong woman...
...but if I'd known things would come to this...
...I'd have been kinder to her while she was alive
Living alone,
I think the days will seem very long
Absolutely
You'll feel lonely
The End
A packet of Gauloises.
One ninety.
That much?
Prices are going up.
The next day
All our wisdom is but servile... prejudice.
Our customs but constraint,... servitude and confinement.
Socially, man is born, lives... and dies in slavery.
At birth,... he is bound in linen.
At death, nailed into a coffin.
To be human is to be enchained... by our institutions.
I'm going to the market gardeners' today.
The ad is in the paper.
It's hard to imagine you among vegetables!
Why? It's hard for me... to imagine you among machines... and industrial peace.
You're being eaten, Mathilde.
My wife eaten.
I'm sure, that by eating us... they turn us into the guts and balls... of our enemies.
And when they've had enough,... it's the sack.
Like for me.
I have to go.
Make sure the kids are... dressed for school.
Don't fix spaghetti.
We're tired of it.
Try a vegetable.
Yes, love, a vegetable.
When I was little at school,...
I always lost races.
I'm looking for Marcel Certoux.
Do you know him?
I know him.
I'm Marguerite Certoux.
Is it about the job?
I saw the ad. I'm interested.
Are you experienced?
No, but I can learn. Is it hard?
No...
That's to say, yes.
You have to like it.
What's your usual job?
Workman?
Labour. Or work,... if you prefer.
I'm work. And so, for hire.
I've been unemployed for three months.
I've got two kids.
And another one adopted.
If you're labour, what does that make me?
You don't look like capital.
Then show me the books.
It's part of the contract.
Okay?
I've nothing to hide.
Why do you want to see them?
To see if... the contract is fair.
It isn't usually. It never is.
So, you're hiring me?
- I guess so.
What do I do?
You get up early. On market days... you load the truck.
You get manure.
The others don't want to anymore.
Others?
The two Zeros:
Zero one and Zero two.
The two idiots.
Idiots?
No, only a little wild.
And the manure?
Horse shit to make... things grow.
No chemicals used here!
But it's harder. It's not so... productive. And it's more work.
And horse shit is best?
The peasants keep the cow shit for them.
And since there's so many stables...
All those useless horses...
They do... one smart thing at last.
They shit.
Why did you lose your job?
The printing crisis.
Typesetter?
Yes. Staff lay-off.
And as a militant,... you were fired first.
Here you won't have much chance... to agitate, with the two Zeros.
You will be...
Zero three.
I prefer my own name:
Mathieu... Mathieu Vernier.
When do I start?
Tomorrow if you like.
Your photos?
Never take people?
Never.
Not even his kids.
Only animals.
And then he draws them.
They're more interesting.
We're the least interesting animals.
We're a mess.
And people haven't any mystery.
He only likes the Zeros.
And me too, a little.
Because you're a witch.
And the Zeros are a bit animal.
You like animals?
More or less...
You know whales are one of the few, animals with inexpressive voices?
When a dog or a cat express themselves, they bark or meow expressively.
But whales only make coded noises.
With mathematics we may soon understand them.
Do you know what some sailors found near Kamchatka? Unknown big pink island. And uncharted.
Know what they were?
Schrimps. Immense pile of schrimps!
Schrimp islands.
And do you know why?
Why we're going to eat schrimps three times a day? With dessert and with coffee?
Because whales are killed for lipstick.
And since whales eat schrimps but can't since they're all killed, we'll all die of indigestion from schrimps.
And a good thing too.
Mr. Marco Perly, who is your new history teacher.
He is replacing Mr. Genthod, who has retired.
I know you'll make him welcome.
Don't forget my father is a butcher... and my mother sings operetta very well.
Who wants to cut the blood sausage?
In rythm.
That's fine for now.
Pieces of history.
What'll we call them?
Hours? Years? Centuries?
It's the same and never stops.
It's eaten with apple sauce.
Is this sausage like time?
Darwin thought so.
But the stuffing changed from one end to the other.
Marx thought man would one day stop eating sausage.
Einstein ripped off the skin, and then it lost its form.
What's the skin made of?
Pig intestine.
Look at the whole sausage.
There are folds and bends.
I'm going to talk about how the folds of time are made.
In agricultural societies, time was thought to be cyclic.
Each season repeated the same moment.
Of course men aged.
But only because they wore out.
He was the fuel that made the seasonal machine work.
Capitalism brought the idea of the highway, the highway of time and progress.
Progress means that the winners win not only the battle. They've also been chosen as intrinsically superior beings.
Their superiority turned the cycles and seasons...
"into a corkscrew; and the winners" were the point of the corkscrew.
With their point they opened the bottles of inferior cultures.
Drinking till they had enough.
Then they smashed the bottles.
A new kind of violence.
Weapons had killed in the past, but now the verdict of history killed.
The winner's history.
With this new violence came a new fear for the winners.
Fear of the past.
Fear of inferiors in their broken bottles.
If the past caught up with the winners, it might show as little pity as they had shown.
In the last century this fear became scientific.
Time became a road with no bends.
Its lenght was a fearsome abstraction.
But abstractions take no revenge.
From then on, 19th-century thinkers preferred the fear of thought to the fear of the savages with their arrows.
And the road was marked with perfect regularity. Millions of years divided into eras, dates, days, working hours...
Clocking in clocking out like blood sausage.
Today the highway of capitalism is collapsing... for more reasons than I can tell you in this bit of sausage, this lesson.
In the acorn is the blueprint for the whole tree.
What each of you is, was in chromosomes at my conception. Excuse me, your conception.
I'm no determinist but in your first cell there was a message you're now reading.
Some things make holes in time.
You could pass a skewer throught them.
My father, remember, is a butcher.
The pierced sausage.
Time bends so the holes coincide.
Why are prophets misunderstood in their own time?
Because only half the holes are there.
They're between time.
No one understood much of Diderot, till Freud came and was called a monster. It took all that while for the holes to coincide.
The holes prophets make to see the future are the same ones historians use to look at the past.
The holes made by Rousseau today explain the 18th century.
You're looking at your watches.
We'll finish with a binary rhythm like the heart's.
Between each beat there's time.
Time is knowing the second stroke is not the first.
Time is reduced in synthesis.
The human embryo whistles through evolution.
In a total synthesis, time disappears.
I'm all in pieces, my love.
Everything'll be fine.
I've got a job.
At the market gardener's? Is it OK?
Seems so.
Fresh air, vegetables, the market.
You in the market?
Sure, why not?
And your boss?
Friendly. He's a little odd.
He talks about murdered whales and piles of schrimps.
Even better. I've found an apartment.
It goes with the job.
Fantastic! Is it big?
Enormous. Old.
In a country house.
With fields, gardens, birds.
So, we hit the jackpot.
As the idiots on the radio say.
We won't complain.
How big is it?
Big, big.
With lots of rooms.
Not enough of us to live here.
I think you'd better give me a baby.
I don't like empty spaces.
Nor an empty womb.
Nor empty breasts.
I want to be filled, to overflow...
In nine months I'll be this big...
Satigny! Don't recognize me?
Yes, I do.
We were at school together.
What are you doing here?
Having coffee...
Let me buy you a whisky.
No thanks.
Come on. Nowadays revolutionaries drink whisky.
Aren't you in the wrong place?
Trying to win money for the party?
Now what were you?
A coco-marxist?
Come on. Have a drink...
Three Chivas Regals!
I've lost a pile.
You're far from ruined.
What are you selling?
The wind.
The wind blows over the bread winners...
And I sweep up the dough.
De Vandoeuvres of the Geneva-Nassau Bank.
Papa's christmas present.
This is Madeleine. Fast and efficient temporary secretary.
Is Nassau in Bermuda?
No, Bahamas.
Do you do business here?
No. Holidays. I do business here.
And now I'm going to do good business here.
Between the surburbs and the contryside.
Where the zoning laws are changing.
We have to empty all urban centers.
And people love the country.
We'll build luxury slums there.
Hello. What are you doing?
Do you want to see the Vandoeuvres?
No. I've come to see you.
How nice!
Have you got a minute?
I have to ask you something.
O.K. It's important?
- It is.
Can you come out? I can't talk there.
In five minutes.
I'll wait in the cafe on the corner.
Make sure you don't get caught.
I'll make photocopies when nobody's there.
It's all in the file?
I think so.
The owners' name anyway.
I bet it's the usual speculation racket around re-zoning.
He has friends in politics, connections.
They'll offer land further out in exchange, threatening expulsion.
And three years later sell for four times as much.
Will you tell the owners?
Spill it all?
I don't think so.
I'll just warn them without giving details.
If they don't sell, the prices will go up and up...
And they can draw their own conclusions.
What do you do?
I work for a paper.
Are you going to write about all this?
I don't write anymore.
I'm a proofreader.
I correct other people's bullshit.
Aside from typing other people's bullshit, what do you do?
I earn as much money as quickly as I can, and then leave.
Where to?
Last time it was India.
I'm going to go back.
Alone?
I suspect you're a jet-set hippie...
Or else you're looking for God.
Already found him.
What's he like?
He's here,... in the explosion that opens the lotus on top of your head.
When you make love standing up, holding back your seed... and letting it rise transcendant... along your spine... just to here.
The energies join to make the great emptiness, thoughts without objects.
Commonly called getting horny.
Very commonly.
I'll show you someday, if you like.
I usually do it differently,
But why not?
Thoughts without objects... must be like playing roulette...
When can you do these copies?
Tonight.
You are efficient.
Your lotus, is it Zen or Tantra?
Tantra.
Do you have any cabbages?
Yes. But I'm cooking now.
Ask Mathieu, the new one.
Are they for your supper?
No. For my history lesson.
Eating alone?
You can eat with us.
O.K. Thanks.
Have you noticed when you cut a cabbage in half it looks like the lobes of the brain?
Do you teach botany or anatomy?
History.
I'll need some seeds to plant, so we can watch them grow.
We're studying time.
How much are cabbages?
2,90 a kilo.
Expensive, two kilos, this one.
That's inflation!
Everyone says that.
Beer is two francs... inflation!
Cabbages... inflation.
No one knows what it is.
Some words have lost their meaning.
Inflation. Recession.
I know what recession is.
Can you explain it clearly?
Sure, why?
My students asked me what it meant. And how it worked.
I couldn't say.
So, they had a right to be angry.
Sure. A history teacher!
Could you explain it?
Will you come in one day to explain recession?
Sometimes I invite outsiders to talk.
On two conditions.
First I have time. And I tell the truth.
You"ll have the whole hour.
And of course the truth.
That's unusual.
- Not with me. 
It's risky.
Truth at school...
It won't be the first time.
What are we waiting for?
Marcel.
As usual. Where is he?
In his darkroom or hide-out.
Still the photos?
He photographs chicken and then he draws them.
It's buzzards.
I'm hungry.
And Marguerite?
She'll be back.
She's gone to the huts.
The Italian workers.
They're Spanish.
And Italian, and Yugoslav, and Greek, and Turk.
The Turks should be hot.
She sells vegetables?
No, something else.
What then?
It cost twenty francs a go.
Not expensive. She likes it.
Marcel not so much.
We'll get yelled at.
You're kidding.
Marguerite's out?
She went out for a walk.
To the huts, I think.
Eating with us?
What are you waiting for?
You, as usual.
You're impatient.
Know what a tick is?
A bug that sucks blood.
Exactly!
We'll eat and I'll tell you about the tick.
It falls from a leaf onto a warm-blooded animal.
It sucks the blood and falls to the ground when it's full.
It lays egg and dies.
The eggs hatch.
The new tick climbs the tree and waits for a warm-blooded animal.
Like you. An animal that stinks.
It can smell?
If one doesn't come, does it fly away?
No. It can only drop.
So it waits. And do you know how long it can wait?
Without eating?
Eighteen years.
I don't believe it.
Yes. It's fantastic.
Eighteen years.
My ass. Without eating?
Without eating, idiot.
You two apes can't wait five minutes.
Eighteen years...
You've started? I'm late...
The creature which lives only one day can wait eighteen years for it.
Two completely different time scales... in the same creature!
The tick.
You and your stories!
Finished eating?
To bed!
Where were you, witch?
Walking. You know.
I don't want to talk about it.
The mystery of nature.
All nature is mystery.
It's full moon.
People are funny tonight.
Hello.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Max Satigny.
Is Mr. Certoux here?
I want to talk to you.
But I can come back later.
Come in. Sit down.
Bring a glass.
You have to talk to me?
Because of the full moon.
No. It's something else.
It's private.
It has to do with real estate.
Real estate?
My wife, my employees.
Our neighbour, Mr. Perly.
You can talk here.
You're big.
Since I was little. Big as an elephant. And I never forget.
Briefly, this is what's up. A big property speculation is going on here.
Your land is included...
The idea is to cheat people.
I've come to warn you all here.
What kind of speculation?
You'll see. For the moment refuse any offer to sell.
And see what happens.
How do you know? Who's doing it?
A company. A friend who works in the bank financing the deal told me.
Are you sure?
Do you work for a rival?
No, honestly. I saw the file.
You'll get a letter, then someone will come.
Thanks for the warning.
Why do you do this?
Just to see what happens.
It interests me.
I'll be back to see you.
Your health!
You come because you like vegetables.
Ah yes, that too.
Cabbage, braised with bacon.
Your interest is political.
It doesn't help anymore.
Politics are finished.
11 francs 40.
You made a mistake.
You forgot the whisky.
I never make mistakes.
The whisky alone is forty francs.
11 francs 40 please.
Trying to teach me my job?
Well.
There's your change.
Don't you want to sit in front?
No, I want to stay in the back.
If you never spend your money...
You know you'll always have some cash.
If you stay cool and never burn,
You'll never turn to ash.
If you lick the boots that kick you,
You'll never feel the lash.
And if you crawl along the ground, at least you'll never crash.
So, why, why, why...
What made you think you could fly?
Well, what a surprise!
Lotus flower!
I've already seen a lot of tenants.
The bank will move in soon.
They won't get anywhere.
It'll be interesting.
One thing I don't understand.
What's that?
You.
Your absurd job. Roulette, and your getting mixed up in this.
It's complicated.
It's not. Maybe it is.
You're in some movement?
No. I used to be. Before.
During the sixties.
Maybe '68 turned you off?
No. It was after.
I'm getting you out of this hole. We'll spend the night together.
We'll have a coffee?
I'll take you to the fair.
Good idea.
And roulette?
It's death.
Time standing still. Chance!
God the Father in a little ball.
The only place where he exists beard and all.
Do you win?
No, I lose.
Everyone goes to the casino to lose.
They don't know it, but it's their deepest motivation.
The desire to be a loser.
The casinos, they know it.
True hapiness is losing all.
Usually disillusion like yours comes around forty-five... when hopes haven't been fulfilled.
Men want history to go as fast as life
It doesn't work that way.
I first thought you were an activist.
As you see, I'm not. Not anymore.
Everything, Charles.
And... paid for?
What you find is yours.
Other people shouldn't leave things around.
Marie, this won't end well.
And it bothers me.
It shouldn't.
Tell yourself it's part of your pension.
You drove trains all your life.
But I loved it.
Then that's alright.
How are you doing?
O.K. But I'm a little bored.
I haven't seen anyone all day.
Didn't you go out?
I waited for you.
No. A stop over.
Full of adventure.
Beziers. July 1935.
It was terribly hot.
I was nearly killed.
Near the station was a cafe.
The Travellers' Cafe
And the owner was a marvelous woman...
With a jealous husband.
Like a tiger. You guessed it.
I play the owner?
No, she wasn't like you at all.
An imposing sort of woman.
The way we liked them then.
Nowadays, with your little bottoms in your little pants...
How nice...
She was well known. Her husband was an old fool. She got him with the cafe. That's the way.
I was lucky. I spent every other night in her bed.
Her name was Rose, of course.
What's on your mind?
I'm trying to imagine you and Rose.
Wait.
Take this knife.
You can be her husband.
He tried to kill you?
It was a brawl!
Not up in the air like that.
A real knife thrust
What should I say?
Nothing. Just try to get me around the table.
And Rose?
She was serving.
We were in the back.
You didn't call?
In those moments one has dignity.
He said nothing?
I can still hear him:
I'll kill you.
I'll thrash you bastard.
Thrash you bastard!
Thrash you bastard!
What was May '68 for you?
Cherry blossom time?
Cherry blossom time.
And what then?
Afterwards nothing changed.
You think so? I'm not sure.
Nothing changed.
Everything's worse than before.
Apart from crazes.
Whole earth, macro-something food.
Dirty children, casual sex,
Tantrism... also rubbish.
I only see one thing:
Kissinger circling the world... that's the bloody truth.
No!
It is!
You're protestant?
No. Why?
You once were.
Not at all. Never.
Your family was then.
You were influenced by it.
It's possible.
Why do you say that?
You're a pessimist, Max.
You want your acts to have effects. You're a utilitarian.
I produce nothing.
Soon you'll make love to me.
And you'll think about morality.
That's interesting.
If you hold back your semen, it's for a practical reason.
Making a baby or not.
If you hold it back, it means you're dissolving in the great emptiness.
And if you release it, you're trying to be one with the fullness of life.
You change religion into morals.
I destroy morals through religion.
Aren't you complicating a very simple thing?
You complicate things, dividing them in two.
Good and bad, useful and harmful...
You think like a court a law, always judges and lawyers.
I'm all that?
Tantrism is the erotic game of the cosmos inside the mind.
All the difference is here.
Max, you're death.
Not because of roulette but by dividing things:
Masculine and feminine, head and body, sex organs and the face.
It makes you aggressive and stiff.
I'm whole and one:
Death by fusion and dissolution in the universe.
You're hysterical.
But I like you.
I like you too.
They propose a decent system to reinforce the cooperation of workers and management and to avoid labour conflicts, to guarantee
Switzerland future.
The progressive wing of management refuses the union demand for participation, a demand without justification.
Mathilde,
I have something to tell you
I know.
To explain all the smallest bit of matter is so filled with faith that it must be considered the begining of life, to explain where this belief lays, is impossible.
All one can say is that this faith is the very essence of things and relies on nothing.
Crocodile egg.
Tell papa
I've soaked then beans.
Know paper money's origin??
No, but I'm interested.
I'm learning a lot from you.
It's the retention of feces.
I think of that when
I see Vandoeuvres.
It's funny.
Retaining feces.
It's transformed into an economic sign, into gold and notes. Gold and shit:
We hide them both. The origin of the Protestant Bank.
Unlike most of what you've told me, that seems to quite true.
It reminds me of something:
A medical friend of mine planned a thesis about Calvin's constipation, which explained everything.
Calvin was constipated?
That's what he said.
Extremely constipated.
Geneva is a retentive city, isn't it?
Yes.
Mani padme.
The password.
What does it mean?
The jewel in the lotus.
Take off your shoes please.
Must I?
- Absolutely, always.
We'll eat, but never each other.
You can take your clothes off
I will because
I eat with my fingers.
It's part of the rite.
Part of my heresy.
Transgressing all. Meat, alcohol, sex. There is whisky in the kitchen.
A form of Tantrism consisted of eating impure food off the body of a naked virgin and making group love in a cemetery.
But you're not a virgin, and cemeteries are cold this time of the year.
Too bad!
I feel my protestant upbringing coming out.
Really.
Relax. It will disappear in smoke.
Day dream and talk to me.
I'm going to eat.
Noon, summer, the street is filled with tomatoes.
The light is cut in two tomatoes halves.
Juice flows down the streets...
...with its own light, its majestic generosity.
Unfortunately we must kill it. Th knife slices the living flesh.
Red inside! A new sun!
No chemicals in our leeks.
Buy our vegetables.
Our beautiful vegetables.
Buy a beautiful lettuce.
No chemicals.
Without scales or bones.
It offers us its wild freshness, the whole of its freshness.
Are you Mr. Certoux?
No. I'm the king of shit.
But I can take you to him.
You had my letter?
Yes, we got it.
We threw it out.
So many paper do come in the mail.
It's not important now that I've come.
I will explain our project.
May I sit down?
You've no doubt noticed the city developing out here...
You want us to move out.
Not at all!
There's no question of that at present.
We'll examine the question together, calmly...
The problem that will come up here soon concerning industrial development.
What time do you wake up?
Around 7.30. Why?
You read the shitty newspaper?
At six or earlier in summer you can hear birds sing.
So many... As numerous as the headlines.
They send messages all around us.
They're easy to hear if you don't read the paper.
But man has invented a terrible silence.
Building it stone by stone.
And no longer hears the messages around him.
If he could hear them, he'd be a little encouraged.
He's not the only one to speak.
The only one who keeps the world turning.
Have you heard a nightingale?
A few times.
Lying in bed?
No. I live in town. But your children won't be able to live off nightingales.
Though they are eaten.
Yes, they are eaten.
In paté, or skewered, which is even better.
By then your chemical products will have killed them.
I'm not in chemicals.
Your brothers are. You give them money so they can destroy whales or dump mercury in the lake.
Do you eat fish from the lake?
I do indeed.
These problems are exaggerated.
The fish can adapt to changes, like us.
The fish may adapt, but not your organism.
And when your brain's filled with mercury, all shrunk up?
You accuse me of everything?
Yes.
You murder whales, and destroy the ozone.
You grow pigs with extra chops and run highways through beet fields, and make penicillin calves and blind hens.
I think you're changing the subject.
Did you know whales love music?
No. But I like music a lot.
So what?
Nobody murders you for it.
I'm going to eat him.
What's that?
It seems he wants to eat you.
Let's get back to business.
I'll explain our little problem.
There's no problem.
We'll have some music since you like it.
Go on, baboon.
I'll eat him afterwards.
When he's stopped playing you can go.
Crises don't just happen.
They are linked to the structure and function of capitalism.
They can be provoked.
Like the fake oil crisis.
"Or they can be organised" and staged.
Like the governments of capitalist countries are now doing to purge the system, eliminate the weak and concentrate more power among the strong.
Recession and the unemployment it brings has both advantages and drawbacks.
The advantages are obvious for the system:
Unemployment keeps workers in a state of fear, of insecurity, and consequently they make no demands and the right is permitted to attack social legislation, as is happening in our country now.
But there is a paradox here:
Since profit comes essentially from surplus value, which is produced by men working, it's necessary to maintain a balance, a sufficient rate of unemployment, to control a crisis so profitable to the monopolies.
But a crisis may end like the last one, with 60 million dead.
I myself hope you're all in one piece in 2000.
4 Francs 30.
Wrong again.
This time you forgot the wine.
No. Don't be such a pain in the neck.
I beg your pardon.
I was waiting for you.
I wanted to talk to you after what you'd done for me.
I do it for others too.
Usually old people who have only their pensions.
Prices are so high they'd starve.
That's why they line up at your register?
I suppose so.
But I'm no pensioner.
You just looked funny at the cash register with your whisky.
I'll buy you a drink.
I haven't time. I live far away.
On the other side of the border.
No permit to live here?
I have to sleep in France.
Do you have a car?
- I take the bus. 
I'll drive you there.
I'm going to a friend's who lives near me.
I'll take you there if he doesn't mind.
He doesn't mind.
What's your name?
- Marie.
Marco. I've my car here.
Let me help you.
I'm coming.
You're with a friend?
A dark young man.
Marco... Charles.
He brought me in a car.
Got everything?
I think so.
And paid for it?
Yes. Nearly, that is.
Not everything...
You mustn't!
I tell you all the time.
She does it for you?
It's usually for old ones like me.
She'll get caught.
She'll go to jail.
Do you work in groceries?
No, I'm a teacher.
Have you known Marie for long?
For about... a year or so.
A year? And you never introduced me to your boy friend?
He didn't have a car.
He lives far away.
Well, I'll fix dinner.
You could have told me.
I tell you everything.
She lives across from me and I didn't know she had a boy friend.
That's women for you.
She did tell you about me?
Foorplate Charlie!
Certainly.
Nevertheless!
Did you drive that one?
It's beautiful!
However.
I began with her.
Later, I drove her twin.
And her cousin.
She's one of the last steam engines.
A beauty, and powerful!
With overheating and double expansion.
It developed an enormous strength.
I was on the eastern railway.
In winter it wasn't very warm.
And you drove trains in the war?
In the occupied zone.
I worked for the germans.
We arranged quite a few accidents.
Now French and German towns adopt one another.
People forget.
And you?
Have you forgotten?
I don't forget anything. I can still hear the screech of the points.
Everything.
Do railroads interest you?
What you say does.
I'm a history teacher.
I'll tell you something:
Travelling in a train and driving a train are two different things.
Because of the rails.
Do you ever ride a train?
What do you see?
The landscape passing, like at the movies.
I don't go to the movies anymore.
But, on the footplate, the landscape doesn't pass by.
You go into it. And into it.
And into it.
It's like music.
You go straight ahead, right to where the rails join.
And however far you go... They never join.
Max? It's Madeleine.
How are you?
Not too bad.
What are you doing?
I'm eating bread and jam and reading the papers. It's Sunday.
And Perly and Certoux?
That's going O.K.
It's caused bedlam at the bank.
Real trouble.
And they don't suspect?
No. Not a thing.
It makes me think about you.
You've done a good job.
I'm making two calls at once.
The first is about the bank.
The second is about sex.
It's Sunday. I'm alone.
I want to make a silent explosion in your head that will open a superb lotus.
I want to caress your vagina while you caress my balls.
Max, are you there?
Yes. I'm trying to understand.
Aren't you getting things a little mixed?
In fact I wanted to see Certoux and find out what's happening.
I have to go there.
I have to go there. We could explode a lotus later, then.
You didn't fasten your safety belt.
You neither. And you're smoking.
Is it forbidden?
No. But it will be next year.
And the year after?
You won't be allowed to listen to the radio in the car.
And after that?
No more talking in the car.
And after that?
No more dreaming.
And then there will be war, or rather fascism.
What's your name?
Come on, Max!
We're going to draw you.
You're big!
Like an elephant.
I was always big.
We want to draw you.
You fly away.
Don't be so tense!
We've come for vegetables.
This is Marie... Mathieu.
They've pinned you to the wall.
This is Marie.
She's Madeleine, Lotus flower.
I've got a cramp.
Unfortunately!
But it was perfect.
Stay there!
I'm crucified.
Am I an elephant, a butterfly or a prophet?
You're a bear, a bear marks off his territory, in the Canadian forest, by scratching on tree trunks.
The bigger the bear, the higher the mark.
Thus the big bear announces to little bears that he is bigger than them and that they should watch out.
My territory is as far as I can see.
No more.
My country exists only on the map.
I'm never at home.
We're all borderline cases!
Of course, my little bear.
No one can refuse changes.
Cities today aren't like in the
Middle Ages. You agree?
The overcrowding can't go on.
The population increases.
We must find new jobs.
Economic progress can't stop.
In the end everything must give way to it. Our goal, our duty is to foresee these changes, foresee them, well in advance.
Your place?
Not today.
Here are the rules:
This is Marie.
She works in a supermarket.
I'm supposed to give a history test today. And give you grades.
But since neither you nor I want to do that, I suggest we do this:
One at a time, but in any order, you ask Marie questions.
I'll grade you on the quality of your questions.
One more thing: Marie has to sleep every night in France, although she works in Switzerland.
That's tough. You sleep there too?
Can I ask one thing before starting?
Are you in love with Marie?
That has nothing to do with it.
I know, but answer anyway.
Yes, I'm in love with Marie.
Now to test your knowledge of history by your questions to a supermarket worker who works in Switzerland and sleeps in France.
Who wants to begin?
How long does it take you to get to work?
About one hour on the bus, less in a car.
Do you hitch-hike?
Sometimes, but I don't like it.
Why?
Does it count as a question if I ask why?
"Explain your "why"."
Is it because of the men who drive the cars?
You don't want to save time at the risk of getting interfered with?
That's it.
And it always happens.
I'd like to go on.
This is important.
I'm linking economic history - sleeping in one country and working in another- with the history of sexuality.
The behaviour of the men who give
Marie a lift. In economic terms, that's to say who might allow her to sleep later in return for being allowed to feel her up, or better...
To slide it in!
Very clever! You have no respect.
Give him a zero.
Already have. Write a few pages developing your idea.
Marie, how much do you earn?
I mean, living in France, with a Swiss salary, do you feel that you live better than if you worked in France?
Perhaps. I don't know.
Anyway I don't live well.
Anyway I'm from Annecy.
I'd rather live there.
I don't like my job.
I've never before declared my love in public.
It was funny. And nice.
Now you'll make me break the law.
Which law?
About sleeping in France.
I'm going to sleep on the wrong side.
Does the wind feel the clouds?
Does the bicyle know it move?
Does water feel anything?
And if it's made to boil?
"Where does the word "sun" come from?"
"Does it know it's called
"the sun"?"
When we move, does the moon move too?
And if we stop or change direction?
I'm dead tired. And fed up.
Aren't you?
I'm fed up too.
And I've got my period.
I don't have them anymore.
Will you please follow me, Miss?
Where to?
To my office.
I'm asking the questions.
Get lost.
Don't make things worse for yourself.
Fourteen.
Now. Fifteen.
Does 3 go into it?
Now 18, Cecile.
In between.
Does 2 go into it?
Is it even?
Does 3 go into it?
What's happening?
I'm growing flower.
It's the perfect place.
But they should be at school.
They are.
What is all this?
Teaching in a greenhouse?
Yes. They like it.
How long as it been going on?
Two days.
And your work?
I fixed it with the two Zeros.
In some cases the kids will help.
Why not?
If they don't go to school, we'll be in trouble. It's the law.
You're crazy. The police will come.
By law they have to be taught, not necessarily at school.
I'm working at it. Every night.
I'm serious. Everything will be O.K.
The toughest inspector would be satisfied.
You have to put an end to this act.
All this has to stop! It's impossible.
Wait and see, before you decide.
We have enough problems.
And now kids who don't go to school.
What's wrong today?
No one wants to talk?
You're all asleep?
Connect what I've just told you with your own experiences,
Your own desires.
That should help you find an answer.
What if we don't want to?
What if our desires are secret?
Tell us your desires first.
Why should we talk about our desires and not you?
You're changing the subject.
If I asked you, right now, what you desire, would you answer?
It's that you wake up!
That's not true!
Your secret desire. Right now!
We won't be shocked.
What are you thinking about?
Marie?
I can't think of anything with so much noise.
Quiet! Let him think.
He's thinking.
About Marie?
Yes, if you like that.
About Marie...
And perhaps about someone else...
Who else?
My dream is to go to bed with two girls. Satisfied?
I've been fired.
Doesn't surprise me.
What'll you do now?
I think I've found a new job.
An old people's home.
Doing what?
They're labelled. Senior citizens.
Just throw them out.
I want to help them do things, say things, sing.
Senior citizens...
Third rate citizens.
That's your third world!
The onion's a great vegetable.
Democratic, it grows everywhere.
Its skin is thick, protecting it from the cold.
It's considered vulgar.
It gives flavour to everything.
It lasts. You can eat it raw or cooked.
It's sweet and a little bitter too.
It kills germs and it's cheap.
I like cabbage best.
So vegetables are politics now.
Eat vegetables!
You're going to an old people's home to become a king of vegetable.
The pie would be better if we had a wood stove.
The past again! Wood stoves. Old people.
Next time you'll arrive in a coach.
You're wrong to think the revolution' s for the future.
The revolution is the past revenge.
You see the dawn.
I see an old tree.
You go backwards, Marco.
Because it's a time of disillusion you go back.
Everybody looks for an escape:
The body, nature, sex, onions, lotus flowers.
Small consolations in an intolerable world which is said to be unchangeable.
You don't allow little pleasures?
Little pleasures.
Everything's little
Little gimmicks.
Little tricks.
Teaching kids you could change the future.
If you hadn't been fired.
I could undermine the present.
That's not the same.
Right, subvert the present to build the future.
We have to sacrifice for the future.
Shit! It's the old trick of revolutions.
It's what capitalism has always preached.
You're living in the past.
You want a new 1905, or 1917 or 1968.
What can you bring these old men?
Nothing.
You'd rather I teach dates?
I just want you to teach capitalism can collapse.
I did. And they fired me for it.
You make me sick with all your talking.
It's so simple. We work to earn a living.
With our work, they make a profit.
And with the strength left over, some of us try to fight the system.
It's simple. That's how it is.
With old men I can act crazy.
I can do anything.
I hope I never get old.
Then kill yourself.
I'm already old.
That's why I see it clearly.
The old understand the value of time.
When you have a lot, time is both future and past.
All memories are in the present.
And all hopes too.
But they don't destroy the present.
That's why I like old people.
In ten years you'll be tired of them.
And you of roulette.
I'm no hero. I've given up, but not completely. You'll have to admit that some
- and I'm hardly one of them - were right to have priorities.
You'll have waited so long, you'll be dangerous.
I hope so.
That's to say, dangerous for your little comrades...
I have something to announce.
You're pregnant.
I guessed.
She's a witch, remember.
She reads stars and cobwebs.
You can't see it yet.
Only three months.
I guessed it from your face.
What do you mean?
Are there marks?
No. There aren't any marks.
You can just tell.
How am I?
I see it too. In your eyes.
You're big. Big Mathilde.
Enormous Mathilde!
Superb Mathilde. He's already coming out of your eyes.
It's a boy.
Or a girl.
No. A boy.
Poor thing!
I bet on a girl.
I bet on a boy. I'm sure.
Can you know?
There's a technique.
Explain it.
That's not easy.
Is it a position?
Standing on your head with your toes like a lotus.
Is it special?
No. Not special.
I know, Missionary position.
Simple!
It'll be a simple minded boy.
A missionary.
I don't believe it. I bet it's a girl. Her name'll be Marie.
Marie? Why?
Because of Marie who's in prison.
Her name will be Marie.
Marie. That's a little too much Jesus-Mary.
Three months already.
Born in autumn. Libra.
A girl, ladies and gentlemen.
A rose.
Rose-Marie, for Marco.
Or Rosemonde. The world's rose.
Her first husband will be the moon.
Mathilde, what name do you want?
Me, I'll know later.
I want Leon.
But that's awful.
Why Leon?
Because of Leon.
There aren't so many.
I want Emile.
Why? Because of Jean-Jacques?
Emile, Léon.
You're completely mad.
What do you think Madeleine?
No idea.
Unless Siva or Satki.
Who are they?
One and the other.
Him and her. Siva or Sakti.
Sakti or Siva. Or the two together.
People are both male and female, with a dominant side.
Why want a boy?
To leave the business to.
The empty body of love.
The abolition of duality.
Back to one.
Conceived in one moment:
The affirmation of time and its negation.
The union of existence and emptiness. Two in one:
Lotus and thunder, vulva and phallus, the left hand...
Management and labour, exploiters and exploited. It's all the same.
Nothing exists.
He's so stupid I could cry.
Marcel's been quiet.
Mathilde is right. It'll be a boy.
His name will be Jonah.
Mathilde is like a whale.
Your nature of course.
I'm complimenting you.
Whales are fine.
Jonah will come out of your womb.
He fell out of the boat, the ship of fools we're on.
He fell in the water and you swallowed him because you're good.
You saved his life and now you're going to disgorge him.
It's him.
It's Jonah.
Jonah. I like it.
In the year 2000,
Jonah will be 25.
At 25, the century will disgorge him.
Or vomit him up.
The whale of history will disgorge Jonah, who will be 25 in the year 2000.
That's the time left to us to help him get out of the mess.
One year later.
Did you pay for it all?
Here's the receipt.
Did you find a job?
You shouldn't talk about what happened.
How are you going to live?
I'll go and stay with Marco.
You can't. It's on the other side.
They'll arrest you again.
It's breaking of parole.
I'll just hide.
I don't want to move around much.
Still, you have to do something.
Why? Do what?
Cash registers, assembly lines,
It's just like being inside.
I want to play.
We haven't played for months.
I couldn't.
I felt we were crazy.
So we are...
No. Not trains.
Prison.
Prison?
Yes, prison.
You're in a cell. What do I do?
You're someone I think about.
Who's that?
You decide.
You have to be a woman.
Why a woman?
I only saw women for 6 months.
You saw the priest, didn't you?
That gives me an idea.
They don't knock. They come in like a doctor in a hospital.
My child, I shall tell you the parable of the wine grower and the peasant.
That's not it at all. The priest wasn't gaga. He was young.
When I saw him I imagined him making love.
You rot inside, just rot!
If I can't be a woman or the priest, who can I be?
There wasn't anyone else.
The door of your cell.
A warden spies on you.
She's out!
Open! Open!
Shut up you slut!
You can't imagine what's it's like being inside.
I have to type all the chemical additives?
Yes. It's frightening.
We have to hurry to get the paper out on time.
But there are 27 chemicals here.
I know.
But it's like Chinese all 27 go on the same lettuce?
Why did you want to go to bed with two girls?
I don't know.
Everyone dreams like that once.
That's a dream.
Tonight it's not a dream.
Will she be in there long?
She's washing her hair.
Why was she in jail?
She stole something.
Is she really pretty?
Since you let me choose,
I wouldn't have brought you a loser.
And it's just this once.
You promised.
I know. O.K. I would have liked to see her before.
Nights must be long in jail.
No. They're short.
It's the evenings that are long.
Some girls only talk about sex.
They get exited and masturbate.
Some become lesbians.
Anyway when they're inside.
Like her?
At first I couldn't take it.
Afterwards, it's different from what you imagine.
Funny how someone changes when you touch their sex.
But if you take your hand away and it changes again.
But if you love someone it's different.
It's the same before and after.
She's taking her time.
She'll be out soon.
Now you're going to hear the singing of the whales.
The first one who talk will be hanged.
Will this take long?
Long enough.
Hurry up.
I've got a lot to do.
Not right now.
Nothing better anyway.
There's the carrots.
The carrots can take care of themselves.
You think so?
What are you doing?
I'm fed up
Stay they have to finish.
They'll finish without me.
Go back to your place.
Go back. The others have done it.
Your game make me sick.
Just 5 minutes. It's important.
What's so important?
You're fucking stupid.
What do you say?
I don't have to pay you to draw on walls. I don't give a damn.
For a year you've done nothing.
I work with the kids.
I didn't hire you for that.
I hired you to get the shit.
Your school is too expensive.
We can't afford your wages.
They're your kids.
They can go to school.
School kills them.
You went to school. And I did.
And Marcel. We're no worse for it.
It can't go on. I pay taxes for schools and then I pay you too.
Do you want to see the books?
Come and see them.
We can't grow vegetables and support your school too.
Fuck the books. Are carrots more to you than your kids?
The kids will manage.
You just make them and they manage.
So do pigs. Are you pigs?
Pigs or not, tomorrow they go to school.
Not yours. The other school.
And you get back to work. I'm not paying you for not working.
Out of the question.
I've decided.
Not for me. I'll do something else.
Suit yourself. Tell me tomorrow.
I'm telling you now. Send them to the slaughterhouse.
I'm keeping my pad, comrade-proprietor.
For Jonah.
Keep it if you want. For Jonah.
And fuck you.
A month later.
How many workers?
About a hundred. Or more.
Is it lousy?
Yes. It's shitty.
You should try the printer's.
I don't want to print anything.
You'll die of cold on your bike.
Yes.
Oh Marguerite the witch,
Oh Marco the philosopher,
Oh Marie the thief,
Oh Marcel the hermit,
Oh Mathilde my love,
Oh Max the former prophet,
Oh Madeleine the mad...
I'll try to keep your hopes together so they don't disappear.
I'm going back to work.
I'll be exploited.
I'll try to use your hopes as levers.
I'm cold.
I'm in the 20th century, Jonah.
I'm only asked to keep quiet, to accept everything.
I'm only permitted to do what I'm paid to do.
I'm labour.
Labour on its bicycle.
Mother fucking red light.
It's cold early in the morning.
I'm thinking of my warm bed.
Jonah, the game isn't up.
Look at our lives! From the day we learn to walk, the day the army fires on thousand of us.
From your first reading lesson to the last democratic decision:
To yield nothing despite all threats.
Will it be better for you?
The better is systematically put aside.
I say: nobody is to decide for us anymore.
The first time nothing may happen.
The tenth time there'll be a comittee.
The hundredth time a strike, and another reading lesson for you, Jonah.
As often as I ride to work...
More.
As many times as the days of my life.
A pack of gauloise!
2 francs 30, please.
Yesterday it was 2 francs 10.
Prices go up. It's inflation.
One day in 1980
Needs change according to men's situations.
There is a great difference between natural man in nature and natural man in society.
Emile is no savage to send to the wilderness.
He is a savage made to live in cities.
For more than a year, ominous rumors had been privately circulating...
among high-level Western leaders...
that the Soviet Union had been at work on what was darkly hinted to be...
the ultimate weapon:
A doomsday device.
Intelligence sources traced the site of the top-secret Russian project...
to the perpetually fog-shrouded wasteland...
below the Arctic peaks of the Zhokhov Islands.
What they were building or why it was located in a remote, desolate place...
no one could say.
General Ripper, sir.
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?
I do, sir. Why do you ask?
Why do you think?
I don't know, sir. We spoke just a few moments ago, didn't we?
You don't think I'd ask unless it was pretty damned important, do you?
No, I don't.
Let's see if we can stay on the ball.
Has the Wing confirmed holding at their fail-safe points?
Yes, sir. The confirmations have just come in.
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.
The base is being put on condition red.
I want this flashed to all sections immediately.
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.
This is not an exercise.
Not an exercise?
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're a good officer and have a right to know.
It looks like we're in a shooting war.
- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna follow orders and seal this base tight.
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...
R for Robert, to the Wing.
- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.
Plan R for Robert.
Last and possibly most important...
I want all privately owned radios to be immediately impounded.
They might be used to issue instructions to saboteurs.
As I previously arranged, Air Police will have lists of all owners.
I want every one collected without exception.
After you've done that, report back to me.
In order to guard against surprise nuclear attack...
America's Strategic Air Command maintains...
a large force of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day.
Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...
equal to 16 times the total explosive force of all the bombs...
and shells used by all the armies in World War II.
Based in America, the Airborne Alert Force...
is deployed from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean.
But they have one geographical factor in common.
They are all two hours from their targets inside Russia.
Major Kong, I know you'll think this is crazy... but I just got a message from base over the C.R.M. 114.
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?
Yes, sir, I have.
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...
horsin'around on the airplane?
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.
I've been to one world fair, a picnic...
and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I heard over earphones.
You sure you got today's code?
Yes, sir.
There's gotta be something wrong.
Wait a second, I'm coming back.
Maybe you'd better get a confirmation from base.
Yes, sir.
Major Kong, is it possible this is some kind of loyalty test?
You know, give the go code and then recall to see who would actually go?
Ain't nobody ever got the go code yet.
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R... unless them Ruskies had already clobbered Washington... and a lot of other towns with a sneak attack.
Yes, sir.
Major Kong, message from base confirmed.
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe with the Ruskies.
Boys, I ain't much of a hand at making speeches.
But I got a fair idea that something doggone important... is going on back there.
I've got a fair idea of the kind of personal emotions...
that some of you fellows may be thinking.
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be human beings...
if you didn't have pretty strong personal feelings about nuclear combat.
I want you to remember one thing.
The folks back home are counting on you.
And by golly, we ain't about to let them down.
Tell you something else.
If this thing turns out to be half as important as I figure it might be...
I'd say you're all in line for some important promotions... and personal citations when this thing's over with.
That goes for every last one of you... regardless of your race, color or your creed.
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.
Buck, should I get it?
Yeah, you'll have to.
Hello?
Yes, General Turgidson is here, but he can't come to the phone now.
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.
Freddie, how are you?
Fine. And you?
Oh, we were just catching up on some of the general's paperwork.
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.
Just a minute.
General Turgidson, a Colonel Puntrich calling.
Tell him to call back.
Freddie, the general says could you call back in a minute?
He says it can't wait.
For Pete's...
Find out what he wants.
The general is in the powder room right now.
Could you tell me what it's about?
Just a second. Apparently they monitored a transmission eight minutes ago... from Burpelson Air Force Base.
Right. It was directed to the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.
Do I have to think of everything?
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.
Oh. All communications are dead!
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.
The general asks if you could possibly try again yourself.
I see. He says he's tried personally several times, but everything is dead.
Even the normal phone lines are shut down.
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?
Yeah?
Well, are you sure it's Plan R?
Huh. What's cooking on the threat board?
Nothing? Nothing at all?
I don't like the look of this.
Tell you what you better do, old buddy.
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast and bump everything up to condition red.
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?
No place.
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
The air force never sleeps.
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.
I know how it is, baby.
Tell you what you do.
You start your countdown and old Bucky will be back... before you can say "Blastoff!"
Your Commie has no regard for human life, not even his own.
For this reason, men, I want to impress upon you the need...
for extreme watchfullness.
The enemy may come individually or he may come in strength.
He may even come in the uniform of our own troops.
But however he comes, we must stop him.
We must not allow him to gain entrance to this base.
Now, I am going to give you three simple rules.
First: Trust no one, whatever his uniform or rank...
unless he is known to you personally.
Secondly: Anyone or anything... that approaches within 200 yards of the perimeter is to be fired upon.
Third: If in doubt, shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
I would sooner accept a few casualties through accident...
than lose the entire base and its personnel through carelessness.
Any variation on these rules must come from me personally.
Now, men, in conclusion...
I would like to say that in the two years...
that it has been my privilege to be your commanding officer...
I have always expected the best from you...
and you have never given me anything less than that.
Today the nation is counting on us.
We are not going to let them down.
Good luck to you all.
Here's the attack profile, sir.
This is your attack profile.
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor voice transmission... or plant false transmission... the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.
The emergency base code prefix is to be set...
on the dials of the C.R.M.
This will block any transmission other than those preceded by a code prefix. "
Stand by to set code prefix.
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.
"Set code prefix."
Code prefix set.
"Lock code prefix."
Code prefix locked.
"Switch all receiver circuits to C.R.M. Discriminators."
Switched to C.R.M. Discriminators.
"Check auto destruct circuits."
Auto destruct circuits checked.
"Primary target:
The I.C.B.M. Complex at Laputa.
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...
Thirty megaton nuclear device...
fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.
Twenty megaton nuclear device will be used if first malfunctions.
Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:
Missile complex seven miles east of Borchov.
Target reference:
November, bravo, Xray...
Fused air burst at 10..."
Check..."12,000 feet."
Excuse me, sir. Something rather interesting has just cropped up.
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.
I think the Pentagon has given us an exercise to check our readiness.
I think it's taking things too far.
Our fellows will be inside Russian radar cover in about 20 minutes.
Listen. Chock full of stations all churning it out.
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?
I issued instructions for all radios to be impounded.
You did, and I was in the process of impounding this when I switched it on.
I thought our fellows hitting Russian radar, dropping all their stuff...
I'd better tell you because if they do, it'll cause a stink.
Group Captain, the officer exchange program... does not give you any special prerogatives to question my orders.
I realize that, sir, but I thought you'd be pleased to hear the news.
After all, let's face it.
We don't want to start a nuclear war unless we have to, do we?
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.
Yes, sir.
What about the planes? Surely we must issue the recall code immediately.
The planes are not going to be recalled.
My attack orders have been issued, and the orders stand.
If you'll excuse me for saying so, that would be to my way of thinking... rather an odd way of looking at it
If a Russian attack was in progress... we would certainly not be hearing civilian broadcasting.
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.
What if it is true?
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir, because I mean... if a Russian attack was not in progress... then your use of Plan R... In fact, your orders to the entire Wing...
I would say, sir, that there was something dreadfully wrong somewhere
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?
Please make me a drink of grain alcohol and rainwater... and help yourself to whatever you'd like.
General Ripper, sir, as an officer in Her Majesty's Air Force... it is my clear duty under the present circumstances... to issue the recall code upon my own authority and bring back the Wing.
If you'll excuse me, sir.
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the recall code. Have you got them handy?
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.
There's nothing anybody can do now.
I'm the only person who knows the three-letter code group.
I must insist that you give them to me!
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening a brother officer with a gun?
Mandrake, I suppose it never occurred to you... that while we're chatting here so enjoyably... a decision is being made by the president... and the joint chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
When they realize there is no possibility of recalling the Wing... there will be only one course of action open.
Total commitment.
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.
He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
When he said that 50 years ago... he might have been right.
But today... war is too important to be left to politicians.
They have neither the time, the training... nor the inclination for strategic thought.
I can no longer sit back and allow...
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...
Communist subversion... and the international
Communist conspiracy... to sap and impurify... all of our precious bodily fluids.
Staines, is everybody here?
Mr. President, the secretary of state is in Vietnam.
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and the vice president is in Mexico City.
We can establish contact with them at anytime. The undersecretaries are here.
Right. General Turgidson, what's going on?
Mr. President... about 35 minutes ago...
GeneralJack Ripper, the commanding general... of Burpelson Air Force Base... issued an order to the 34 B-52s of his Wing... which were airborne at the time... as part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.
It appears that the order called for the planes... to attack their targets inside Russia.
The planes are fully armed with nuclear weapons... with an average load of 40 megatons each.
The central display of Russia will indicate the position of the planes.
The triangles are their primary targets.
The squares are their secondary targets.
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand.
I understood I was the only one to order the use of nuclear weapons.
That's right, sir. You are the only person authorized to do so.
And although I hate to judge before all the facts are in... it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.
Perhaps you're forgetting the provisions of Plan R, sir.
Plan R?
Plan R is an emergency war plan... in which a lower echelon commander may order... nuclear retaliation after a sneak attack... if the normal chain of command has been disrupted.
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.
Surely you must recall, sir, when Senator Beaufort made... that big hassle about our deterrent lacking credibility.
The idea was for Plan R to be a sort of retaliatory safeguard.
A safeguard?
I admit the human element seems to have failed us here.
But the idea was to discourage the Ruskies from any hope... they could knock out Washington, and yourself, as part of a sneak attack... and escape retaliation because of lack of proper command and control.
I assume the planes will return automatically... once they reach their fail-safe points.
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding at their fail-safe points... when the go code was issued.
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do not require a second order to proceed.
They will continue until they reach their target.
Then why haven't you radioed the planes, countermanding the go code?
We're unable to communicate with any of the aircraft.
Why?
As you may recall, sir... one of the provisions of Plan R provides... that once the go code is received... the normal S.S.B. Radios in the aircraft... are switched into a special coded device... which I believe is designated as C.R.M. 114.
In order to prevent the enemy from issuing fake or confusing orders...
C.R.M. 114 is designed not to receive at all... unless the message is proceeded by the correct three-letter code group prefix.
You mean to tell me you will be unable to recall the aircraft?
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through... every possible three-letter combination of the code.
But since there are
17,000 permutations... it's going to take us about two and a half days to transmit them all.
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off the base and cut off communications.
Where did you get this information?
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters... shortly after he issued the go code.
I have a portion of the conversation transcript if you'd like me to read it.
Read it.
The duty officer asked
General Ripper... to confirm the fact that he had issued the go code and he said:
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way in and no one can bring them back.
For the sake of our country and our way of life...
I suggest you get the rest of SAC in after them.
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed by Red retaliation.
My boys will give you the best kind of start: 1,400 megatons worth.
And you sure as hell won't stop them now.
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.
God willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear... and in true health through the purity... and essence of our natural... fluids.
God bless you all."
Then he hung up.
We're still trying to figure out the meaning of that last phrase, sir.
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.
I'd like to hold off judgment until all the facts are in.
General Turgidson, when you instituted the human reliability tests... you assured me there was no possibility of such a thing ever occurring.
Well, I don't think it's fair to condemn a whole program... because of a single slipup, sir.
I want to speak to General Ripper on the telephone.
That's impossible.
General Turgidson, I am becoming less and less interested... in your estimates of what is possible and impossible.
General Faceman.
Yes, sir?
Are there any army units stationed near Burpelson?
I'll just check, sir.
Hello?
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.
My president needs me.
Of course Bucky would rather be there with you.
Of course it isn't only physical.
I deeply respect you as a human being.
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.
All right. Listen, don't forget to say your prayers.
Apparently, the 23rd Airborne Division... is stationed seven miles away at Alvarado.
General Faceman, I want them to enter the base, locate General Ripper... and put him in immediate telephone contact with me.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President?
If I may advise.
Under a condition red, it is standard procedure that the base be sealed off... and the base defended by base security troops.
Any force trying to enter would certainly encounter heavy casualties.
General Turgidson, with all due respect for your defense team... my boys can brush them aside without too much trouble.
Mr. President, there are one or two points I'd like to make, if I may?
Go ahead, General.
One: Our hopes for recalling the 843rd Bomb Wing... are quickly being reduced to a very low order of probability.
Two: In less than 15 minutes from now... the Ruskies will be making radar contact with the planes.
Three: When they do... they will go absolutely ape and strike back with everything they've got.
Four: If prior to this time... we have done nothing to suppress their retaliatory capabilities... we will suffer virtual annihilation.
Five: Lf, on the other hand... we immediately launched an attack on their airfields and missile bases... we'd stand a damn good chance of catching them with their pants down.
Hell, we've got a five-to-one missile superiority.
We could easily assign three missiles to every target... and still have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency.
Six: An unofficial study which we undertook of this eventuality... indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.
We would therefore prevail... and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties... from their remaining force which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated.
General, it is the avowed policy of our country... never to strike first with nuclear weapons.
Well, Mr. President, General Ripper has already invalidated that policy.
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.
Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching a moment of truth... both for ourselves as human beings and for the life of our nation.
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.
But it is necessary now to make a choice:
To choose between two admittedly regrettable... but nevertheless distinguishable postwar environments.
One, where 20 million people are killed; the other, 150 people killed.
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.
Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed.
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!
Depending on the breaks.
I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!
It might be better if you were more concerned... with the American people than with your image in the history books.
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.
Thank you very much.
Mr. President, they have the ambassador waiting upstairs.
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.
Yes, sir.
Is that the Russian ambassador?
Yes, it is, General.
Am I to understand the Russian ambassador... is to be admitted entrance to the War Room?
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.
I don't know exactly how to put this, sir... but are you aware of what a breach of security that would be?
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.
That is precisely the idea, General.
That is precisely the idea.
Staines, get Premier Kissoff on the hot line.
"Survival kit contents check.
In them you will find one.45 caliber automatic...
two boxes of ammunition...
four days concentrated emergency rations... one drug issue containing antibiotics... morphine, vitamin pills, pep pills...
sleeping pills, tranquilizer pills...
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...
$ 100 in rubles...
$ 100 in gold...
nine packs of chewing gum... one issue of prophylactics... three lipsticks, three pair of nylon stockings."
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.
I will have poached eggs. And bring me some cigars, please. Havana cigars.
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.
Try one of theseJamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.
Thank you, no. I do not support the work of imperialist stooges.
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?
Mr. President.
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk vomit all over us like this?
Mr. President?
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is... and he won't be back for two hours.
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.
You would never have found him through his office.
Our premier is a man of the people, but he is also a man, if you follow.
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?
I said Premier Kissoff is a degenerate atheistic Commie!
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.
This clumsy fool tried to plant that ridiculous camera on me.
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this, Mr. President.
This lousy Commie rat was taking pictures with this of the big board!
Mr. Ambassador!
This clumsy fool attempted to plant that ridiculous camera on me.
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.
This is outrageous. I have never heard of such behavior in the War Room before.
Mr. President, I think they're getting him on the line.
You got to hand it to those Commies.
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like the real thing, don't they?
I wonder where they got them from.
Probably bought them from the army as war surplus.
Okay, open up at 200 yards.
Tell him where you are and that you'll speak if I say anything untrue... but nothing more than that.
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.
But I don't have a phone.
Give him the phone.
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?
Listen, I can't hear too well.
Could you turn the music down a little?
That's much better.
Yeah. Yeah.
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.
Clear and plain and coming through fine.
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.
Well, then, as you say, we're both coming through fine. Good.
It's good that you're fine... and I'm fine.
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.
Now, Dimitri... you know how we've always talked about the possibility... of something going wrong with the bomb.
The bomb, Dimitri.
The hydrogen bomb.
Well, now, what happened is... one of our base commanders, he had a sort of...
Well, he went a little funny in the head.
You know, just a little funny.
And he went and did a silly thing.
I'll tell you what he did.
He ordered his planes... to attack your country.
Let me finish, Dimitri.
Let me finish, Dimitri.
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?
Can you imagine how I feel about it, Dimitri?
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?
Of course I like to speak to you!
Of course I like to say hello!
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.
I'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has happened.
Of course, it's a friendly call.
Listen, if it wasn't friendly, you probably wouldn't have even got it.
They will not reach their targets for at least another hour.
I am positive, Dimitri.
I've been all over this with your ambassador.
It is not a trick.
I'll tell you.
We'd like to give your Air Staff a complete rundown on the targets... the flight plans and defensive systems of the planes.
Yes, if we're unable to recall the planes...
I'd say, well... we're just gonna have to help you destroy them, Dimitri.
I know they're our boys.
Listen. Now, who should we call?
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.
Where is that, Dimitri?
In Omsk. Right.
Yes.
You'll call them first, will you?
Do you happen to have the phone number on you, Dimitri?
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.
Don't say that you're more sorry than I am... because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are.
So we're both sorry, all right?
All right.
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants to talk to you. Just a second.
What?
What? What is it? What?
The fools. The mad fools.
What's happened?
The doomsday machine.
The doomsday machine?
What is that?
A device which will destroy all human and animal life on Earth.
All human and animal life?
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?
Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.
Vodka. That's what they drink, isn't it? Never water.
I believe that's what they drink, yes.
On no account will a Commie ever drink water... and not without good reason.
Oh, yes.
I can't quite see what you're getting at.
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.
Mandrake, water is the source of all life.
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface is water.
Why, do you realize that...
70% of you is water?
Good Lord.
And as human beings, you and I need fresh, pure water... to replenish our precious bodily fluids.
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.
Have you never wondered why I drink only distilled water... or rainwater, and only pure grain alcohol?
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.
Have you ever heard of fluoridation of water?
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.
Do you know what it is?
No, no, I don't know what it is.
Do you realize that fluoridation... is the most monstrously conceived... and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to face?
Two can play at that game, soldier.
That's nice shooting, soldier!
Mandrake, come here.
You calling me, Jack?
Come over here and help me with this belt.
I haven't had very much experience... with those sort of machines.
I've only ever pressed a button in my old Spitfire.
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.
Jack, I'd love to come, but what's happened, you see... the string in my leg is gone.
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.
When it is detonated, it will produce enough radioactive fallout... so that in ten months... the surface of the Earth will be as dead as the moon!
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!
Our studies show even the worst fallout is down to a safe level after two weeks.
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?
Cobalt thorium G has a radioactive half-life of 93 years.
If you take 50 H bombs in the 100 megaton range... and jacket them with cobalt thorium G... when they are exploded, they will produce a doomsday shroud... a lethal cloud of radioactivity... which will encircle the Earth for 93 years!
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.
I'm afraid I don't understand something, Alexi.
Is the premier threatening to explode it if our planes carry out their attack?
No, sir. It is not a thing a sane man would do.
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.
Surely you can disarm it somehow.
It is designed to explode if any attempt is made to un-trigger it.
Automatically?
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?
There are those of us who fought against it.
But in the end, we could not keep up with the expense involved... in the arms race, the space race and the peace race.
At the same time, our people grumbled for more nylons and washing machines.
Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction... of what we have been spending on defense in a single year.
The deciding factor was when we learned your country was working similarly... and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!
This is preposterous! I've never approved of anything like that.
Our source was The New York Times.
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything like that in the works?
A moment, please, Mr. President.
Under the authority granted me... as director of weapons research and development...
I commissioned last year a study of this project... by the Bland Corporation.
Based on the findings of the report... my conclusion was that this idea was not a practical deterrent... for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious.
You mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing?
Mr. President, the technology required is easily within the means... of even the smallest nuclear power.
It requires only the will to do so.
But how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically... and at the same time impossible to un-trigger?
Mr. President, it is not only possible... it is essential.
That is the whole idea of this machine, you know.
Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy... the fear of attack.
And so because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process... which rules out human meddling... the doomsday machine is terrifying... and simple to understand... and completely credible and convincing.
I wish we had one of them doomsday machines.
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?
It's remarkably simple to do that.
When you merely wish to bury bombs... there's no limit to the size.
After that, they are connected... to a gigantic complex of computers.
Now then, a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances... under which the bombs are to be exploded... is programmed into a tape memory bank.
Hmm. Strangelove?
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?
He changed it when he became a citizen.
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.
Well, a Kraut by any other name, uh, Stainsey?
The whole point of the doomsday machine... is lost if you keep it a secret!
Why didn't you tell the world?
It was to be announced at the Party Congress on Monday.
As you know, the premier loves surprises.
Stay with me, Mandrake.
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.
Don't you think we'd be better off away from this flying glass?
We're okay here.
Mandrake, do you realize that in addition to fluoridating the water... there are studies underway to fluoridate salt, flour... fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream?
Ice cream.
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.
You know when fluoridation first began?
No, I don't, Jack.
1946, Mandrake.
How does that coincide with your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?
A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids... without the knowledge of the individual.
Certainly without any choice.
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.
Jack. Tell me, Jack.
When did you first become...
Well, develop this theory?
Well, l...
I first became aware of it, Mandrake... during the physical act of love.
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue... feeling of emptiness followed.
Luckily I was able to interpret these feelings correctly.
Loss of essence.
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.
Women sense my power... and they seek the life essence.
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.
But I do deny them my essence.
Yes, yes, Jack.
Cease fire!
My boys must have surrendered.
There it is.
Jack, listen.
While there's still time, I beg you, let's recall the Wing and...
Those boys were like my children.
Now they let me down.
No, not a bit.
I'm sure they all gave it their very best.
I'm equally sure they all died thinking of you... every man jack of them, Jack.
Supposing a bit of water has gone off, eh?
Certainly one can never be too sure about those things.
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?
Look at me, Jack. Look.
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.
And I can swear to you, my boy, swear to you... that there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids.
Not a thing, Jackie.
Mandrake, were you ever a prisoner of war?
Well, Jack, the time's running very...
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
Did they torture you?
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by theJapanese.
Not a pretty story.
What happened?
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult to think under these conditions.
Well, what happened was... they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.
I was laying train lines for the bloodyJapanese puff-puffs.
No, I mean, when they tortured you, did you talk?
No, l...
Well, I don't think they wanted me to talk, really, or say anything.
It was their way of having a bit of fun, the swine.
The strange thing is, they make such bloody good cameras.
Those clowns outside will give me a good going-over soon for the code.
Yes, you may have quite a point there, Jack.
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.
The answer to that is, no one ever does.
And my advise to you is to give me the code now.
If those devils come back and try any rough stuff... we'll fight them together like we did just now on the floor.
You with your gun and me with a belt of ammo, feeding you.
"Feed me," you said, and I was feeding you, Jack.
You know, Mandrake...
I happen to believe in a life after this one... and I know I'll have to answer for what I've done.
And I think I can.
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.
I'm a religious man myself, you know.
I believe in all that sort of thing and I'm hoping, you know, Jack...
You've dropped your gun, Jack.
No, Jack, let me take that for you.
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping you're going to give me the code, boy.
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.
Always did wonders for a man, a wash and brush up.
Water on the back of the neck makes you feel marvelous.
That's what we need: Water on the back of the neck and the code.
Supposing I play a little guessing game with you, Jack boy?
I'll try and guess what the code is...
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.
We have 109,000 total...
79,000 in the mains...
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.
And that works out to roughly...
seven hours, 15 minutes endurance from this time.
D.S.O. To Captain.
I have an unidentified radar blip.

P.O.E.
Purity of Essence.
O.P.O.E.
Put your hands over your head.
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?
Put your hands over your head.
What kind of suit do you call that, fella?
What do you mean, suit?
This happens to be an R.A.F. Uniform... and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.
Where's General Ripper?
He's dead, in the bathroom.
Where's the bathroom?
Next to you.
I don't know what stupid game this is you're playing... but I've got a good idea what the recall code is... and I have to get in touch with SAC headquarters immediately!
Put your hands over your head and keep 'em there! Go on.
Got any witnesses?
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!
While he was shavin'?
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano... if that really is your name... may I tell you that I have a very good idea...
I think, hope, pray... what the recall code is.
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence," one of those.
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walkin'.
Don't you know that General Ripper went mad... and sent the whole Wing to attack the Soviets?
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
I'm going to pick up this red telephone, which is connected to SAC... and I hope...
Blast. Blast.
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men during this ridiculous fighting!
Right.
All right, Charlie, I've been wastin' too much time on you.
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walkin'.
All the radio gear is out, including the C.R.M. 114.
I think the auto-destruct mechanism got hit and blew itself up.
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.
Roger. Navigator?
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.
This gives us a radius of action sufficient to take out...
primary and secondary targets, but we will not... repeat, not be able to make it back to any base or neutral country.
However, we would have enough fuel to ditch...
at weather ship Tango Delta...
grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.
Well, boys, we got three engines out.
We got more holes in us than a horse trader's mule.
The radio is gone, and we're leakin' fuel.
And if we was flyin' any lower, we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.
But we got one little budge on them Ruskies.
At this height they might harpoon us... but they sure ain't gonna spot us on no radar screen.
The other way.
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.
Colonel, I must know what you think has been going on here.
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.
I think you're some kind of deviated "prevert."
I think General Ripper found out about your "preversion"... and that you were organizing some kind of mutiny of"preverts."
Now, move!
On top of that, I don't know anything about any planes attacking Russia.
I was told to get Ripper on the phone with the President of the United States.
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."
What about the president?
The president wants to speak to General Ripper, doesn't he?
Now, General Ripper is dead, is he not?
I am General Ripper's executive officer... so the president will want to speak to me, won't he?
There's a telephone box over there and the line may be open.
You wanna talk to the President of the United States?
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.
And if you don't put that gun away and stop this stupid nonsense... the Court of Inquiry on this will give you such a pranging... you'll be lucky to end up wearing the uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!
Go ahead, try and get the President of the United States on the phone.
Try any "preversions,"
I'll blow your head off.
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.
Something urgent has come up and I want you to place a person-to-person call... with President Merkin Muffley in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.
Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.
Could you make this a collect call, Operator?
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.
Have you got 55 cents?
Do you think I'd go into combat with loose change in my pocket?
Operator, look.
Is it possible to make this an ordinary trunk call?
Well, what do you call it?
You know...
Oh, station-to-station.
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.
There may be change in there.
That's private property.
Can you possibly imagine what is going to happen to you... your frame outlook, way of life and everything... when they learn you have obstructed a phone call to the president?
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!
Shoot with the gun! That's what the bullets are for, you twit!
Okay, I'm gonna get your money for you.
But if you don't get the president on the phone, you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.
This is SAC
Communications Control.
The recall code O.P. E...
is being acknowledged "roger"...
by elements of the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.
These are the details.
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...
are reported destroyed by enemy action.
All other missions have acknowledged recall code.
This is SAC Communications Control.
Over and out.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President.
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature... but I think I know what's in every heart in this room.
I think we all ought to bow our heads... and give a prayer of thanks for our deliverance.
Lord... we have heard the wings of the Angel of Death... fluttering over our heads from the Valley of Fear.
You have seen fit to deliver us from the forces of evil...
Excuse me, sir.
Premier Kissoff s calling again and he's hopping mad.
Fuel flow on active engines and leakage has increased.
Now works out at 2-0-5.
Estimate remaining fuel...
at 8-7-9-0.
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...
and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.
No, no, Dimitri, there must be some mistake.
No, I'm certain of that.
I'm perfectly certain of that, Dimitri.
Just a second.
You know what he says?
He says one of the planes hasn't turned back.
He says according to information forwarded by our Air Staffs... it's headed for the missile complex at Laputa.
That's impossible, Mr. President.
I mean, look at the big board.
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls acknowledged and four splashes... and one of them was targeted for Laputa.
Dimitri, look, we've got an acknowledgement from every plane... except the four you've shot down.
Hang on a second, Dimitri.
He says their air defense now only claims three aircraft confirmed.
The fourth may only be damaged.
Mr. President...
I'm beginnin' to smell a big, fat Commie rat.
I mean, supposin' Kissoff is lyin' about that fourth plane... just lookin' for an excuse to clobber us?
If the spaghetti hits the fan, we're in trouble.
Dimitri, look, if this report is true... and the plane manages to bomb the target... is this gonna set off the doomsday machine?
Are you sure?
Well, I guess you're just gonna have to get that plane, Dimitri.
I'm sorry they're jamming your radar and flying so low... but they're trained to do it.
It's initiative.
Look, Dimitri, you know exactly where they're going... and I'm sure your entire air defense can stop a single plane.
It's not gonna help either one of us if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?
There's no point in you getting hysterical at a moment like this!
Keep your feet on the ground when you're talking, Dimitri.
I am not...
I am not getting...
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.
That's all.
Now look, if our Air Staffs say its primary target is Laputa... and its secondary target is Borchov, it's true.
You gotta believe it!
Dimitri, can I give you just one word...
Can I give you just one word of advice, Dimitri?
Listen, Dimitri.
Put everything you've got into those two sectors, and you can't miss!
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel at the present rate...
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time... which will not even take us as far as the primary.
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that you could get me to the primary!
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based on the original loss rate factor... not at 2-0-5.
I don't give a hoot in hell how you do it... you just get me to the primary, you hear?
I'm sorry, sir, but those are the figures.
We'll be lucky to reach weather ship at Tango Delta.
Well, shoot!
We ain't come this far just to dump this thing in the drink.
What's the nearest target of opportunity?
Sir, if the rate of loss does not increase... we have a chance to reach target 3-8-4... grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1... and possibly make it from there to the Tango Delta weather ship.
What kind of a target is that, anyhow?
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
Complex at Kotloss.
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.
Give me a headin'on that just as soon as you get it worked out.
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.
We're right behind you, we're with you all the way.
Yes. We'll keep the line open.
All right, Dimitri.
General Turgidson... is there really a chance for that plane to get through?
Mr. President, if I may speak freely.
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly we think he's short of know-how.
You can't expect ignorant peons to understand a machine like our boys.
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.
We all know how much guts the average Ruskie's got.
Look at all of them Nazis killed off, and they still wouldn't quit!
Can't you stick to the point?
Well, sir, if the pilot's good, see...
I mean, if he's really sharp, he can barrel that baby in so low.
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!
Its jet exhaust fryin' chickens in the barnyard!
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

Where in hell is Major Kong?
What about Major Kong?
Mr. President, I would not rule out the chance... to preserve a nucleus of human specimens.
It would be quite easy... at the bottom of some of our deeper mine shafts.
The radioactivity would never penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements in dwelling space... could easily be provided.
How long would you have to stay down there?
Well, that's, you know...
Cobalt thorium G.
Radioactive half-life of...
I would think that possibly one hundred years.
You mean, people could actually stay down there for 100 years?
It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.
Nuclear reactors could...
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely.
Greenhouses could maintain plant life.
Animals could be bred and slaughtered.
A quick survey would have to be made of the available mine sites in the country.
But I would guess that a dwelling space... for several hundred thousand of our people could easily be provided.
Well, I would hate to have to decide... who stays up and who goes down.
Well, that would not be necessary, Mr. President.
It could easily be accomplished with a computer.
And the computer could be set and programmed... to accept factors from youth, health... sexual fertility, intelligence... and a cross-section of necessary skills.
Of course, it would be absolutely vital... that our top government and military men be included... to foster and impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
Naturally, they would breed prodigiously.
There would be much time and little to do.
But with the proper breeding techniques and a ratio of, say... ten females to each male... they could then work their way back to the present gross national product... within 20 years.
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors... be so grief-stricken and anguished that they... well, envy the dead and not want to go on living?
No, sir. Excuse me.
When they go down into the mine, everyone would still be alive.
There would be no shocking memories... and the prevailing emotion will be one of nostalgia for those left behind... combined with a spirt of... bold curiosity for the adventure ahead!
Doctor... you mentioned the ratio of ten women to each man.
Now, wouldn't that necessitate the abandonment... of the so-called monogamous sexual relationship?
I mean, as far as men were concerned?
Regrettably, yes.
But it is a sacrifice required for the future of the human race.
I hasten to add that since each man will be required to do prodigious... service along these lines... the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics... which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature.
I must confess, you have an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.
Thank you, sir.
We ought to look at this from the military point of view.
I mean, supposing the Ruskies... stashed away some big bombs, see, and we didn't?
When they come out in 100 years, they could take over!
I agree, Mr. President.
They might try a sneak attack so they could take over our mine shaft space.
It'd be extremely naive of us to imagine that these new developments... are gonna cause any change in Soviet expansionist policy!
I mean, we must be increasingly on the alert... to prevent them from taking over other mine shaft space... in order to breed more prodigiously than we do... thus knocking us out through superior numbers when we emerge!
Mr. President, we must not allow a mine-shaft gap!
Sir!
I have a plan...
Mein Fuhrer...
I can walk!
- Allora, come stai, Leone?
- Bene
Okay, okay. Let's talk business.
This fat bastard is trying to move in on Morizio's business.
And you know, Morizio is a reasonable guy.
He just wants a little conversation.
But this guy, he don't wanna hear about it.
Maybe he'll listen to you.
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.
Nice to see you again,
Mr Jones.
Remember, neatness counts.
You got one half hour.
One hour.
Yeah, what?
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.
What's he look like?
Serious.
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.
We got company.
Come on.
Stop, stop, man!
Tell the driver to wait for us out back, and hurry up.
- Hey sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.
It's cool. Take a nap.
Oh, my God.
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.
Check the terrace!
- 911 emergency.
- I need help.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Alright, just stay on the line.
I'll just be off a moment.
Sir, I'm gonna connect you with an officer.
Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?
I'll call you back.
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia sitting in them suitcases over here.
Ain't been cut yet. Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.
Dial this number.
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?
Bye.
- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. No, I mean, no.
Just for today.
Aha, so it's safe to say today's your last day in town... and we'll never see your fat fucking face again.
Yeah. Right.
Let me speak to our mutual friend.
He wants to talk to you.
Make sure he understands, and let him go.
Do you understand?
- So say it.
- I understand.
Good.
Jesus.
Hola! Qué tal amigo? Two milk as usual, eh?
Why did you hide the cigarette?
This building's full of rats.
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.
What happened?
I fell off my bike.
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know-
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.
What's my job? I'm just a holder.
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.
- I don't even know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me, alright?
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.
Now it's July, we pick up the dope, and it tests 90 percent pure.
Somewhere between June and July, ten percent turned to cut!
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.
- That's all I know.
- You know I'm trying to help you out here... but if you're gonna be a hard-ass about it...
I gotta disturb him.
When he's into his music, he hates being disturbed.
I'm telling you the truth.
I hope so, because he's got a talent for sniffing out a lie.
It's scary.
It's almost like a sixth sense.
Are you gonna change your tune or I gotta bust into his?
I'm telling you the truth.
All right.
Stan.
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.
Of course he didn't.
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did by tomorrow.
Noon.
Malky, wait.
I didn't cut your shit.
Find out yourself!
What are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister... clean up the goddamn house!
And stop smoking cigarettes!
One!
Two. Take a deep breath in.
Take a deep breath out.
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.
Change the channel, and I'll smash your face.
Ready for the legs.
And down.
Sorry, sweetheart.
Squeeze. Release.
Good morning.
Hi, honey.
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass.
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.
Two and up.
Can someone who's doing nothing all day but watching cartoons... move a little ass and go get some food?
- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.
You always come up with something, right?
I think I went too far this time.
You're going too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.
How about working at home today?
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.
- One-
- Now it's my turn!
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!
- Daddy, she's-
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!
Please don't shoot!
Fucking bitch.
- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.
When you use the Quadra-Step, your thigh muscles-
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister... headmistress at the Spencer School in Wildwood, New Jersey.
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?
This is she.
Mrs. Lando, when your husband enrolled Mathilda at Spencer... he told us she had problems
As you know, we pride ourselves on turning troubled girls... into healthy, productive young women.
But if they are not here, there is very little we can do.
Mathilda left school without permission nearly two weeks ago.
I know your husband paid tuition in advance for a year... but if you will refer to the rules and regulations manual we sent you... you will see that unless there is a valid excuse for prolonged absence... your tuition will be forfeit.
She's dead.
Tell that fucking kid to do a little work around here!
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fucking mess.
Hurry up!
Why am I feeling
When things could look black
That nothing could possibly go wrong
This has been
A most unusual day
Love has made me see things
In a different way
Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?
Always like this.
Keep it.
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?
One quart or two?
It's two, right?
I like these calm little moments before the storm.
It reminds me of Beethoven.
Can you hear it?
It's like when you put your head to the grass... you can hear it growing.
You can hear the insects.
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.
I'm gonna play you some.
Daddy!
You better stay here.
We said noon.
I've got one minute past.
You don't like Beethoven.
You don't know what you're missing.
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.
So powerful.
But after his openings, to be honest... he does tend to get a little fucking boring.
That's why I stopped!
Toss the apartment.
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.
I love Mozart!
He was Austrian, you know.
But for this kind of work, he's a little bit light.
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
Man, keep your bombacut mouth shut.
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.
Wow.
Oh! Fuck!
He's dead.
Jesus. Look what you did.
Stan, you all right?
What are you doing?
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.
I'm calm.
Stay there, all right?
Benny!
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!
Take it easy, all right?
Come on.
Come on, let's get a cigarette.
Benny, we're coming out!
Benny, don't fire!
Get in there!
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
You wear something new and-
Got a light?
Take it easy.
What's happening out there?
It's all right, ma'am.
D. E. A. Police.
Leave that poor family alone.
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.
Why don't you leave them alone?
He said go back inside.
Stan, I think it's better if we go inside.
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!
Did you really have to do that?
Please open the door.
Benny, there are three kids here.
I think Stan killed this girl.
Willy, that asshole, shot the little boy.
The third one's missing.
Find her.
Shit. We missed the little girl, man.
I'm gonna find the fucking super in this goddamn building.
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!
Shit.
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!
- They found it.
- I know.
There it is.
There's cops outside.
We better go.
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.
What do I say?
Tell them... we were doing our job.
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it... one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.
Your mother, she-
She's not my mother.
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.
Not a good half at that.
If you couldn't stand them, why are you crying?
They killed my brother.
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.
He never used to cry.
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.
I was more of a mother to him than that goddamned pig ever was.
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.
But they smell like shit.
Not true.
As a matter of fact, right now I have one in my kitchen... that's very clean...
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.
Yes, I do.
I was just in there, and I didn't see any goddamned pig.
Don't move.
I'll get him.
Piggy, where are you?
There you are.
Hi, Mathilda.
Hi, piggy.
How are you today?
I've seen better days.
- What's your name?
- Leon.
Cute name.
You have anyone to go to, any family anyplace else?
I'm gonna get some more milk.
Holy shit.
Don't touch that, please.
What do you do for a living?
Cleaner.
You're a hit man?
Cool.
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.
How much would it cost to hire someone to get those dirt bags... who killed my brother?
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.
How about I work for you... and in exchange, you teach me how to clean?
What do you think?
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.
I'll even wash your clothes.
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.
You've had a rough day today.
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow.
You've been really great with me, Leon... and it's not always like that.
You know?
Good night.
You sleep well?
Good.
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?
Not my problem.
Read it.
You don't know how to read.
I'm learning, but I've had a lot of work lately... so I'm a little behind.
What's it say?
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?
I've been nothing but nice to you.
I saved your life yesterday, right outside the door.
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.
If you saved my life, you must've saved it for a good reason.
If you throw me out now, it's like you never opened your door... like you let me die right there in front of it.
But you did open it. So-
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.
I don't wanna die tonight.
You're just a little girl.
Don't take it badly, but I don't think you could do it.
I'm sorry.
How's that?
Don't you ever do that again or I'll break your head.
You got that?
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.
There is rules.
And stop saying okay all the time!
Good.
You expect to use that in this hotel?
Mister, I have to use it... because I have an audition at Juilliard next month... and I have to practice.
Okay, but not after 10:00.
- I promise.
- All right.
I'll put you at the end of the hall... so that you don't disturb anyone.
Fill those out, please.
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.
Fourth floor!
Thanks, mister!
You're lucky to have a little girl that's interested in things.
I have a kid, 17, does nothing all day long.
Can I leave my plant here while I take my stuff upstairs?
Of course.
I'm putting in a name of a girl in my class who makes me sick.
If things get hot, she'll take the heat.
There. Finished.
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?
No. You just look a little young.
Thanks.
Leon, I want you to teach me how to be like you.
I want to be strong and smart like you.
I know I'm not strong enough yet... but I could learn the basics, the theory.
What do you think?
Just the theory.
I need this, Leon.
I need time to get my head together.
Yeah, and I need... a drink.
Don't move.
I'll go get one.
When you told me to get this baby out for you...
I thought my hearing was going.
I says to myself, Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners
I like to stay in shape.
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.
It's like me. I gotta know where everything is all the time.
I never leave this place, except to go from here to there.
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?
Check it.
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.
One thing's got nothing to do with the other. Remember that.
I will.
The rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use... because it lets you keep your distance from the client.
The closer you get to being a pro... the closer you can get to the client.
The knife, for example, is the last thing you learn.
Position.
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.
They can see you coming from a mile away.
And always dress down.
Never brighter than the floor, okay?
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.
Who should I hit?
Whoever.
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.
Jogger in the yellow and orange?
Keep calm.
Don't take your eyes off him.
Breathe easy.
Watch his movement.
Pretend you're running with him.
Try to feel his next movement.
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.
Now.
Oh, my God!
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?
One shot. Not bad, huh?
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.
Can we try with real bullets now?
Not today.
Let's pack up.
Like that.
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.
It seemed... to Socrates-
I'll do it.
Leon, all we do is work.
We need a break.
Let's play a game.
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.
It makes you think and helps your memory. It's exactly what you need.
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Mr. President
I don't know.
Moustache.
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
- What a beaut-
- Gene Kelly?
Good.
Your turn now.
Okay, pilgrim.
Clint Eastwood?
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.
Leon, really brilliant.
Amazing.
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.
Always happy.
No questions.
It's like me, you see.
No roots.
If you really love it, you should plant it in a park so it can have roots.
You should be watering me if you want me to grow.
You're right.
Wait!
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.
It's been a long time, Leon.
I missed you.
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.
Training's good, but don't overdo it.
Training don't pay as good as working, Leon.
Tony... all the money I make, that you keep for me-
You need some money?
Just curious.
I've been working a long time... and I haven't done anything with my money.
I thought maybe someday I could use it.
You met a woman.
You gotta be careful with women.
Remember when you arrived in this country?
When I took you in, you were still wet behind the fucking ears... and, already, you were in deep shit because of a woman.
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.
You know, about my money-
Maybe I could give... a little... to someone.
You know, to help out.
It's your money. I'm just holding it for you, like a bank.
Except better than a bank because banks always get knocked off.
No one knocks off old Tony.
Besides, with a bank... there's always tons of forms and all that shit.
But old Tony, nothing to read, nothing to write. It's all in his head.
I know how to read now.
That's good, Leon.
Your money's here.
Whenever you want it, you just ask me.
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.
All right.
Now let's talk business.
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.
Manolo, a glass of milk for my friend Leon here.
Listen, Mathilda, you gotta be careful.
You can't just speak to any guy off the street.
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?
I was just smoking a butt while I was waiting.
I want you to stop cursing.
You can't talk to people like that all the time.
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.
Leon, I think I'm kinda falling in love with you.
It's the first time for me, you know.
How do you know it's love if you've never been in love before?
'Cause I feel it.
Where?
In my stomach.
It's all warm.
I always had a knot there, and now it's gone.
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't have a stomachache anymore.
I don't think it means anything.
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.
How's the practicing going?
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.
I understand.
But you're doing all right.
I haven't received any complaints.
I put a cloth over the strings to lessen the noise.
That's very smart.
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.
What does your father do?
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.
Except he's not really my father.
He's my lover.
Think I'll go for a walk.
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?
- Where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.
You got plans?
Meet you here?
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.
If you'll just take us step-by-step through exactly what happened.
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.
Bang, we shot him.
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!
They should have been at school, don't you think?
Your statement said you were the first man in.
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?
Cooperation.
I haven't got time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.
Kids should be at school.
Come on, that's my ball!
Give that back.
Where you going?
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!
Follow the blue car.
You want me to blast the music and go through the lights?
No, drive slowly.
Take the hundred bucks, and shut the fuck up.
I do not want to fight you, but you leave me no choice.
Boy, you just gave me a great idea!
- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily... our 30-minute look at the latest in entertainment news.
I'm Bianca Ferrar.
It's for you.
A present.
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?
Mr. McGuffin?
Can I have a word with you?
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?
His name is Norman Stansfield, and he's in room 4602... in the D. E. A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?
- It's too heavy.
- Well.
Will you rent me your gear for the day?
I never lend out my gear.
But... you still have your gun.
Use it.
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.
Why are you so mean to me?
Wildly killing people you don't give a shit about... but you won't get the bastards that killed my whole family?
Revenge is not good once you're done. Believe.
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?
After I've seen the outline of my brother's body on the floor... you expect me to forget?
I want to kill those sons of bitches.
Blow their fucking heads off.
Nothing's the same after you've killed someone.
Your life is changed forever.
You have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of your life.
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.
I want love... or death.
That's it.
I want death.
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.
There's this really great game, Leon.
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.
The kind of game you love.
If I win... you keep me with you... for life.
And if you lose?
Go shopping alone, like before.
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.
So what?
What's it to you if I end up with a bullet in the head?
Nothing.
I hope you're not lying, Leon.
I really hope that deep down inside there's no love in you.
Because if there is... just a little bit of love in there for me...
I think that in a few minutes you'll regret you never said anything.
I love you, Leon.
I win.
I took a hit.
I need a hand now.
I know she's young, but she learns fast.
Kids need to be shaped into something, right?
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?
She's 18.
Really?
How about something to drink, Tony?
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk for Leon.
Nice tattoo.
Manolo, make that two.
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.
First you find out where the chain is.
You can't see it, but you can feel it. Here.
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?
Whatever you want.
- Yes?
- Hi.
It's Susan.
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong door, little girl.
I don't know any Susan.
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.
The light's out.
It's all dark out here.
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.
What the fuck are you doing?
Open up.
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?
Here's okay.
Let it go.
I said, Let it go.
Move. Move over.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Careful.
You want me-
Go ahead. Your turn.
Help me.
Please don't beat me.
Sir?
Sir, it's not my dope.
Sir, look I-
A little left, please.
Before- Ple-
Now, the security shot.
No, the second goes higher on the chest.
Aim for the heart and lungs.
There. Right there.
You see?
The first shot takes him out of order.
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?
Never in the face.
If they can't recognize the client, you don't get paid.
You could take out anybody and said you did the job.
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!
What are you fucking-
You see, when you use the silencer a lot... you have to put a piece of cloth here... because it gets very hot and could burn it inside.
A damp, black cloth is the best.
What you doing?
We said no women, no kids.
Who do you think this is gonna kill, junkies and monkeys?
Now it's clean.
Let's get out of here.
I thought we don't have the right to drink.
I know, but we're making an exception for your first time.
Well, if we're making exceptions for a job well-done... how about a kiss, like in the movies?
Yes.
What you doing?
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.
Come on. Just a kiss.
Stop. Everyone is watching us.
Go sit down.
Enjoy.
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.
So, how old were you when you made your first hit?
Nineteen.
Beat you.
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.
- Yes?
- Hi.
I'm looking for Mr. Reuben's apartment... but it's all dark out here in the hall, and I'm lost.
Just a second.
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.
You think you're going to get me that easily?
When it's tough like this, you know it's gonna be ugly.
Better make it quick or else we'll be all day listening to his crap.
Asshole! Come on, show me your fucking face, faggot!
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.
Show it to me, motherfucker.
That's the ring trick.
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.
Leon, what's up?
All done already?
Nicer than people, eh?
I told you that.
You got a problem?
Get the chair. Sit down.
I was thinking.
If something happens to me someday-
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you. You play with 'em.
Tony, I thought about my money.
You remember the girl who came here the other day?
Her name is Mathilda.
If anything happens to me...
I'd like you... to give her... my money.
You can count on me, Leon.
Thank you, Tony.
I won't be long.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.
This one is too big.
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers, is that it?
Mathilda, since I met you... everything's been different.
So I just need some time alone.
You need some time to grow up a little.
I finished growing up, Leon.
I just get older.
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.
I need time to grow up.
Shit.
Come on! Hustle!
- Good shot.
- Come on.
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.
- Only on T. V.
- What'd you say?
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars... a month.
Got change?
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.
I'll pay now for the rest of the year.
Okay, a year.
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?
So go play somewhere else.
I need to think.
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?
Food.
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.
Sign here.
Come here.
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go to the restroom.
Special delivery?
Let me guess.
Chinese?
Thai, maybe?
I've got it.
Italian food.
What's your name, angel?
I want you to put the sack on the floor.
Good.
Now I want you to tell me everything you know about Italian food.
Don't forget the name of the chef who fixed it for me.
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.
So this is something... personal, is it?
What filthy piece of shit... did I do now?
You killed my brother.
I'm sorry.
And you wanna join him?
It's always the same thing.
It's when you start to become really afraid of death... that you learn to appreciate life.
Do you like life, sweetheart?
That's good.
Because I take no pleasure... in taking a life... if it's from a person who doesn't care about it.
Stan, I've been looking all over for you.
- I checked upstairs-
- What? I'm busy.
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.
Malky was making a buy for us from the Chinaman.
But they got nothing to do with it.
They told me this guy came from the outside. He was a pro.
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead in two seconds.
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.
Then turns around, says something to Malky like-
No women, no kids.
I think it was something personal.
Death is whimsical today.
Blood, do you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.
Would you take her up to my office?
All right.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Leon, my love.
I know where to find the guys who killed my brother.
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D. E. A. building, room 4602.
I'm gonna do them myself.
If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.
It's for a contract.
Five grand ahead, right?
I know I'll feel better after I do this.
I love you.
Wait. I won't be long.
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!
He's gonna do the same exact thing that I said.
A nine millie.
Bullets.
Another nine millie.
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?
Maybe she was planning on taking out the whole building.
Holy shit!
What's this? Lunch.
Careful, Blood, might be poisoned.
There's no anchovies on this.
Is that what you call I won't be long?
I been here for ten minutes.
I did my best.
Do you like it?
Yes.
So say it.
I like it.
Not thirsty?
You know, a girl's first time is very important.
It determines the rest of her life sexually.
I read that once in one of my sister's magazines.
My girlfriends told me they hated their first experience.
That's because they didn't love the guys.
They just did it to show off.
Afterwards, they started liking it, like cigarettes.
Will I like it the first time?
Mathilda, no.
Why not?
I just can't.
- You love someone else?
- No.
I mean-
There was someone a long time ago.
Before I came to the States.
Her father didn't want her to see me.
She was from a very respectable family.
Mine was... you know... not so respectable.
Her dad went nuts every time she'd take off to see me.
She still snuck off to see you, right?
Right.
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.
He killed her.
One shot through the head.
They kept him in jail for two days, and they let him go free.
They said it was an accident.
So... one night I... waited for him.
Five hundred feet with a lens.
He also had an accident.
The same night I took a boat and came here... to meet up with my father who was working for Tony.
I was 19.
Since then I've never left the city, and...
I've never had another girlfriend.
You see, Mathilda...
I wouldn't be a good lover.
Okay.
Would you do me one favor?
What?
I'm sick of watching you sleep on your chair.
We're gonna share the bed.
I don't think it's a good idea.
It's okay.
Put your legs up on the bed.
Yeah. That's nice.
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.
Good night, Leon.
Good night.
I want a piece of cake first!
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.
I have a lot of respect for your business, Tony.
When you've killed for us in the past... we've always been satisfied.
That's exactly why today is going to be very hard for me.
I hope you'll excuse my mood.
My man was killed right here on your turf.
The Chinks tell me that the hit man... was kind of the Italian type.
So we figured that Tony might know something.
Wait. There's more.
You're gonna love this.
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office... armed to the teeth, with the firm intention of sending me to the morgue.
Do you know who came and got her right there in my building?
The very same...
Italian hit man.
I'm dying to meet him.
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.
Yeah, I forgot.
I never saw someone with one eye open snore so much.
- I snore?
- Like a baby.
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.
Don't forget the code when you come back.
Two knocks, then one, and two knocks again. Right?
Right.
Hola señor! Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.
From here on out, you don't make a sound.
You answer my questions by nodding yes or shaking your head no.
Is he alone?
Does he expect you?
Do you have keys to the apartment?
Is there a code, a way of knocking, so he knows it's you?
Alpha team.
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.
What up? Move! Fuck.
Shit.
Alpha team. Man down.
I told you.
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, everyone?
Everyone!
Take this.
Go take a look.
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.
Nobody moves.
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!
Okay, the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!
You're coming with us.
Christ, he shot him!
Bastard!
Move!
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.
Come!
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!
I just went shopping and I came back, and they were everywhere.
Stay away from the window.
Come here.
Snipers.
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole out of there.
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting-
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.
We'll take it and leave together, just the two of us.
Go.
You're saying that so I won't worry.
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.
You've given me a taste for life.
I wanna be happy, sleep in a bed, have roots.
You'll never be alone again.
Please, go now, baby. Go.
Calm down.
Go now. Go.
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna clean them all. Tony's in an hour.
I love you, Mathilda.
I love you, too, Leon.
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.
We've got one breathing here!
Get a medic on the horn!
Clear the hall!
Let him through!
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.
Let's go! Move!
Get that guy off the stairs!
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!
We've got two men coming down the stairs. Let's hurry!
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!
Move your fucking asses.
Squad Number One, what's the status on the apartment?
Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.
You got it.
What? Two hundred men can't find one man and a girl?
Did you find the girl?
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here-
You're from the 3rd Precinct?
Let's open up his sleeve a little bit.
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.
You're all right.
Sit tight.
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!
Clear the way, men.
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.
Stansfield?
At your service.
This is from...
Mathilda.
Shit.
Get out of here!
Leon asked me to help you out... if something happened, and I think something happened.
He put aside a little cash for you.
So what I'm suggesting is that... seeing as how you're still so young...
I should hold the money for you until you're older.
Like a bank, you know, except... it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.
No one knocks off old Tony.
But it's your money.
In the meantime... all you gotta do is come here every once in awhile... and I'll dish it out so you can have a little fun.
Here.
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?
A job?
What the hell can you do?
I can clean.
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid... so get it out of your goddamn head!
It's over!
The game's over!
Leon's dead!
You hear me?
Come on. You think
I ain't hurting too?
But he's dead.
You're gonna forget all this craziness and get your little ass back to school.
Now take this money and get the hell outta here.
Don't let me see your face till next month...
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.
My parents... died... in a car accident four weeks ago.
It was terrible.
We didn't have the time to get to know one another when you first came here... but I want you to know I'm not the kind of woman who'd let down a child... whatever her situation, whatever her mistake.
So I'm going to help you and do my best to welcome you here again.
But on one condition:
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.
I want you to take a chance... and trust me.
Tell me what happened to you.
My family got shot down by D. E. A. officers... because of a drug problem.
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.
He was a hit man, the best in town, but he died this morning.
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.

You never did eat your lunch, did you?
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.
Why don't you call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?
Friday anyway, and hot.
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?
Well, we could laze around here a while longer.
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time is up...
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend an occasional night in a cheap hotel.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.
For meeting you in secret so we can be secretive.
You come down here on business trips, and we steal lunch hours.
I wish you wouldn't even come.
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?
Oh, I have to go, Sam.
- I can come down next week.
- No.
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.
But respectably.
In my house, with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three.
And after the steak, do we send sister to the movies, turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam!
All right.
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.
And under any circumstances, even respectability.
You make respectability sound disrespectful.
Oh, no, I'm all for it.
It requires patience, temperance, a lot of sweating out.
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.
But if I can see you and touch you, even as simply as this, I won't mind.
I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there.
I sweat to pay off my father's debts, and he's in his grave.
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too.
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and my debts will be paid off.
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.
Oh, Sam, let's get married.
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale?
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.
When I send my ex-wife her alimony, you can lick the stamps.
I'll lick the stamps.
Marion, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself somebody available?
I'm thinking of it.
How could you even think a thing like that?
- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.
Is Mr Lowery back from lunch?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property.
You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions, you forget them as soon as they stop hurting.
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.
My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding.
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilisers.
Any calls?
Teddy called me.
My mother called to see if Teddy called.
Oh, your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
It's as hot as fresh milk.
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss to air condition you up.
He can afford it today.
Marion, will you get the copies of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.
Oh, not you. My daughter.
A baby.
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self up there and gets married away from me.
I want you to take a look at my baby.
Eighteen years old and she never had an unhappy day in any one of those years.
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?
I buy it off.
Are... Are you unhappy?
Not inordinately.
I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present.
$40,000 cash.
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.
- Count them!
- I declare!
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.
Tom, a cash transaction of this size is most irregular.
So what? It's my private money.
Now it's yours.
Suppose we put it in the safe, and then Monday morning when you're feeling good...
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's that bottle you said was in your desk?
You know, sometimes I can keep my mouth shut.
Lowery, I am dying of thirst-aroonie.
I don't even want it in the office over the weekend.
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank, and we'll get him to give us a cheque on Monday instead.
Yes.
He was flirting with you.
I guess he must've noticed my wedding ring.
Come in.
The copies. Mr Lowery, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.
Because me and your boss are going out and get ourselves a little drinking done. Right?
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas, the playground of the world.
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank and then go home and sleep it off.
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.
What is it, Marion?
Hold it there.
In quite a hurry.
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.
I almost had an accident last night from sleepiness,
- so I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...
I mean, just to be safe.
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Am I acting as if there's something wrong?
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?
I've told you there's nothing wrong, except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time.
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.
May I see your licence?
- Why?
- Please.
Be with you in a second!
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?
There's an old saying. "The first customer of the day is always the most trouble."
But like I say,
I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square that you won't have one human reason...
Can I trade my car in and take another?
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.
Why don't you have a look around here and see if there's something that strikes your eyes.
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic give yours the once-over.
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.
I'm in a hurry and I just wanna make a change.
One thing people never ought to be when they're buying used cars and that's in a hurry.
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.
That's the one I'd have picked for you myself.
- How much?
- Go ahead.
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.
How much would it be with my car?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?
Of course not. Please.
Well, it's the first time the customer ever high-pressured the salesman.
I figure roughly your car plus $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?
All right.
I take it you can prove that car is yours.
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?
In the building.
Over there.
I think you better take it for a trial spin.
I don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...
I might as well be perfectly honest with you, ma'am.
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?
Is there anything so terribly wrong about making a decision and wanting to hurry?
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.
All right, let's go inside.
Hey!
Just put it in here, please.
Thank you.
Heck, Officer,
that was the first time
I ever saw the customer
high-pressure the salesman.
Somebody chasing her?
I better have a look at those papers, Charlie.
She look like a wrong one to you?
Acted like one.
The only funny thing, she paid me $700 in cash.
- Yes, Mr Lowery.
- Caroline, Marion still isn't in?
No, Mr Lowery, but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.
I called her sister, Mr Lowery, where she works,
the Music Makers Music Store, you know,
and she doesn't know where Marion is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house.
She may be, well, unable to answer the phone.
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.
No, I haven't the faintest idea.
As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday.
She said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early, and I said she could.
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.
I did see her some time later, driving...
I think you'd better come over here to my office, quick.
Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.
After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!
I'm not taking the responsibility.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
A girl works for you for 10 years, you trust her.
All right, yes, you better come over.
Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!
I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.
I still can't believe...
It must be some kind of a mystery. I can't...
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?
You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you in all this rain.
Go ahead in, please.
- Dirty night.
- You have a vacancy?
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.
They... They moved away the highway.
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.
I knew you must have.
Nobody ever stops here any more unless they've done that.
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.
We just keep on lighting the lights and following the formalities.
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.
Los Angeles.
Cabin One. It's closer in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.
I want sleep more than anything else, except maybe food.
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles up the road, just outside of Fairvale.
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Boy, it's stuffy in here.
Well, the mattress is soft and there's hangers in the closet and stationery with Bates Motel printed on it in case you wanna make your friends back home feel envious.
And the...
- Over there.
- The bathroom.
Yeah.
Well, if you want anything, just tap on the wall.
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.
Norman Bates.
You're not really gonna go out again and drive up to the diner, are you?
No.
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.
You know, nothing special, just sandwiches and milk.
But I'd like it very much if you'd come up to the house.
I don't set a fancy table, but the kitchen's awful homey.
- I'd like to.
- All right.
You get yourself settled and take off your wet shoes, and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
Okay.
With my... With my trusty umbrella.
No! I tell you no!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper!
By candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap, erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, please.
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.
"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...
I refuse to speak of disgusting things, because they disgust me!
You understand, boy? Go on.
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food or my son!
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.
Mother... My mother...
What is the phrase?
She isn't quite herself today.
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wish you could apologise for other people.
Don't worry about it.
But as long as you've fixed a supper, we may as well eat it.
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.
Well, it stopped raining.
Eating in an office is just too officious.
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
You're very kind.
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.
You... You eat like a bird.
And you'd know, of course.
No, not really.
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird" is really a false... Falsity.
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.
But I don't really know anything about birds.
My hobby is stuffing things.
You know, taxidermy.
And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because
I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed.
You know, foxes and chimps.
Some people even stuff dogs and cats, but, oh, I can't do that.
I think only birds look well stuffed because...
Well, because they're kind of passive to begin with.
It's a strange hobby. Curious.
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.
The chemicals are the only thing that cost anything.
A man should have a hobby.
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.
A hobby's supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Is your time so empty?
No.
Well, I run the office and tend the cabins and grounds and do little errands for my mother.
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.
Do you go out with friends?
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.
You've never had an empty moment in your entire life, have you?
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?
I didn't mean to pry.
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.
People never run away from anything.
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?
I think that we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out.
We scratch and claw, but only at the air, only at each other.
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.
You know, if anyone ever talked to me the way I heard, the way she spoke to you...
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,
I feel I'd like to go up there and curse her and leave her forever.
Or at least defy her.
But I know I can't.
She's ill.
She sounded strong.
No, I mean ill.
She had to raise me all by herself, after my father died.
I was only five and it must've been quite a strain for her.
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or anything like that.
He left her a little money.
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.
And he talked her into building this motel.
He could have talked her into anything.
And when he died, too, it was just too great a shock for her.
And the way he died...
I guess it's nothing to talk about while you're eating.
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.
Except you.
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?
She'd be alone up there.
Her fire would go out.
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.
If you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them.
You understand, I don't hate her.
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her someplace...
You mean an institution? A madhouse?
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?
Put her in someplace.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.
What do you know about caring?
Have you ever seen the inside of one of those places?
The laughing and the tears and the cruel eyes studying you.
My mother there?
But she's harmless.
She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.
I am sorry.
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.
They cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest, oh, so very delicately.
Of course, I've suggested it myself.
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.
It's not as if she were a maniac, a raving thing.
She just goes a little mad sometimes.
We all go a little mad sometimes.
Haven't you?
Yes.
Sometimes just one time can be enough.
Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
Oh, you're not going back to your room already?
I'm very tired.
And I have a long drive tomorrow, all the way back to Phoenix.
Really?
I stepped into a private trap back there and I'd like to go back and try to pull myself out of it before it's too late for me, too.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay just a little while longer?
Just for talk?
Oh, I'd like to, but...
All right.
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.
All right, Miss...
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.
Good night.
No!
No!
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!
Blood! Blood!
I've tried many brands.
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.
Let's see what they say about this one.
They tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate every insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless.
And I say, insect or man, death should always be painless.
I suppose, this one seems to claim more and better qualities than lots of the others.
Sam?
Sam! Lady wants to see you.
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.
Something wrong?
She left home on Friday.
I was in Tucson over the weekend and I haven't heard from her since.
Not even a phone call.
Look, if you two are in this thing together,
I don't care, it's none of my business, but I want to talk to Marion and I want her to tell me it's none of my business and then I'll go...
Bob, run out and get yourself some lunch, will you?
- That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.
Now, what thing could we be in together?
Sorry about the tears.
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?
Who are you, friend?
My name is Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.
What's your interest in this?
Well, $40,000.
- That's right.
Well, one of you'd better tell me what's going on, and tell me fast.
- I can take just so much of this...
- Now, take it easy, friend.
Take it easy.
It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.
What are you talking about?
What is this?
She was supposed to bank it on Friday for her boss and she didn't.
- And no one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back.
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?
Did you come up here on just a hunch and nothing more?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you believe me or not.
All I want to do is see Marion before she gets in this too deeply.
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.
No, she was seen leaving town in her own car, by her employer, I might add.
I can't believe it. Can you?
Well, you know, we're always quickest to doubt people who have a reputation for being honest.
I think she's here, Miss Crane.
Where there's a boyfriend...
Well, she's not back there with the nuts and bolts, but she's here, in this town somewhere.
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.
- Evening.
- Evening.
I almost drove right past.
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?
No, thanks.
Last two days, I've been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon, but, you know, this is the first place that looks like it's hiding from the world.
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.
Just doesn't seem like any use any more, you know.
See, that used to be the main highway right there.
Well, wanna come in and register?
No, no, sit down.
I don't wanna trouble you.
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.
I always change the beds here once a week whether they've been used or not.
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a...
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.
You out to buy a motel?
No.
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...
What... What was it you wanted to ask?
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.
I've been trying to trace a girl that's been missing for, oh, about a week now from Phoenix.
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.
I didn't think the police went looking for people who aren't in trouble.
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.
We have reason to believe that she came along this way.
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?
Well, no one's stopped here for a couple of weeks.
Would you mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Commit myself?
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.
- Sure?
- Yeah.
Well, she may have used an alias.
Marion Crane's her real name, but she could've registered under a different one.
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother with guests registering any more.
You know, one by one, you drop the formalities.
I shouldn't even bother changing the sheets, but old habits die hard.
Which reminds me...
- What's that?
- It's the light. The sign.
We had a couple last week, said if the thing hadn't been on, they would've thought this was an old, deserted...
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.
You said that nobody'd been here for a couple weeks, and there's a couple came by and didn't know that you were open.
Yeah.
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.
It's possible, this girl could've registered under another name.
Do you mind if I look at your book?
- No.
- Thank you.
All right.
I'll get the date somewhere.
See, there's nobody.
Let's see now, I have a sample of her handwriting here.
Oh, yes.
Here we are.
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Marie, Marion.
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.
You know, it's tough keeping track of the time around here.
Oh, I know, I know.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it was raining and her hair was all wet.
I tell you, it's not really a very good picture of her either.
No, I guess not.
Tell me all about her.
Well, she arrived rather late one night, and she went straight to sleep and left early the next morning.
- How early?
- Oh, very early.
Which morning was that?
The...
- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.
Locally?
Did you spend the night with her?
No.
Well then, how would you know that she didn't make any phone calls?
Well, she was very tired and...
See, now I'm starting to remember.
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.
You know, if you make a mental picturisation of something...
That's right. That's right.
Take your time.
She was... She was sitting back there...
No, no, she was standing back there with a sandwich in her hand and she said she had to go to sleep early because she had a long drive ahead of her.
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.
No, you said before that she was sitting back there... Standing back there...
Yes, back in my parlour there.
She was very hungry and I made her a sandwich and then she said that she was tired and she had to go right to bed.
I see. How did she pay you?
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.
Cash, huh?
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?
Yeah.
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.
Well, I don't know what you could expect me to know.
People just come and go, you know.
- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12 of them,
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on with me.
You can help me change beds.
- Okay?
- No, thanks.
Change your mind?
You know, I... I think I must have one of those faces you just can't help believing.
- Is anyone at home?
- No.
Oh? There's somebody sitting up in the window.
- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.
Oh, that must be my mother.
She's an invalid.
It's practically like living alone.
Oh, I see.
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here, you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?
No.
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument, that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.
You'd know that you were being used.
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...
And I'm not capable of being fooled, not even by a woman.
- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?
No. As I told you, she's confined.
Yes, but just for a few minutes.
That's all.
There might be some hint that you missed out on.
You know, sick old women are usually pretty sharp.
- Mr Arbogast... I think I've...
- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.
- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...
I think it'd be much better if you left now. Thanks.
Well, all right.
You sure would save me a lot of leg work if you'd let me talk to her.
- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.
All right. Thanks anyway.
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.
Hello, Lila.
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.
Yes, she spent last Saturday night at the Bates Motel.
It's right out here on the old highway.
I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.
Well, this young fella that runs the place said that she just spent the night, left the next day and that was it.
No, not exactly.
Well, I did question him, believe me, but I think I got all there was to get.
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied...
See, this boy had a sick old mother.
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.
No. No, unfortunately, he wouldn't let me see her.
Well, I was, but I think
I'll go back to the motel first.
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.
All right, fine. Listen, I...
You'll be happy to know what I think.
I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't know that Marion was here.
Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.
All right, bye-bye.
Bates?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound.
Ever notice that, Lila?
Sam, he said an hour or less.
Yeah.
- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?
He'll be back.
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!
- That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
- Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...
An hour, or less.
- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?
I don't know. One of us has to be here, in case he's on the way.
What am I supposed to do, just sit here and wait?
Yeah. Stay here.
Arbogast?
Arbogast!
Arbogast!
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.
Sick old lady unable to answer the door, or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.
Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything at all?
Yes, I think he would've.
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- All right. Let me get my coat.
Good evening.
Well, I don't know where to start, except at the beginning.
Yes.
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?
She's been here searching for her sister.
There's this private detective helping and...
Well, we got a call from this detective saying that he'd traced her to that motel out on the old highway.
That must be the Bates Motel.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs Bates.
Norman took a wife?
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.
Now, your sister's missing how long?
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday, without a trace.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.
She's not missing so much as she's run away.
- That's right.
- From what?
- She stole some money.
- A lot?
And the police haven't been able to...
Everyone concerned thought if they could get her to give the money back, they could avoid involving her with the police.
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.
What exactly did he say when he called you?
Well, he said that Marion was there for one night and then she left.
With the $40,000?
Well, he didn't say anything about the money.
It isn't important what he said on the phone, is it?
He was supposed to come back here and talk to us after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.
That's what I want you to do something about.
Like what?
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.
It's just that I'm sure there's something wrong out there and I have to know what.
Well, I think there's something wrong too, miss, but not the same thing.
I think what's wrong is your private detective.
I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going, probably from Norman Bates, and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied and he was going back there.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened?
At this hour?
Well, he was out when I was there just a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't even in bed yet.
He wasn't out when you were there, he just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night, like some people do.
This fellow lives like a hermit.
You must remember that bad business out there about 10 years ago.
Please. Call.
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel.
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.
Yeah, have you had a fella stop by there tonight...
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway.
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.
Arbogast.
And after he left?
No, that's okay, Norman.
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl, the detective thanked him and he went away.
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?
Your detective told you he couldn't come right back because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?
Yes.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Green Lawn Cemetery for the past 10 years.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It ain't only local history, Sam.
It's the only case of murder and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy she was involved with when she found out he was married.
Then took a helping of the same stuff herself.
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel!
I called and pounded but she just ignored me!
You want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother?
But it had to be because Arbogast said so, too!
And the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was too ill.
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates, who's that woman buried out in Green Lawn Cemetery?
Now, Mother, I'm gonna bring something up...
I am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders.
Please, Mother.
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.
You think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.
This is my room and no one will drag me out of it, least of all my big, bold son.
They'll come now, Mother.
He came after the girl, and now someone will come after him.
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.
Just for a few days so they won't find you.
Just for a few days?
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!
You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again, not ever again!
Now get out!
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.
Norman, what do you think you're doing?
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd drive out to that motel with you.
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.
- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.
Well, what did he say about my sister?
Just what he told your detective, she used a fake name.
Saw the register myself.
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.
I know you're not the seeing-illusions type, but no woman was there and I don't believe in ghosts,
- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...
Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.
You want to come around to my office this afternoon and report a missing person and a theft, that's what you want to do.
The sooner you drop this in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you stand a chance of your sister being picked up.
How about that?
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.
Come on over to the house and do your reporting around dinnertime.
It'll make it nicer.
- You too, Sam.
- Thank you.
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.
Well, you want me to drop you at the hotel or...
Sam.
I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.
Neither will I. Come on.
We better decide what we're gonna say or do when we walk in there.
We're going to register as man and wife.
We're going to get shown to a cabin, and then we're going to search every inch of the place, inside and out.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting.
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.
Come on.
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.
Suppose you want a room.
We were gonna try to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky.
- Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
- Okay.
- I'll take you to Cabin 10.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?
No. That's not necessary.
My boss is paying for this trip and, well, it's 90% business.
He wants practically notarised receipts.
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.
Thank you.
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.
You check in any other place in this country without bags and you have to pay in advance.
That receipt.
I'll go on ahead.
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.
Sam, we have to go into that cabin and search it, no matter what we're afraid of finding or how much it may hurt.
I know.
Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
I don't know.
But if you had a useless business like this motel, what would you need to get out?
To get a new business somewhere else?
How could we prove that...
Well, if he opens a motel on the new highway in, say, a year...
There must be some proof that exists now, something that proves he got that money away from Marion somehow.
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.
Or he felt sorry for me and he was beginning to feel the same way about you.
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us, unless he was stopped.
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.
We'll start with Cabin One.
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.
Bates.
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!
- Look!
- What is it?
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.
Some figure has been added to or subtracted from 40,000.
That proves Marion was here.
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out about the money?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
No.
But that old woman, whoever she is, she told Arbogast something.
I want her to tell us the same thing.
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.
One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the old woman.
You'll never be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held.
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.
All right, I'll find Bates and keep him occupied.
Wait a minute.
If you get anything out of the mother, can you find your way back to town?
Yes, of course.
If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.
Wife's taking a nap and I never can keep quiet enough for her, so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I thought it was the people who were alone most of the time who did all the talking when they got the chance.
Here you are doing all the listening.
You are alone here, aren't you?
Drive me crazy.
I think that would be a rather extreme reaction, don't you?
Just an expression.
What I meant was I'd do just about anything to get away.
- Wouldn't you?
- No.
Mrs Bates?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here,
I'm just doubting that you are.
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under, you'd unload this place.
This place?
This place happens to be my only world.
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.
My mother and I were more than happy.
You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother, about your motel.
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?
Buy a new one in a new town where you won't have to hide your mother.
Why don't you just get in your car and drive away from here, okay?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates?
Or do you already have it socked away?
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. $40,000.
I bet your mother knows where the money is and what you did to get it.
I think she'll tell us.
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?
Mrs Bates...
I'm Norma Bates!
If anyone gets any answers it'll be the psychiatrist.
Even I couldn't get to Norman and he knows me.
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.
Did he talk to you?
No.
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.
Norman Bates no longer exists.
He only half-existed to begin with.
And now the other half has taken over, probably for all time.
Did he kill my sister?
Yes. And no.
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay some psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea, this fellow would like to cop...
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.
He merely tries to explain it.
- But my sister is...
- Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator, too.
If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...
Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.
Now, to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the mother, that is, from the mother half of Norman's mind, you have to go back 10 years to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died.
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman, and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world.
Then she met a man, and it seemed to Norman that she threw him over for this man.
Now, that pushed him over the line and he killed them both.
Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all, most unbearable to the son who commits it.
So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.
He stole her corpse.
A weighted coffin was buried.
He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep.
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
So he began to think and speak for her, give her half his life, so to speak.
At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations.
At other times, the mother half took over completely.
He was never all Norman, but he was often only Mother, and because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed that she was as jealous of him.
Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.
When he met your sister, he was touched by her, aroused by her.
He wanted her.
That set off the jealous mother, and Mother killed the girl.
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep, and, like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed!
Why was he dressed like that?
He's a transvestite.
Not exactly.
A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change or satisfaction is a transvestite.
But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive.
And when reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he bought.
He'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice.
He tried to be his mother.
And now he is.
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.
You see, when the mind houses two personalities, there's always a conflict, a battle.
In Norman's case, the battle is over, and the dominant personality has won.
And the $40,000? Who got that?
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?
- Oh, sure.
- All right.
Thank you.
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words
that condemn her own son,
but I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.
They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago.
He was always bad,
and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,
as if I could do anything except just sit and stare,
like one of his stuffed birds.
They know I can't even move a finger, and I won't.
I'll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do suspect me.
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.
Let them see what kind of a person I am.
I'm not even gonna swat that fly.
I hope they are watching. They'll see.
They'll see and they'll know,
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was...
...is lost.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves.
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
And nine...
...nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...
... who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...
... to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...
...and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...
... the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...
...could not be undone.
It was in this moment...
... when all hope had faded...
... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...
...are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur...
... to his death.
And some things that should not have been forgotten...
... were lost.
History became legend...
...legend became myth.
And for two and a half thousand years...
... the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...
...it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...
... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own. My love. My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...
... whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...
...its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
What's this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
The 22nd day of September...
...in the year 1 400...
...by Shire-reckoning.
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...
...the Shire...
...Middle-earth.
The Third Age of this world.
There and Back Again.
A Hobbit's Tale.
By Bilbo Baggins.
Now...
...where to begin?
Ah, yes....
''Concerning...
...Hobbits.''
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire...
...for many hundreds of years...
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...
...by the world of the Big Folk.
Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count...
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...
...being neither renowned as great warriors...
...nor counted among the very wise.
Frodo! Someone at the door.
In fact, it has been remarked by some...
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
A rather unfair observation...
...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales...
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.
But where our hearts truly lie...
...is in peace and quiet...
...and good, tilled earth.
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.
But today of all days, it is brought home to me.
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
Frodo, the door!
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?
Frodo!
Down from the door where it began
And I must follow if I can
The road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the road has gone
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
How is the old rascal?
I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
Half the Shire's been invited.
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
And so life in the Shire goes on...
... very much as it has this past Age...
...full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.
If it comes at all.
For things are made to endure in the Shire...
...passing from one generation to the next.
There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill...
...in Bag End.
And there always will be.
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.
I mean, more than usual.
He's taken to locking himself in his study.
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
Where's it gone?
He's up to something.
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?
But I know you have something to do with it.
Good gracious me.
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf! Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you. 1 1 1 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven't aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1 296.
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime last week.
Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.
I've just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs if you'd--
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
I'm not at home!
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.
They've never forgiven me for living this long.
I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day...
...never giving me a moment's peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won't you?
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.
I know.
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...
...like butter scraped over too much bread.
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.
And I don't expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.
Gandalf, my old friend...
...this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Go on!
So there I was...
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...
...about how they were going to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...
...that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...
...and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Up they go!
No, the big one.
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Are all these children yours?
Good gracious, you have been productive.
Bilbo?
Sackville-Bagginses!
Quickly, hide!
Thank you, my boy.
You're a good lad, Frodo.
I'm very selfish, you know.
Yes, I am. Very selfish.
I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died...
...but it wasn't out of charity.
I think it was because...
...of all my numerous relations...
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?
No.
Well, yes, but that's not the point.
The point is, Frodo...
...you'll be all right.
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!
This was your idea.
Bilbo.
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might've known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...
...Tooks and Brandybucks...
...Grubbs, Chubbs...
...Hornblowers...
...Bolgers...
...Bracegirdles...
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!
Today is my 1 1 1th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among...
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I've put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I'm going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
No. Wait, it's...
...here in my pocket.
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!
It's mine.
My own.
-My precious.
-Precious?
It's been called that before, but not by you.
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I'm trying to help you.
All your long years, we've been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You're right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It's late. The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.
I've thought up an ending for my book:
''And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.''
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
The road goes ever on and on
Until our next meeting.
It's mine. My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
Bilbo!
Bilbo!
My precious.
Precious.
He's gone, hasn't he?
He talked for so long about leaving...
...I didn't think he'd really do it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo's ring.
He's gone to stay with the Elves.
He's left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
''The year 3434 of the Second Age.
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...
...and the finding of the Ring of Power. ''
''It has come to me.
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate...
...for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.
It is precious to me...
... though I buy it with great pain.
The markings upon the band begin to fade.
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.
A secret now that only fire can tell. ''
Shire.
Baggins.
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow
But there still be
Many miles to go
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain
Better than rain or rippling brook
Is a mug of beer inside this Took
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.
War is brewing.
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is.
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.
And proud of it.
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Cheers.
It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.
Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.
-Good night, lads.
-Good night.
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.
Mind who you're sweet-talking.
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
Does she?
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.
Is it secret? Is it safe?
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It's quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor!
In the common tongue, it says:
''One Ring to rule them all...
...One Ring to find them...
...One Ring to bring them all...
...and in the darkness bind them.''
This is the One Ring...
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It's heard its master's call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else...
...to return to the hand of its master.
They are one...
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo...
...he must never find it.
All right.
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it's here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don't know how long they tortured him.
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.
Shire!
Baggins!
Shire.
Baggins. But that would lead them here!
Who goes there?
Take it, Gandalf!
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo...
...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.
No, it can't.
What must I do?
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.
Bree.
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.
I don't have any answers.
I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.
He'll know what to do.
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is not safe outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
And yet, after a hundred years...
...they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!
Nothing important.
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I've thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on...
...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
Always remember, Frodo...
...the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step...
...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
-''It's a dangerous business, Frodo.''
-''Going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet...
... there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. ''
Sam.
Wood-elves.
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.
To the Grey Havens.
They're leaving Middle-earth.
Never to return.
I don't know why...
...it makes me sad.
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.
Just shut your eyes...
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.
Me neither, Sam.
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...
...seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come, is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years, it was in the Shire.
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form...
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantyr is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.
We do not know who else may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...
...disguised as riders in black.
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor...
...there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me...
...friend...
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance...
...of aiding me willingly...
...but you have elected the way of pain!
Mr. Frodo?
Frodo? Frodo!
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?
''Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
Frodo.
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
Come on, Frodo.
What's the meaning of this?
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...
...he's clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I've broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.
-Short cut to what?
-Mushrooms!
That's mine.
That's nice, Merry.
Here's a nice one, Sam.
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.
Frodo?
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.
Run!
This way! Follow me!
Run!
Get the rope, Sam!
Frodo!
Run, Frodo!
Go!
-Hurry!
Frodo, come on!
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.
Come on.
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.
There's talk of strange folk abroad.
Can't be too careful.
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?
If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?
Underhill. My name's Underhill.
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?
Gandalf.
Oh, yes...
...I remember. Elderly chap.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
Sam...
...he'll be here. He'll come.
Get out of my way!
What's that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
That Man in the corner. Who is he?
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.
Strider.
Baggins.
Baggins.
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.
He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side...
...and my third cousin, twice removed....
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
There is no life...
...in the void.
Only...
...death.
You draw far too much attention to yourself, ''Mr. Underhill.''
What do you want?
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.
I can avoid being seen if I wish...
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the Nazgûl.
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel...
... the presence of the Ring...
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...
-...and feel fouler.
-He's foul enough.
We have no choice but to trust him.
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.
We're going to see the Elves.
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.
What about second breakfast?
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.
Pippin!
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?
Who is she?
This woman you sing of.
'Tis the lady of Lûthien.
The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.
What happened to her?
She died.
Get some sleep, Frodo.
The power of Isengard is at your command...
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I'm going to have a look around.
Stay here.
My tomato's burst.
Could I have some bacon?
Want a tomato, Sam?
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
Frodo!
Oh, Sam.
Strider!
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
Gandalf!
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.
Is he going to die?
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
Frodo.
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.
Hear my voice...
Come back to the light.
Who is she?
Frodo.
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.
He's not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him
The Road is too dangerous.
What are they saying?
If I can get across the river...
...the power of my people will protect him.
I do not fear them.
Arwen...
...ride hard. Don't look back.
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
No. No!
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don't give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me...
...let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.
And it is 1 0:00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.
And you're lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring...
...or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one Lord of the Ring.
Only one who can bend it to his will.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
Gandalf? What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
Frodo!
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Bilbo.
''There and Back Again.
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...
...visit Lake-town...
...see the Lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.
Off with you, on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
I'm not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?
No harm in being prepared.
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.
-More than anything.
-I did.
It's just....
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought...
...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.
Off home.
You are right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf...
...the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Nûmenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago...
... when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...
... where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
-Destroy it!
-No.
Isildur!
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There's no strength left in the world of Men.
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
You are no Elf.
Men of the South are welcome here.
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
Then we are here on common purpose...
...friend.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.
It's still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.
Not over you... not over me.
Do you remember when we first met?
I thought I had strayed into a dream.
Long years have passed.
You did not have the cares you carry now.
Do you remember what I told you?
You said you'd bind yourself to me...
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share one lifetime with you...
...than face all the Ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...
...like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...
...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
In a dream...
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...
...but in the West a pale light lingered.
A voice was crying:
''Your doom is near at hand.
Isildur's Bane is found.''
Isildur's Bane.
Boromir!
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...
...may yet be heard...
...in every corner of the West!
The Ring is altogether evil.
It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...
...are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn.
This is Isildur's heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Sit down, Legolas.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin...
...by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor...
...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you...
...must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.
It is a barren wasteland...
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 1 0,000 men could you do this. It is folly.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though...
...I do not know the way.
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...
...as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life or death I can protect you...
...I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates of us all, little one.
If this is indeed the will of the Council...
...then Gondor will see it done.
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...
...even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
We're coming too!
You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of...
...mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
She wanted to protect her child... she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.
In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.
That you'd never escape your fate.
The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings...
...but only you have the power to wield it.
I do not want that power.
I have never wanted it.
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.
My old sword! Sting.
Here, take it. Take it.
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.
And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
Here's a pretty thing.
Mithril.
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
Let me see you put it on. Come on.
My old ring.
I should very much like...
...to hold it again, one last time.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
I'm sorry for everything.
The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.
On you who travel with him, no oath...
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.
May the blessings of Elves and Men...
...and all Free Folk go with you.
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
Left.
We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.
Move your feet.
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.
Faster!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not...
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.
Sorry!
Get him!
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!
Gentlemen, that's enough.
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.
It's moving fast.
Against the wind.
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!
-Hurry!
-Take cover!
Spies of Saruman.
The passage south is being watched.
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
Frodo!
Boromir.
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt...
...over so small a thing.
Such a little thing.
Boromir!
Give the Ring to Frodo.
As you wish.
I care not.
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.
And if that fails, where then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you...
... will you risk a more dangerous road?
There is a fell voice on the air.
It's Saruman!
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!
No!
We must get off the mountain!
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm.
Shadow and flame.
Let the Ring-bearer decide.
We cannot stay here!
This will be the death of the Hobbits.
Frodo?
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
Frodo, come and help an old man.
How is your shoulder?
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?
You feel its power growing, don't you?
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.
And, I fear, from within.
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.
Trust your own strengths.
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...
...for good or for evil.
Some are greater than I am.
And against some I have not yet been tested.
The walls...
...of Moria.
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, let's see.
Ithildin.
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
It reads, ''The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.
-Speak, friend, and enter.''
-What do you suppose that means?
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.
Nothing's happening.
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves...
...Men and Orcs.
What are you going to do, then?
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!
And if that does not shatter them...
...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions...
...I will try to find the opening words.
Mines are no place for a pony.
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.
Go on, Bill. Go on.
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.
Do not disturb the water.
Oh, it's useless.
It's a riddle.
''Speak 'friend' and enter.''
What's the Elvish word for ''friend''?
Mellon.
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.
And they call it a mine.
A mine!
This is no mine. It's a tomb.
No....
No!
Goblins.
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.
Now, get out of here. Get out!
-Frodo!
-Help!
Strider!
-Help!
-Get off him!
Aragorn!
Frodo!
Into the mines!
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!
Run!
We now have but one choice.
We must face the long dark of Moria.
Be on your guard.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...
...in the deep places of the world.
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...
...or jewels...
...but mithril.
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.
I never told him...
...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.
Pippin.
I have no memory of this place.
-Are we lost?
-No.
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.
-Merry?
-What?
I'm hungry.
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...
...or was set loose.
Now the Ring has brought him here.
He will never be rid of his need for it.
He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
Sméagol's life is a sad story.
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.
Before it drove him mad.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity?
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill...
...before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
In which case, you also were meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought.
It's that way.
-He's remembered.
-No.
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
Let me risk a little more light.
Behold...
...the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.
Gimli!
No!
Oh, no.
No.
''Here lies Balin...
...son of Fundin...
...Lord of Moria.''
He is dead, then.
It's as I feared.
We must move on. We cannot linger.
''They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
We have barred the gates...
...but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes.
Drums...
...drums in the deep.
We cannot get out.
A Shadow moves in the dark.
We cannot get out.
They are coming.''
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.
Frodo!
Orcs.
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!
They have a cave-troll.
Let them come!
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
Frodo!
Aragorn! Aragorn!
Frodo!
Frodo!
Oh, no.
He's alive.
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.
You should be dead.
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
Mithril.
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!
This way!
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog.
A demon of the ancient world.
This foe is beyond any of you.
Run!
Quickly!
Gandalf.
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is near.
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.
Gandalf!
Merry! Pippin!
Sam!
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.
Not the beard!
Steady.
Hold on!
Hang on!
Lean forward!
Steady.
Come on!
Now!
Over the bridge!
Fly!
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
Go back to the Shadow.
You shall not pass!
-No! No!
-Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Aragorn!
Legolas, get them up.
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.
On your feet, Sam.
Frodo?
Frodo!
Stay close, young Hobbits!
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.
An Elf-witch...
...of terrible power.
All who look upon her...
...fall under her spell.
Frodo!
And are never seen again.
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.
Mr. Frodo?
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.
Aragorn of the Dunedain... you are known to us.
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!
Speak words we can all understand!
We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?
That was not so courteous.
You bring great evil with you.
You can go no further.
Gandalf's death was not in vain.
Nor would he have you give up hope.
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.
Don't carry the weight of the dead.
You will follow me.
Caras Galadhon.
The heart of Elvendom on earth.
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.
The enemy knows you have entered here.
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.
Tell me, where is Gandalf?
For I much desire to speak with him.
I can no longer see him from afar.
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.
He has fallen into Shadow.
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.
A Balrog of Morgoth.
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.
We do not yet know his full purpose.
Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...
...Gimli, son of Glóin.
For the world has grown full of peril...
...and in all lands...
...love is now mingled with grief.
What now becomes of this Fellowship?
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
Stray but a little and it will fail...
...to the ruin of all.
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
Tonight, you will sleep....
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...
...one who has seen the Eye!
A lament for Gandalf.
What do they say about him?
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.
There should be a verse about them.
The finest rockets ever seen
They burst in stars of blue and green
Or after thunder, silver showers
Came falling like a rain of flowers
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.
Take some rest.
These borders are well-protected.
I will find no rest here.
I heard her voice inside my head.
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.
She said to me,
''Even now there is hope left.''
But I cannot see it.
It is long since we had any hope.
My father is a noble man.
But his rule is failing...
...and our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelion.
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.
Have you ever been called home...
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
I have seen the White City...
...long ago.
One day, our paths will lead us there.
And the tower guard shall take up the call:
''The Lords of Gondor have returned.''
Will you look into the mirror?
What will I see?
Even the wisest cannot tell.
For the mirror...
...shows many things.
Things that were...
...things that are...
...and some things...
...that have not yet come to pass.
I know what it is you saw.
For it is also in my mind.
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.
He will try to take the Ring.
You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.
If you ask it of me...
... I will give you the One Ring.
You offer it to me freely.
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...
...not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!
Treacherous as the sea!
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!
All shall love me...
...and despair.
I pass the test. I will diminish...
...and go into the West...
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...
...is to be alone.
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.
And I am its keeper.
This task was appointed to you.
And if you do not find a way...
...no one will.
Then I know what I must do.
It's just...
...I'm afraid to do it.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
They were Elves once.
Taken by the Dark Powers...
...tortured and mutilated.
A ruined and terrible form of life.
And now...
...perfected.
My fighting Uruk-hai...
...whom do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.
You will taste Man-flesh!
One of the halflings carries something of great value.
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.
Lembas.
Elvish waybread.
One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
How many did you eat?
Four.
Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.
You are being tracked.
By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
They have already seen service in war.
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.
You will find your courage.
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...
...Elven rope made of hithlain.
Thank you, my lady.
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?
Nothing.
Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time...
...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.
Actually....
There was one thing.
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.
Stupid to ask.
I have nothing greater to give...
...than the gift you already bear.
For her love,
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.
I would have her leave these shores, and be with her people.
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.
That choice is yet before her.
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.
To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil...
...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.
Farewell.
There is much you have yet to do.
We shall not meet again...
Elessar.
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
I give you the light of Eärendil...
...our most beloved star.
May it be a light for you in dark places...
... when all other lights go out.
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
What was her gift?
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.
She gave me three.
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.
But he's too clever a waterman.
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.
But you're not.
I'm here to help you.
I promised Gandalf that I would.
You can't help me, Sam.
Not this time.
Get some sleep.
Minas Tirith is the safer road.
You know that.
From there we can regroup.
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.
Have you so little faith in your own people?
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.
But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.
But you will not see that.
You are afraid!
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.
Scared of who you are, of what you are.
I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.
Frodo.
The Argonath.
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.
My kin.
We cross the lake at nightfall.
Hide the boats and continue on foot.
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.
And after that, it gets even better.
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.
That is our road.
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
Recover my--
-We should leave now.
-No.
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
Something draws near.
I can feel it.
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
Where's Frodo?
None of us should wander alone.
You, least of all.
So much depends on you.
Frodo?
I know why you seek solitude.
You suffer. I see it day by day.
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
There are other ways, Frodo.
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
Warning? Against what?
We're all afraid, Frodo.
But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have...
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.
What chance do you think you have?
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.
And you will beg for death before the end!
You fool!
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.
It should be mine! Give it to me!
-Give it to me!
-No!
-Give it to me!
-No.
I see your mind.
You will take the Ring to Sauron!
You will betray us!
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!
Frodo?
Frodo.
What have I done?
Please, Frodo.
Frodo, I'm sorry!
Frodo?
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?
Stay away!
Frodo!
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?
Would you destroy it?
Aragorn.
Aragorn.
Elessar.
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.
I know.
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.
Go, Frodo!
Run.
Run!
Mr. Frodo!
Find the halfling!
Find the halfling!
Elendil!
Aragorn, go!
Frodo!
Hide here. Quick!
Come on!
What's he doing?
He's leaving.
-No!
-Pippin!
Run, Frodo. Go on!
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!
-Over here!
-This way!
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.
Run!
No.
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.
Frodo. Where is Frodo?
I let Frodo go.
Then you did what I could not.
I tried to take the Ring from him.
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.
I did not see it.
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.
You fought bravely.
You have kept your honor.
Leave it.
It is over.
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...
...and my city to ruin.
I do not know what strength is in my blood...
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...
...nor our people fail.
Our people.
Our people.
I would have followed you, my brother.
My captain.
My king.
Be at peace...
...son of Gondor.
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.
But he will not return.
Frodo!
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times...
...but that is not for them to decide.
All you have to decide...
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.
Frodo, no!
Frodo!
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.
Go back, Sam!
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.
And I'm coming with you!
You can't swim!
Sam!
Sam!
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
A promise:
''Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.
I don't mean to.
Sam.
Come on.
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.
Not if we hold true to each other.
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light.
Let us hunt some Orc.
Yes!
Mordor.
I hope the others find a safer road.
Strider will look after them.
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
Sam...
...I'm glad you are with me.

- You can imagine, auntie.
- What's become of them?
- They were among the first to go.
Really?
Of course.
- What about your husband?
- Adolfo?
You know how he loves Havana.
He's at one of his meetings.
Please, friends, please.
We're making this issue more complicated than it really is.
Justifiably so!
No. I've got to get back to
Camagüey as soon as possible.
This is a clear-cut issue.
If a man dies in Baracoa, he should be buried there.
After all, it's one and the same country.
Look here, Rivero, if I die in Baracoa, no way is anyone going to force me to be buried there.
I'm from Santa Clara, and all my family and friends live there.
Take it easy, friends, cool down.
Exuse me, Benito.
Look here, Rivero,
I agree with Paula.
It's not my fault if
I die in Baracoa.
- I might just be visiting friends.
- Who asked you, anyway?
Friends, don't all speak at once!
Go ahead, Adolfo...
What if... we share the body out among all of us?
Be more specific.
If each provincial company assumes responsibility for its own territory, if we each agree to transport the body across our province, then we all have less to do.
In which case no one will exceed the petrol allowance granted to each undertaker.
Look, Justo, if we carry out a careful, on-the-spot study, adhering to the proper procedures, the plan has to work.
- I totally reject such a wild idea.
- Me too.
It's okay for you, because you're from Guantánamo and there are no other towns in this direction.
But I'm from Santa Clara, smack in the middle of the island.
Every corpse on the island will be stopping off there.
I'm no stepping stone,
Adolfo!
Friends, it's no good just considering our own problems.
We're losing the overall view of the matter.
We have to think patriotically.
This isn't a local tavern.
They may have given
Adolfo the boot but he still seems to be well-connected.
What's the alternative, auntie?
You have to survive somehow.
Are you still unoccupied, Gina?
You've not gone back to teaching?
Back to teaching?
With all the trouble I had at the University?
Here theory and practice are two different things. I'm not going through all that again.
Yes, but there are otherjobs.
You can't stay shut up in the house.
What happened about that radio programme you mentioned?
A youth guidance programme on the radio?
Now?
You've no idea what a problem that would be.
Auntie, you're not going to smoke?
After the lunch we've just had!
Do you want one?
No, besides Adolfo doesn't like me smoking.
But Adolfo is in Havana, my dear!
What became of...?
He always asks after you.
Do you still think about him?
We'll probably bump into him.
I don't know why you're so worked up.
It's been fifty years,
Gina, fifty years.
A lot of things have changed. I don't want him to see me like this.
- Like what, Auntie?
- Come off it, Gina. Like this.
I was seventeen when he last saw me.
He's no eighteen-year-old now, either.
Georgina
Travieso!
Reglita Campoamor!
Hello, Gina.
Small world, isn't it?
Guantánamo is, you mean.
You haven't changed a bit.
Come on in, both of you.
What's new in Havana?
Come in.
Tell me about yourself.
Did you ever get married?
So long ago I hardly remember.
My roots are in this town.
Why, I've never even been to Santiago de Cuba.
You're joking!
- Have you any children?
- Two. A girl and a boy.
- I'd love to meet them.
- Pop round and visit.
It suits you to a T. I'm going to buy you it.
No, Auntie. I never go out anywhere.
Besides, Adolfo doesn't like such low necklines.
CULTURE IS IMMORTAL.
Citizens of Guantámano!
For fifty years, during which her art has been acclaimed in theatres the world over,
Georgina Travieso was not just Georgina Travieso.
For many she was
Cecilia Valdés, or Madame Butterfly, or María la O or Luisa Fernanda...
Look how young you were up on the bandstand!
A mere stripling.
I feel like a naughty girl.
Gina must be looking for me all over.
And that gossip Regla will have a field day tomorrow.
What about this young girl?
I'm sure I've seen her recently.
I can't imagine who it could be.
I must be going a bit soft in the head.
I don't think you were ever quite right in the head.
How young we were then!
Do you know I still have your blue ribbon?
My blue ribbon?
You've forgotten!
Don't you remember, when you left, you promised me you'd return and you gave me your blue hair ribbon as a token?
Now I remember.
You came to see me off.
It was raining buckets...
No, Cándido, it wasn't raining.
I remember it was a gorgeous day.
Yes it was raining.
I've never since seen a sun as beautiful as that morning.
It was so cloudy
I couldn't tell when night fell.
Nightfall?
But it was midday, Cándido.
It was night, I tell you, night.
How could it be night when the train left at 1 p.m.?
Here it is!
I'm like the white swan
which dies singing.
How young we were then!
When I get sentimental, do you know what I do?
I close my eyes and imagine things.
We're by a river bank,
I'm twenty, and you're sixteen.
You look handsome in your blue suit.
Now you're getting the hem of your dress wet in the river.
- Oh, the water's cold!
- You're about to fall and I...
What are you doing?
Mother will see us!
I love you.
I've loved you these fifty years.
Don't open your eyes.
Imagine that not a single day has gone by.
I want us to be together until the end.
When I saw you again,
I almost ran away.
I don't know,
I was scared.
And I felt pain, here, in my jaw.
But now everything is going to be different.
We'll never part again.
Isn't that so?
Yoyita!
... that dies singing...
... dies singing... dies singing...
Adolfo!
What? Yes, this has to run like clockwork... what's up?
Listen, your wife's calling.
My wife?
She says it's urgent.
Excuse me.
Hello, Gina.
What's wrong?
What?
That's impossible.
Can nothing be done?
Yes, darling. I'll leave for the airport right now.
Listen, leave everything to me.
Don't you do anything, do you hear?
Yes, listen, speak to Felo, to Felo.
Tell him to get busy with the formalities.
But don't you do anything.
You take it easy, my love.
Do you hear? Yes...
Aunt Yoyita!
Power cuts here as well?
The route is quite clear, Tony.
We bypass Santiago, go straight to Bayamo, and then on to Las Tunas.
I'll tell you the other stops on the way.
Guantánamo, Bayamo,
Las Tunas.
Okay.
We'll follow the hearse in your "Volga".
The corpse ahead and the uproar behind.
Okay.
Adolfo, Cándido wants to ask you a favour.
Go ahead, Cándido.
Listen, Adolfo, I've got no one left in the world...
He wondered if he could accompany
Aunt Yoyita to Havana with us.
Of course, Cándido.
You're like one of the family.
I'd already allowed for such a contingency and requested a permit for four people.
One moment...
Let's get this ready.
It's all right, it's all right like that.
Right, Adolfo...
Make sure you call Tirso.
Give him the exact departure time.
SOCIALISM OR DEATH.
Cándido is upset
because he has lost
his beloved.
The woman he longed for
has been taken from him
for the second time.
The funeral committee
leaves behind,
the East
and rolls westward
to accomplish its mission.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera...
Puchi, are you romantic?
You bet your balls!
Come on, baby, off you go, I'm in a hurry.
You're acting strange.
You've been acting very strange with me just lately. What's up?
Nothing. I've got to go.
Why?
You promised you'd take me to Havana this time.
It's just that this trip came up unexpectedly.
You already told me that one.
I'm too old for stories.
I've bet all my aces on you.
Look at the time!
I can't go back home now.
- Well, Marilis, that's how it is.
- What do I get out of it? Nothing!
You've used me and now you've got to take me to Havana.
Mariano,
I'm pregnant.
And my husband won't have a baby that's not his.
Is that clear?
He won't stand for it.
Shit, Marilis!
Listen, don't get all worked up. Calm down!
Bloody well calm down.
It's you that's got me into trouble.
Wait, we're going to talk things through.
- I promised to take you to Havana.
- Yes.
Okay, calm down. I'll take you.
We'll sort things out somehow.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Yes.
Wait for me here then. I'll get my things and be back in a flash.
And we'll set off for Havana.
That looks good!
Ramón!
Listen, Ramón!
Lets go.
- Get your stuff, we're off.
- Why? Look at the time.
Come on, mate.
- I'm in real trouble.
- What sort of trouble?
- Have you run somebody over?
- No! I'll explain on the way.
It's over Marilis. All his problems are over women.
- Oh no! Leave me out of it.
- That Marilis has gone crazy.
- I don't believe it...
- Come on, I'll explain on the way.
Come here. Lets load this rice.
O for the day when
I don't have to run off...
Tell her I'm not here.
- Marilis, what a coincidence!
- What a coincidence!
We were just talking about you.
- Just now.
- What kind of coincidence?
Where's Mariano?
He'll be back shortly.
He went to cut a bunch of bananas to take to Havana.
He'd do better to cut some flowers for his funeral because when I catch him,
I'll murder him. No man
- stands me up.
- Mariano was just saying
- we should pick you up.
- Stop protecting him.
You men are all the same.
- Leave Ramón out of it!
- He's another prime example.
You're the slut! You've been laid by all the men in La Maya.
Sour grapes, because you're fat and undesirable. I'm going in.
Over my dead body!
I won't have whores in my house.
How much?
The garlic? A buck or sixty pesos.
A buck, boss.
Interested?
Music Man?
A buck or sixty pesos.
That's half my wage.
- How many have you got?
- Six.
Give me all six.
Here.
They'll cry out for this in Havana.
Make a bit of room.
Hey! Have you got any food?
Food?
Only cigarettes and tobacco.
The 1,650 acres of beans
planted
in the state co-operative
and rural sectors
represent a new
record figure...
You undertakers shouldn't overdo things.
There aren't enough coffins.
... reached 28,
smashing the previous
record of 528 acres
in the winter harvest.
So a new record has been
set in local agriculture.
This is going to be a real success.
Now I'll make a name for myself.
... decisive result in the national
development plan...
Hey, listen, mate.
You're an expert in this witchcraft stuff.
Can't you magic away my problem with women?
You can't solve that with spells, Mariano.
It's simpler than that.
But I'm sick of teaching a reluctant learner.
The fancy women that you always go for think they have rights, and so make demands:
You can't have other women, you have to marry her, and take her to Havana.
We don't need that hassle, mate.
Just imagine if we had those problems in every town we visited.
Take me, I've no problems with my old lady.
But not you.
You have to go for the classy ones.
And to boot, you always have one up your sleeve.
Make your mind up.
Marry one, take her to Havana, be a good husband, do right by her, she's the one who should be first class.
But on the road, a bit on the side never did any harm.
On the road, well, on the road anything goes, plump or skinny.
I've got my old lady in Havana and I keep her warm and happy.
She's the one who'll look after me when I'm old.
That's life, Mariano.
Look what happened to old Manuel.
When he got a bit past it, all those women he had in tow couldn't be seen for dust.
Only someone who really loves you puts up with you when you're old.
No one went to his wake.
They sent his body to the medical school for dissection.
That's the worst thing:
Knowing you're going to die alone, with nobody at your side to close your eyes.
Come on, stop dramatizing!
Do me a favour.
I'm stuck here with the family.
Can you give us a lift?
- Where are you going?
- To Las Tunas.
- Three hundred pesos?
- Whatever you say, friend.
I just want to get out of here.
Up you go, be quick! When
I'm loaded up, this is risky.
Let's hurry!
Get a move on there!
Miss...
- Can you let us jump the queue?
- Sorry, I can't.
Look, we've got a corpse to take to Havana.
Yes, love, I appreciate your problem, but all we've got here is tamarind juice.
- Fine, I'll take five.
- I'm sorry, love, but until the ice arrives,
I can't start selling.
Order two coffees,
I'm going to the toilet.
Two coffees, pal.
I could do with a little water.
The manager, please.
Thanks.
Sorry!
Professor!
Mariano.
- Are you working here?
- No.
Well, yes. That's where I work.
- Didn't you finish University?
- Yes, I did.
I became an engineer.
Well?
You can imagine.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
It's not too hard.
I even earn more.
Good.
- Are you just out for a drive?
- No.
No. We're taking my aunt, to Havana to be buried.
I'm sorry.
You gave up teaching.
No, it's just that we went back to Guantánamo.
But this is a government emergency.
Look, here's the service order.
I'm sorry, young man, but we only take dollars here.
Perhaps further on they can help you.
- Come on.
- Right.
I behaved like a kid.
The last time I saw her,
I slipped a note inside her book, and then I never saw her again.
I never went back to the University.
That must have been... three years ago.
She remembered my name.
Sounds like one of those
TV soap operas.
Don't take offence, mate, but it's true.
I was mad about that woman.
She was your teacher, then?
- What subject?
- Economics.
So she knows how to get out of this mess, right?
Socialist political economics was what she taught me.
But don't get the idea she was dogmatic. Quite the opposite.
Her classes were...
Besides, what she said made you think.
She got into real trouble for it.
Because there was another teacher there who really was obsessive.
She taught scientific communism.
- What?
- Just imagine.
Explain.
Well, she talked about what paradise would be like.
The land of plenty.
Good grief!
Now I believe they call it scientific socialism.
Any day now they'll be calling it scientific capitalism.
That's a good one!
How far are you going, pal?
Bayamo and then Las Tunas.
I have to pick up some goods.
All aboard for Las Tunas!
- Look, nice and ripe.
- How much?
- Only fifty per kilo.
- I'll take a bunch.
No, the price is in dollars.
Fifty bucks a kilo, boss.
Give me some.
There you are.
Thanks.
Have one, Georgina.
- Music Man.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
Your change, friend.
Thank you very much.
Here, Adolfo.
Tony!
Tony!
Would you mind very much turning off the radio?
- Okay, Music Man, sorry.
- Just a minute, Tony.
I only asked if he'd mind turning the music off.
I don't think it's the best moment for celebrating.
Well, I'll be...!
Give 'em an inch and they take a mile.
Adolfo, please!
Okay, Cándido, okay.
I only had the radio on to hear the weather forecast.
I'm upset about Aunt Yoyita, too.
But if everybody starts doing what they feel like, where will it all end?
Okay, no problem.
Turn it off.
During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries,
Bayamo was the most important smuggling centre on the island.
In this way they made a mockery of restrictions and the rigid trade monopoly of the Spanish Crown, which stifled economic growth.
Illegal trade with the
English, French and...
Illegal trade with the
English, French and Dutch was practised by all the locals, including the administrative, military and religious authorities.
Their dealings with the
Protestants, branded as heretics, not only influenced economic growth, but also affected cultural and political life.
Through this channel, the doors were opened for books banned by the Inquisition and the liberal and progressive ideas of the time.
It was no coincidence that Bayamo was the first city to rise in arms against the colonial domination which was stifling the development of the country.
Close it up.
- The toilet?
- At the back on the right.
I'm going to have some coffee made.
There's no snack today.
Adolfo, I've been thinking.
This system costs the same.
The mileage is the same.
But the use of resources is economically fairer, and in accord with the national planning system.
Adolfo, I'm an economist.
Don't you realize, then, that invoicing the critical route guarantees company management at all levels?
Moreover, it makes for a better distribution of the social product, not to mention more efficient statistical records.
You may be an expert economist, but administration has you beat.
What about the sufferers?
The dead don't suffer.
And as for the living...
Okay.
You know best.
Look, Gina.
You know what this could mean for me.
For us.
You know how important appearances are in this country.
Statistics...
Give me a break for once!
Cándido...
Cándido, please, don't take any notice of Adolfo.
He's under a lot of strain.
This relay system was his idea, and he thinks that, if it works, he might win back their confidence.
You know that someone who got as far as he did only to be assigned the job of undertaker...
It's not easy.
- Shall we have a drop of coffee?
- No.
I'll bring you one anyway.
Cándido, your coffee.
Do you not feel well, Cándido?
Let's go outside.
I'll take your coffee.
Let's go out for some fresh air.
Hey, hey!
Be careful!
Watch out!
Idiot!
Hey!
What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
- My wife's in labour.
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, blessed St. Barbara!
- Speak to my boss.
- Not in there, woman!
Not in that car, in this one.
Can you take us to Bayamo?
But we're on our way to Las Tunas.
We've just come from Bayamo.
She can't wait.
Bayamo isn't far.
But this is a funeral, a funeral...!
And they're having a baby.
A birth!
Blessed
St. Barbara. Help!
Hey, Adolfo, it's not the car's fault.
It's okay, calm down.
Adolfo, we're taking her!
Hang on, baby!
Get into the hearse and wait for us in Las Tunas.
Come on! I've got to take this woman. Come on!
Take it easy.
Hang on, baby, hang on!
You're crazy!
- I didn't need a lift to Havana.
- Listen, let me explain.
Because I've found someone forty times the man you are.
Do you hear? I don't need you!
Bastard! Do you hear?
- I don't need you!
- Shit!
- Fucking hell!
- Hey, cut it out!
That'll teach you to have more respect.
To the hospital!
Let's see.
That needs stitching. It looks really bad. Yes, to Bayamo.
I'll unhook the trailer and go back to Bayamo. I'll be back in an hour.
- No...
- I'll be back in an hour!
If you don't like the idea, walk!
Press to stop the bleeding.
S.O.S. Can you hear me? Over.
Patrol here. Identify
yourself. Over.
We have an emergency.
A woman in labour.
This is special service car N°13 from the base in Guantánamo.
From the American naval base
in Guantánamo? Over.
No, from the city of Guantánamo...
From the special service taxi base N°13.
Listen, we're on the Las Tunas-Bayamo road, heading for Bayamo. Over.
I read you.
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
You're bloody joking!
State exact position. Over.
Well, she's in the back seat.
Where? Repeat, please.
Six miles from Bayamo, on the highway. Over.
Don't lose your patience, miss.
Yamilé, she's called Yamilé.
The daughter of Tomás the islander.
We'll send an escort.
Be patient. Over.
- Pant!
- Pant, pant!
Careful with the baby!
Hey, doc!
She looks just like me.
She's just like me, driver.
Thanks, mate.
Hey, Mariano, let's go, okay?
Pardon me for saying so, but it's a relief to be free of your husband.
I'm as honest as I am ugly, and now that we're alone, as the saying goes,
I've a proposition to make.
Up ahead, I've got a friend who runs a "paladar", a clandestine inn.
It's a clean, decent place, and for one peso we can eat a great amarillo with pork.
I've got a few bucks on me, so three can eat as well as one.
Thanks, Tony, but I've got some dollars too.
The problem is, if we're late back,
Adólfo will hit the roof.
If he can wait for important things, he can wait for this.
Adolfo needn't find out.
Besides, he's half an hour ahead of schedule.
He said. So himself.
Believe me,
Adolfo is capable of taking us to Havana on just two bananas.
Come on, Cándido.
In you go.
Paco!
Paco!
- What brings you here, brother?
- Customers.
We need a pork amarillo on the double.
On the double!
Okay. Raulito!
Put a cloth on this table.
Come in.
Get my seat ready.
Here you are.
- How much?
- 25. Genuine article.
Twenty... and a few bananas.
You're like Yoyita.
In name only.
We're both called Georgina.
There's something else,
I don't know but...
You really loved her, didn't you?
She had such a desire to live!
She?
Or you?
Hey, be careful! Go gently!
- Handle it with care!
- It slipped, boss.
Can't you do this some other time?
Don't worry.
This is straighforward.
We'll have the changeover done in ten minutes.
Everything was going fine, but now my plan's gone to pot.
Listen,
Justo rang and I told him you'd left for Camagüey.
Hey, don't get worked up.
You've had problems with your blood pressure already.
Come on, let's have a coffee.
If it hadn't been for that bloody baby...!
Excuse me, I'll wait for you outside.
- You've hardly touched your food.
- Neither have you.
We old people get by on little.
Loneliness is the worst sort of hunger.
Oh, Cándido, you're not alone.
People are really fond of you.
Besides, you've got your memories of Aunt Yoyita.
You know, all my life I've been waiting for a miracle.
I thought that some day I'd get to play in the Symphony Orchestra.
Maybe I was afraid to look fate in the eye. Who knows?
Yoyita became famous, but me...
Stuck in Gantánamo, with my saxhorn!
Oh, Cándido!
Damn it!
Fifty years putting off a trip to Havana!
My life kept getting smaller and smaller my friends started dying, or left the country.
It's always other people who die.
You never think about death until one fine day, there it is, right under your nose.
Are you people coming to eat?
- No, we brought our own food.
- Okay, I'll only be ten minutes.
- How's things?
- Hey, how's things?
- How's business?
- Quiet.
- We'll liven it up for you.
- Come on in.
What happened to you?
Professor!
Mariano!
Cándido, look, it's Mariano.
- Don't get up. How do you do.
- How do you do.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I'm not a professor now, just Gina.
The food's good here, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Do you feel ill?
- No, no...
If you'll excuse me...
I'm just going to the toilet.
What a coincidence!
Meeting three times in the same day after so long without seeing each other!
Yes, it's odd.
Why were you at the hospital?
Nothing...
- Mi colleague had an accident.
- Really?
Yes, we ran into a... a cow in the road.
But it was nothing serious.
He just bumped his forehead.
- Why were you there?
- Another accident.
But different. I was with a girl who gave birth to a lovely daughter.
But, weren't you going to a funeral?
Well, there you are...
Some depart and others arrive.
That's life, right?
Gina, do you still teach?
Don't be so formal.
Do you still teach?
No.
I got tired of hitting my head against a brick wall.
Shame!
But still, you're an intelligent woman with millions of opportunities.
Thanks.
It's not the end of the world, is it?
And in the end, I reckon the brick wall yields.
- Do you think so?
- Yes.
You...
You know that better than anyone.
Do you remember? Everything changes, everything evolves.
Dialectics!
I'm so glad I bumped into you.
It was me who bumped into you.
I shouldn't have written that note.
But I had to tell you somehow.
Mariano, please.
Yes, forgive me, but...
So you became an engineer!
Tell me all about it.
Gina...
I'd write you the same note.
I must leave.
It was a beautiful letter.
God, I...!
Careful there, gently does it!
Goodness!
You've got the best car in the country.
We should be on the road by now.
Where the devil are those people?
Calm down! You're not going to put out a fire!
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PRESERVE OUR DREAMS.
About bloody time!
Where have you been?
- Come in and have something to eat.
- No, thank you. Here.
- What's this?
- A snack I bought you in a café.
Come on, let's get going!
Gina, come on!
When a flower wilts and dies,
another springs up in its place.
And if a love is lost,
Life takes on another love.
Mariano remembers Gina,
Gina remembers Mariano.
It needn't be a barren memory
the one which springs up
between them.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
The deceased's sister and niece have been calling from Havana.
They're concerned about the delay.
What do they expect? We've stuck to the original plan exactly.
- We're in Camagüey as scheduled.
- Now comes the difficult bit.
Camagüey to Santa Clara.
With a brief stop in Sancti Spíritus.
Remember!
That bitch Paula's there!
There are people in the cafeteria pretending to be bereaved.
Can't you sort it out?
Are you all asleep?
One moment, your ticket.
- Haven't you got a ticket?
- Just a minute.
There's a sign here that clearly says this café is only for mourners.
- I'm a mourner.
- So am I.
Is that so?
Well, I'm not having it.
Listen, here the snacks and the coffee are ordered in advance.
And its all paid for by the close relatives.
Excuse me, what's the problem, sir?
My uncle died last week but nobody gave me a free snack!
- We all have the same rights here.
- Yes, no more privileges!
Anyone would think this was...!
Comrades, comrades!
I've been waiting ages and they've not given me anything.
I have a ticket and I'm entitled.
I know my rights.
Everybody out!
You too.
You too.
I want everybody out!
Now! The cafeteria's closed.
That's the way to do it!
Dead dogs don't bite.
I've got used to it.
It's the best way.
You suffer less.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Ah, Cándido!
I think I missed my chance without even noticing.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
How do you recognize it?
It all happens so fast.
You feel it.
It's something special, like... having and itchy jaw.
Has yourjaw never itched?
Cándido, I'm a married woman!
You're blind, that's what you are.
Ramón, how are you?
Oh, darling, I've been waiting.
Oh, my sweet, I love you.
What took you so long?
Hey, honey, listen.
- I can't stay. I'm pushed for time.
- Yes, come one down.
Hey, give me that. I can't!
Give me that back.
Listen, the lorry broke down and I really haven't got time!
Let's go to the house and I'll do something that you'll just love.
- Come on!
- Come here, love. I'm not joking.
Hey, listen.
I've been thinking, it's about time I took life seriously.
I'm so glad, honey.
I've been thinking the same
We should live together and be happy.
Let's go to the house,
I want to do things to you.
Come on, baby...
- What's up?
- Let's go to the house.
Ramón, we'll be right back.
Be good.
Hey, honey, what's your hurry?
Hey, what's going on?
Where's the linesman?
- Honey, get dressed, we've no time.
- After this, you'll never forget me.
I love you.
- Come to me.
- We haven't time.
I love you, come...
- I've got to go!
- I'll say things I've never said.
Linesman!
Listen! They're calling you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
What's the matter?
What! Raise this barrier right now.
There isn't a train in sight.
Wait there, I'm coming!
Why all the hurry?
Get this jalopy rolling.
Come on, men, let's go.
Oh, my love, these people never leave you in peace.
God! The train!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hey, move that.
Are you mad?
Mad about you, my love.
I'm not moving until you give me a kiss.
Besides, look!
Look what I've got you!
Mammee apple!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hail Mary, God Almighty! Why won't they let me finish with you?
Don't budge, baby.
I'm going to do something to you that you'll love.
- Hey, what's that all about?
- Oh, it's...
It's nothing. Don't get jealous.
I'm all yours, you know that.
I'm crazy about you.
Open up, open up!
Adolfo!
Now what's wrong?
The fan belt's broken.
- You've got a spare, haven't you?
- I haven't got anything.
- Why the bloody hell not?
- What about you?
Have you got a spare liver, eh?
You're going to need it!
We must do something.
- That's more like it!
- Now! I want clockwork precision.
We're 15 miles from Camagüey,
90 miles from Sancti Spíritus.
You, go with me. You, in the Volga.
I must sort this out with Rivero.
You, watch the car.
Hey!
- What's the problem, mate?
- The fan belt's gone.
Why didn't you say?
I've got a spare one.
I always carry one in the back of the lorry.
Let's see what size it is.
- I'll go and fetch one.
- Good man!
What are you doing? No, no!
Heaven forbid! Me, charge you?
Take advantage of this situation?
You can have it. Put that away.
Thanks, son.
Let me pass!
Let me pass!
I'm leaving.
I've got to get back to work.
That's just about got it.
You can start it now.
Me?
Gina!
Mariano!
You asshole!
- What are you doing with her?
- Listen, calm down, calm down!
What's up?
- I'll kill you!
- Calm down, there's been a mix-up.
We're going, Cándido.
Get in.
- Where to? Get in where?
- In the car! Get in the car!
- This one?
- Yes!
- What's the matter, Gina?
- Nothing.
Nothing's the matter.
You really dropped me in it with that jalopy.
Listen, Adolfo, while you've got that car, I have to bury my dead with a horse drawn carriage.
What planet are you living on?
You're responsible for this disaster, and you have to find a solution!
I haven't got a fan belt for that car!
- Get it into your thick head!
- Look for one, then!
- Look where?
- Take one from another car.
This is sabotage! And the consequences could be serious!
Listen a minute, Adolfo.
Let's find a solution.
You know I'm no amateur in this.
I've got a clean record...
What happened?
Nothing, he found a fan belt and...
Come on, Cándido.
Get in there.
We'll use the hearse and have it sent back to Rivero later.
Come on, let's not waste any more time.
- What's up?
- The usual. A corpse.
- It has to be buried in Cárdenas.
- So what?
I've no more hearses! We're in a state of necrological alert here!
But if they say he lived here, why don't they bury him here?
Old man Orlando stated in his will that if he died in Cárdenas, he was to be buried in Sancti Spíritus, and if he died in Sancti Spíritus, he was to be buried in Cárdenas.
What for?
Just to fuck someone up.
And you're that someone.
Do you know what this means?
We'll have to dovetail the services.
But I've got to get to Havana!
And old Orlando to Cárdenas.
The law is the same for everyone.
But this is something unexpected.
Death is always unexpected.
You should know that, from yourjob.
- Where's the office, please?
- Up there.
Thank you.
Adolfo, what did the old lady die of?
Being a whore.
At her age she starts having it off
- with a ridiculous old man...
- I won't stand for that!
Listen, I didn't...
Have some respect for the dead!
Have a good trip.
That was quite ajob!
Okay, Susi, remember about next week.
Okay, big boy.
Next week they're bringing me the black beans and turkeys I ordered.
Take care, and don't get lost, okay?
- Why should I want to do that?
- I love you.
You're such a sweetie.
Look after the pig, okay?
- And look after yourself.
- Yes. Let's go.
What's up now, Ramón?
Get out.
- What?
- I said get out.
What for?
Because we need to fill up with petrol, Mariano, and who's in the next petrol station? Wina!
Your women are too aggressive.
I don't want any part of it.
No, man. Wina's no problem.
I'm the one who's in a mess!
Why?
No reason. Let's get going.
Hey, come on, brother. I told you, there won't be any hassle.
Oh, Mariano, shit...
Mariano!
What?
I have to talk to you about...
What's up, Mariano?
No, nothing.
Well, yes...
I like you a lot.
- Well...
- Mariano,
I got married two weeks ago.
You're kidding!
Fuck me!
That's great...!
Don't pretend, Mariano.
You came to ditch me.
Me?
Yes, you.
How's things?
Fine.
Let's have a coffee.
Ramón!
Come and have a coffee.
Come and have a coffee.
No, it's okay, thanks.
Come on, there's no problem.
Come on!
Wina!
Have you got a pen?
What's up now, Mariano?
Hey, wait there, brother.
Hey!
I'm sorry, but I'm going on alone.
I'm so ashamed.
It was all so unpleasant.
Why? It has nothing to do with you.
- You don't belong with that animal.
- Don't be like that.
Pay no attention to him. Don't you realize that he's insensitive?
It's because he is insensitive that you don't belong with him.
I'm the one who feels sad really sad, when I see how you're throwing your life away on that man.
- It's not fair!
- Oh, Cándido.
There are times in life when you have to make decisions.
I've made mine.
Oh, look.
It's the deceased's granddaughter.
Thanks to them
I'll get to Cárdenas.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Pleased to meet you.
Take care.
Great care.
- Bye.
- See you soon.
- Gina.
- Yes?
I don't like to interfere, but I was just passing...
What's up? Talking again?
Come on. We've wasted enough time. Gina. Come on.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
Make sure you tell Paula.
You should never tread on
your neighbour's feelings,
because the wind
will blow away
that sort of behaviour.
What has your life been,
Adolfo?
Without principles,
without decency,
with no respect for love,
it's a lost battle.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
- The body for Cardenas is yours.
- No.
I said this was madness from the start, and no one listened.
Now the facts have proved me right.
In no time at all, three funerals have passed through here, one for Cienfuegos, another for Aguada de Pasajeros, and the third for Sancti Spíritus.
The corpse bound for Cárdenas is all yours!
I pioneered this operation, and I do the calculations.
My funeral gets priority.
Well, whether you like it or not,
I can't separate the funerals because I've only got one hearse left.
This isn't over yet! I'm taking it up with the pertinent authorities.
Take it to the top, if you like.
I'm as happy with a funeral as a homage.
You say he'd never had a sick day in his life?
The poor thing was full of life.
He liked walking, horse riding, climbing hills...
He didn't want to die and... just look...
- How are you?
- So, so...
The day of his 107th birthday, the photographer asked him to step back from the camera, to get a better photo.
A bit further back, a bit further...
But he didn't know he was on the edge of a precipice.
It's my first visit to Santa Clara.
- I've never visited anywhere.
- Oh, Cándido!
Look!
Just like Yoyita's dress.
Remember?
Yes, we bought it together.
Yes.
Well, it would look lovely on you.
- Hi, Tony.
- Hello.
Do you sell soft drinks?
We've only got tea and rum.
- Would you like a tea, Cándido?
- Okay...
Two teas.
Just a minute, I'll be right back.
Listen, friend, you can't fit two coffins in this hearse without damaging them.
We'll have to wait for the hearse from Camagüey.
How long will that take?
An hour, an hour and a half.
No way. We're in a real hurry.
Let's try a little harder, push a bit harder.
A bit more... push, push!
It's coming! That's got it!
There!
Gina!
You look like a whore with your hair loose.
I don't trust that old man.
You're to stop talking to him.
And you can change that dress right now!
Listen when I'm talking!
Keep out of it, old man.
Who do you think you are?
Stop!
- Let her go, dammit!
- What the...!
Come on, mate.
I told you,
I'm tired of telling you...
You enjoy looking for trouble.
In the beginning
Olofin made man and woman
and gave them life.
Olofin made life,
but he forgot to make death.
The years passed
and the men and women
got older and older,
but they did not die.
The Earth filled up with people
who were thousands of years old,
and who still ruled according
to their ancient laws.
The young people
clamoured such that
one day their cries
reached the ears
of Olofin.
Olofin saw that the world
was not as good as he had
planned.
He felt
that he also was
too old and tired
to begin again
what had turned out so badly.
So Olofin called lkú
to take care of the matter.
And lkú saw
that it was time to put
an end to the era
in which people did not die.
So lkú caused it to rain
upon the earth for 30 days
and 30 nights without end,
and all was covered
with water.
Only
the children and the young were
able to climb the giant trees
and climb the highest mountains.
The whole Earth became
a huge river with no banks.
The young people then saw
that the Earth was cleaner
and more beautiful,
and ran to give thanks to lkú
for putting and end
to immortality.
They told me the one on the right.
- That one has to go to Havana.
- No, this is the right one.
The one on the right is this one, old man.
We're not going to spend all day here arguing.
One has a blue ribbon attached.
It's the other one.
This one?
Exactly.
Excuse me, miss.
When's the next bus to Havana?
Ticket sales are suspended until tomorrow.
Thank you.
Hello, Adolfo.
How was the journey?
Look, this is the car.
This is your driver.
I'll send you some men right away to help with the changeover.
I've a terrible headache.
Do you have an aspirin?
Certainly, madam.
Follow me to the office.
Come on, Adolfo.
I know how uncomfortable these journeys can be.
Brother, I need a favour.
I've come from the East and
I've got the boot full of stuff.
I tell you, madam, they'll have to give your husband a medal when he gets to Havana.
Gina!
Forgive me, I didn't know what I was doing.
Don't be like this, not now when I need you most.
There are 60 miles left to Havana.
Change that dress.
Back in Guantánamo, everything will be just as it was.
Nothing will be the same now.
I know you too well.
And I'm tired of not thinking.
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes.
That radio show José Luis keeps offering me, I'm going to accept.
A radio programme?
On youth guidance?
You weren't even capable of bringing up your own bloody daughter.
I'm fed up of your blaming me for Niurka's going to Miami!
Who was it who let her hang around with those hairy pseudo-intellectuals and listen to their songs?
Who let her read magazines about
"perestroika" and all that shit?
Oh, Adolfo!
Remember the things she came out with?
For the first time I had to raise my hand to her.
My own daughter!
Of course she bloody left, after you poisoned her mind!
Niurka didn't leave because of her friends, or the songs, or what she read.
She left because she had to do all those things in secret.
- And she was fed up of that!
- No!
Wait! I let you have your say, now it's my turn.
Yes, you're right.
Who am I to to give guidance to anyone?
If I take on that programme, as I want to, it's not to tell anyone what to think.
Far be it from me to give anyone instructions!
You don't know me at all.
As for the dress,
I'm not changing it.
It's there in the back.
Cover it with the flowers.
Shit! This is going to be a problem.
Put it here, and if it lifts its head, just push it down again.
Here.
A gift.
Come on, old timer.
So they dropped you like a hot potato in the middle of the road?
No.
I left of my own accord, to get away from that animal.
It seems some people put up with him very well.
Listen, old man.
I need a favour.
When you see Gina, tell her I want her to forgive me.
I get into all sorts of trouble for not minding my own business.
Why not ask her yourself, son?
See what she says.
I hope I never bump into that woman again.
The name's Ramón.
Just ask for me at work.
Help him down, Mariano.
Be careful, there.
Well, son...
Take care.
Cándido!
I'll give you a written report tomorrow.
But I can tell you now, we saved no less than sixty litres of petrol and two days expenses in cash.
Any trouble on the way?
There are always problems, but there are always solutions, too.
In Sancti Spíritus I put the two coffins for Cárdenas together.
Here's the order.
Here it is.
Shit!
What's wrong?
Cándido, please...
- The ladder.
- Yes.
Dear friends, families of the deceased.
On this morning we are united by a great sorrow.
Two very dear people are no longer with us.
Out of love, and only love, they have crossed the threshold of silence which leads us to immortality.
We are here today to say farewell to two unforgettable people, two lovers who, across time and space, kept their hearts united.
Two beings, consecrated to love,
Aunt Yoyita, as her nearest and dearest affectionately called her, and that fine fellow, Cándido, the generous musician who often cheered our Sundays from the bandstand in our distant hometown,
Guantánamo.
They lived the most sublime moments of love.
For years, only their memory kept alive the flame of that love...
A love which grew in their hearts, until, suddenly, both hearts burst as one in a flood of happiness, joy and immaculate glory.
In that one moment they touched the bounds of eternity.
Death unites them today in an imperishable embrace.
Those who die of love bequeath a lesson, at their passing, to those of us who remain, disconsolate and somewhat Ionelier on this side of the threshold.
That lesson, my friends, teaches us that love is the salt of life.
It is our task to follow the path which they trod, hand in hand like two lovers in search of eternal bliss.
Hey, listen!
Don't go!
Wait! I haven't finished my speech.
Help!
Don't leave me here alone!
Help!
The ladder!
Bring me the ladder!

I'm very excited.
Oh, me too!
And I want everything to be perfect.
That goes in the banquet room!
Quick, quick!
It's on its way to the banquet room right now, m'lady.
Ah! Very good.
Thank you, baileywick!
( Sighs ) Here, let me straighten your tiara.
Thanks, Amber.
Oh.
Up we go.
Now, wait until you see where we're sleeping tonight.
Oh, and here we are!
The observatory!
Wow, Amber!
We're going to sleep here?
Yes, we are!
This is amazing!
It is, isn't it?
And there's one more thing:
The most important part of any great royal party...
Yes?
The guests.
I invited princess hildegard and princess clio.
They're the most popular princesses in school.
Who did you invite?
Ruby and jade.
Oh, I don't know them.
What kingdom are they from?
Ours. They're my friends from the village.
You invited village girls?
They're really awesome.
But they're not princesses.
Amber, I know you're going to love them.
We used to have the best sleepovers.
Sofia...
Must I remind you...
Again, that this is your first slumber party as a princess.
You do want to make a good impression, don't you?
Yes, but Ruby and jade are so much fun.
Wait 'til you see this dance they do.
They're going to make this the best party ever,
I promise.
Ow! Oh, what is it?
Cedric.
Oh, king Roland.
Queen Miranda.
The girls are having a slumber party tonight.
Oh, I can already hear the endless giggling now.
And we were hoping you could put on a little magic show for them.
You want your royal sorcerer to, uh, entertain the children?
We actually wanted the Jester, but he's out sick.
Let's say 8:00 in the royal playroom?
And could you do a few card tricks?
You know, children love card tricks.
Oh, and card tricks love children.
Of course, your majesty.
Great.
Thank you, Cedric.
Yes, my queen.
Oh, I can't believe this!
Fifteen years of sorcerer training, so I can be a warm-up act for milk and cookies!
Indeed, wormy.
Well, I'll show them.
I'll use this little magic show to steal the amulet of avalor from princess Sofia.
The only question is how.
Ah-ha! I'll have my little puppets put on the magic show!
And the one and only trick will be to make Sofia's amulet disappear right into my hand!
Puppetti venite!
I will finally have the power to take over the kingdom!
They're here!
May I present, from the kingdom of corinthia, princess clio!
And from the kingdom of freezenberg, princess hildegard!
Wow.
Mm-hmm.
Hildegard. Clio.
Amber. Sofia.
So nice of you to invite us.
And from the village of dunwiddie,
Ruby and jade!
Sofia!
Princess Amber!
Jade! Ruby!
Here I come.
I gotcha.
Both: Hi, Sofia!
Welcome to our castle!
I can't believe we're here.
This is going to be so much fun.
Oh my goodness, I'm so excited I couldn't even sleep last night.
I was thinking about being in a real life castle like, do princesses brush their own teeth or does someone brush them for you?
I brushed mine twice today, especially for the party.
See?
Wow, princess Amber!
I love your tiara!
Can I touch it!?
Absolutely not.
Princesses clio!
Princess hildegard!
It's such an honor.
I'm a big fan, big fan.
Oh, a white squirrel!
How cute!
Lulu is a mink.
I have a pet donkey!
Isn't he cute?
Welcome to the royal sleepover.
Ooh, come on, Ruby!
Last one in goes to the dungeon.
Our castle steward baileywick will help you all get settled.
Thank you, your majesties!

How would you two like a royal makeover?
Can we?
We can make it work.
First, the dresses.
Oh, thank you helpful bird friends.
Oh! So soft!
So silky!
Hooray!
And now, for the hair.
Let's do something stylish but regal.
And tall. Very tall.
Oh!
There.
And there.
Wait. Yes. Back.
Ah!
Ouch!
I've never had my hair done by a bird before.
Front. Down. Back.
No. Yes!
And last but not least, the tiaras.
Baileywick:
And... done.
I'm a princess now!
They look just like princesses, don't they?
They look the part.
But can they act it?
Ooh! ( Grunts )
Oh!
Oh! You okay?
Baileywick: Okay!
It's time for the first activity: Fan decorating!
Princesses one and all, follow me.
What kind of flowers are you painting, hildegard?
Roses.
What kind of flowers are you painting, clio?
Roses.
What kind of flowers are you painting, Amber?
Roses.
I'm Mr. happy fan.
Say "hi" to happy fan.
Sofia!
Ruby. Can you just paint roses?
Don't make me
Mr. sad fan!
Ruby.
Okay.
Baileywick!
Is it time for pin the tail on the unicorn yet?
It is now.
( Sighs ) Great.
Ooh! Ooh! Can I go first?
Unicorns are my favorite animal in the whole world!
No offense.
Which way should I go?
Ruby: Left.
Left?
No. Right.
Um, right? Uh?
Now left.
Left? Uh...
Wait! Not that far.
Wh-whoa! Aah! Oh! Oh!
Stop. Stop, jade, stop.
Ruby: Watch out for the planets.
Look at me!
I'm the princess of Venus!
Oh!
Did someone else want a turn?
Sofia, I need to talk to you.
( Gasps ) The bell!
That must mean it's time for a new activity.
Yes, indeed.
Cedric's magic show is about to start.
Right this way.
( Sighs ) A magic show!
Doesn't that sound like a fun activity that everyone
can enjoy together?
Ah! In just a few moments,
Sofia's magical amulet will be mine.
Right. Let's practice this one more time from the top.
Yeah? Okay.
For my first magic trick,
I will make an object disappear!
Now, who will loan me their amulet for this trick?
Oh, everyone's a critic.
Jade: Princess clio,
I heard it gets warm in your kingdom...
Do you really have swimming pools in every room of your castle?
Yes.
How many dresses do you have?
Princess hildegard, I've always wanted to know how many tiaras do you have?
Wow. 84?
How many gowns?
More than I can count.
I bet you can count really high!
Sofia, do something about your friends.
Ruby, uh, did you know there's a chocolate milk fountain?
Why don't we get some before the show starts?
A chocolate milk fountain?
Sofia, this is so much fun!
I'm having the best time.
Thanks for inviting us.
Sure.
Jade! Save me a seat, front and center!
All they have to do now is sit quietly and watch a magic show.
What could go wrong?
Welcome to the greatest and only magical puppet show in enchancia!
For my first magic trick,
I will make an object disappear.
Now who will lend me their amulet for my trick?
How about you, little princess?
How about a pinecone?
Can you make that disappear?
No! No pine...
No, I need an amulet.
Only an amulet!
Do you know any card tricks?
I love those!
James: Hey, everybody!
Mom and dad asked me to tell you that th...
Both: Prince James!
Remember us?
We met the last time we were at the castle.
No!
Ruby: You poured me tea!
Merlin's mushroom!
My nightgown...
Is ruined.
It's only a drop.
Look at it! It's ruined!
It's ruined.
We're so, so sorry.
Jade: So sorry.
This was my third favorite gown.
Amber, it was just an accident.
Oh no.
Oh dear, oh dear.
Okay you two.
Let's go to the dressing room and get you cleaned up.
What are you doing here, James?
Mom and dad wanted me to tell you there's dancing in the ballroom.
Then maybe we can enjoy five minutes of our party without Sofia's friends
getting in the way.
No. My friends are ruining the party.
That was the funniest thing that's ever happened at one of Amber's sleepovers.
Oh! It was awful!
Jade and Ruby have done everything wrong since they got here.
Says who?
Amber. Hildegard. Clio.
So? Who cares what they think.
Everyone!
Well, what do you think?
I don't know.
I just don't want them to ruin the rest of the party!
Where is everybody?
In the ballroom, but can I talk to you guys first?
Sure.
I love to talk!
Yeah. That's the thing.
I want you both to fit in with the princesses.
And you want to fit in with them too, right?
We look just like them now, don't we?
Yes. You do.
But now you have to act like them.
Both: Huh?
Princesses don't talk so much, or laugh so loud, or make so many messes.
We talk too much?
We laugh too loud?
We were just having fun.
But we're sorry, we didn't realize we were causing problems.
We'll try to act, uh, more like the other princesses.
Oh, great. Thank you!
Just act like them.
Hmm?
Hmm.
Do you know how to do that?
Uh... no.
Let's give it a try.
Are you having any fun?
Nope.
Um, Sofia?
We're gonna go home.
What? Why?
We're not having a good time.
But you're finally fitting in!
And the best news is you're not embarrassing me anymore!
We were embarrassing you?
Sofia, I'm sorry if we talk too much and laugh too loud for your fancy new friends.
But we like to talk and we like to laugh.
And if that's not okay with you now that you're a princess, then maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore!
Hmm!
Don't worry about them, Sofia.
You're with us now.
But I wanted to be with them.
Ruby? Jade?
Oh no.
Jade just asked me to summon her father.
Is everything all right?
I told jade and Ruby to act more like the princesses.
I was trying to help them fit in.
But I just made them feel bad.
It seems to me the only one who needs to act more like a princess...
Is you.
Me?
Being a real princess is all about how you treat people, Sofia.
And if someone is your friend, you should like them for who they are.
You shouldn't try to change them, no matter who else is around.
I really messed up.
( Sighs ) Now it's too late to do anything about it.
Well, it's never too late to start acting like a princess.
And saying you're sorry is a great place to start.
You know, they're probably still here.
Go on.
You better hurry.
Thanks, mom.
Ruby! Jade! Wait!
I'm sorry!
Please don't leave!
Hmm! I thought we were embarrassing you.
You're not embarrassing me.
You're perfect just like you are.
You're sweet and loyal and so much fun to be with.
We are pretty fun.
And, you're my best friends.
I'm sorry about the way
I acted tonight.
And I'm really, really hoping you'll give me a chance to make it up to you.
I don't know.
We can start over and have our own slumber party.
Like we used to.
What do you say?
Just the three of us?
Hurry! Hurry! I wanna see.
Hmm? Not bad.
Hmm. Something's missing.
Oh finally, it's just us princesses.
Now this
is a perfect slumber party.
You know, Sofia's friends
were kinda fun.
Jade: Pinecone princess is back!
Sofia: This is the best slumber party ever!
Jade: Ruby, that's a funny dance.
Oh! Who could that be at this late hour?
Um, Sofia?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Hmm? Sure.
We, uh, we heard a lot of laughing, and, and noise and stuff down here and uh, I, we just wanted to make sure everything was...
All, all right.
Oh, we're fine.
In fact, we're having a great time.
Really?
How about you guys?
Oh, um, well, us?
Oh, oh, well, you know, we're, um, uh...
Pardon me?
Well, we're, we're having...
It's, it's kind of, um, well, it's different..
Amber, your party's no fun without Ruby and jade, is it?
Okay, yes, Sofia!
We're so bored without the three of you!
Is there room for a few more princesses at our party?
The more the merrier.
( Giggles ) Thank you.
And one, two, three and forward, back and chicken elbows.

{1740}{1810}It has been spared the sensational publicity
{1812}{1894}of such questionable honours|as the Pulitzer Prize
{1896}{2013}and those awards presented annually|by that... film society.
{2015}{2110}The distinguished-Iooking gentleman|is an extremely old actor.
{2112}{2194}Being an actor,|he will go on speakingfor some time.
{2196}{2270}It is not important thatyou hear what he says.
{2272}{2375}However, it is important thatyou know|where you are and why you are here.
{2377}{2463}This is the dining hall|of the Sarah Siddons Society.
{2465}{2597}It is the annual banquet and presentation|of the highest honour our theatre has:
{2599}{2686}the Sarah Siddons Awardfor|Distinguished Achievement.
{2688}{2757}These hallowed walls,|indeed many of these faces,
{2759}{2859}have looked upon Modjeska,|Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.
{2861}{2939}Mansfield's voice filled this room.
{2941}{3033}It is unlikely that the windows|have been opened since his death.
{3039}{3151}The minor awards, as you can see,|have already been presented.
{3153}{3236}Minor awards are for such|as the writer and director,
{3238}{3303}since they merely construct a tower
{3305}{3399}so that the world can applaud|a light which flashes on top of it.
{3401}{3506}And no brighter light has ever|dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.
{3508}{3589}Eve... but more of Eve later.
{3591}{3642}All about Eve, in fact.
{3644}{3783}To those who do not read, attend the theatre,|listen to unsponsored radio programmes
{3785}{3851}or know anything of the world|in which you live,
{3853}{3934}it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.
{3936}{3988}My name is Addison DeWitt.
{3990}{4127}My native habitat is the theatre.|In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.
{4129}{4189}I am a critic and commentator.
{4191}{4255}I am essential to the theatre.
{4257}{4307}This is Karen Richards.
{4309}{4417}She is the wife of a playwright,|therefore of the theatre by marriage.
{4419}{4573}Nothing in her background should have|brought her closer to the stage than Row E.
{4575}{4696}However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,|Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.
{4698}{4797}The following year|Karen became Mrs Lloyd Richards.
{4799}{4888}There are, in general,|two types of theatrical producers.
{4890}{4998}One has a great many wealthy friends|who will risk a tax-deductible loss.
{5000}{5059}This type is interested in art.
{5061}{5166}The other is one to whom each production|means potential ruin or fortune.
{5168}{5218}This type is out to make a buck.
{5225}{5277}Meet Max Fabian.
{5279}{5424}He is the producer of the play which has won|for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award.
{5445}{5533}Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.
{5535}{5673}She made her first stage appearance at|the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.
{5675}{5786}She played a fairy and entered,|quite unexpectedly, stark naked.
{5788}{5848}She has been a star ever since.
{5869}{5947}Margo is a great star. A true star.
{5949}{6045}She never was or will be|anything less or anything else.
{6082}{6221}Having covered in tedious detail not only|the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,
{6223}{6355}but also the history of acting since|Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line,
{6357}{6461}our distinguished chairman has finally|arrived at our reason for being here.
{6463}{6615}I have been proud and privileged|to have spent my life in the theatre,
{6617}{6736}a poor player that struts|and frets his hour upon the stage,
{6753}{6823}and I've been honoured to be, for 40 years,
{6825}{6919}chief prompter of the Sarah Siddons Society.
{6945}{7061}39 times have I placed in deserving hands
{7063}{7150}this highest honour the theatre knows.
{7152}{7222}Surely no actor is older than I.
{7224}{7294}I've earned my place - out of the sun.
{7325}{7465}And never before has this award gone to|anyone younger than its recipient tonight.
{7467}{7567}How fitting that it should|pass from my hands to hers.
{7573}{7659}Such young hands. Such a young lady.
{7669}{7779}Young in years, but whose heart|is as old as the theatre.
{7788}{7838}Some of us are privileged to know her.
{7840}{7920}We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry
{7922}{8000}that have made her name|resound through the nation.
{8002}{8096}We know her humility, her devotion,
{8098}{8149}her Ioyalty to her art,
{8151}{8261}her love, her deep and abiding love for us,
{8263}{8376}for what we are and what we do - the theatre.
{8387}{8445}She has had one wish,
{8447}{8512}one prayer, one dream:
{8540}{8601}to belong to us.
{8607}{8664}Tonight her dream has come true,
{8666}{8759}and henceforth|we shall dream the same of her.
{8761}{8874}Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished|achievement in the theatre,
{8876}{8973}the Sarah Siddons Award...|to Miss Eve Harrington.
{9938}{10034}Eve. Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.
{10036}{10143}The girl next door, the girl on the moon.|Time has been good to Eve.
{10145}{10268}Life goes where she goes. She's been|profiled, covered, revealed, reported,
{10270}{10341}what she eats and what|she wears and whom she knows
{10343}{10419}and where she was and|when and where she's going.
{10421}{10465}Eve.
{10467}{10527}You all know all about Eve.
{10551}{10619}What can there be to know|that you don't know?
{10642}{10710}When was it? How long?
{10712}{10776}It seems a lifetime ago.
{10778}{10888}Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetime|was a season and a season a lifetime.
{10890}{10979}It's June now. That was early October.
{11003}{11053}Only last October.
{11104}{11194}It was a drizzly night.|I remember I asked the taxi to wait.
{11351}{11386}Where was she?
{11388}{11500}Strange. I'd become so accustomed|to seeing her there night after night,
{11502}{11578}I found myself lookingfor a girl|I'd never spoken to.
{11580}{11640}Wondering where she was.
{11769}{11823}Mrs Richards?
{11849}{11907}There you are.
{11909}{12010}It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here.
{12012}{12094}- Why should you think I wouldn't be?|- Why should you be?
{12096}{12209}Six nights a week for weeks of watching even|Margo Channing enter and leave a theatre.
{12211}{12276}- You don't mind my speaking to you?|- Not at all.
{12278}{12368}I've seen you so often.|It took every bit of courage I could raise.
{12370}{12432}To speakto just a playwright's wife?
{12434}{12493}I'm the lowest form of celebrity.
{12495}{12599}You're Margo Channing's best friend.|You and your husband are always with her.
{12601}{12692}And Mr Sampson. What's he like?
{12694}{12776}Bill Sampson? He's a director.
{12778}{12832}- He's the best.|- He'll agree with you.
{12834}{12956}Tell me. What do you do in between|the time Margo goes in and comes out?
{12958}{13018}Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
{13020}{13092}No. I see the play.
{13094}{13207}You see the play? You've seen|every performance of this play?
{13209}{13258}Yes.
{13260}{13373}But don'tyou find it, apart from|everything else, don'tyou find it expensive?
{13375}{13450}Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
{13497}{13553}- I'm gonna take you to Margo.|- No.
{13555}{13643}- Yes. She's got to meetyou.|- No, I'd be imposing on her.
{13645}{13695}I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.
{13697}{13774}There isn't another like you.|There couldn't be.
{13776}{13842}If I'd known... Some other time.|Looking like this.
{13844}{13930}You look just fine.|By the way, what's your name?
{13932}{13982}Eve. Eve Harrington.
{14067}{14145}- Good evening, Gus.|- Good evening, Mrs Richards.
{14164}{14214}- Good night.|- Good night, Gus.
{14675}{14735}You can breathe it, can'tyou?
{14765}{14825}Like some magic perfume.
{15030}{15080}Wait right here. Don't run away.
{15082}{15163}"If the South had won,|you could write plays about the North."
{15165}{15221}- Hi.|- Hello!
{15223}{15290}"I don't think|you can rightly say we lost the war."
{15292}{15354}"We was more starved out, you might say."
{15356}{15452}"I don't understand all these plays|about love-starved Southern women."
{15454}{15541}"Love is one thing we were|never starved for in the South."
{15543}{15605}Margo's interview with|a reporter from the South.
{15607}{15686}When it gets printed, they're|gonna fire on Gettysburg again.
{15688}{15785}- It was Fort Sumter they fired on.|- I never played Fort Sumter.
{15822}{15920}Honeychild had a point.|Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.
{15922}{16027}Write me one about a nice, normal woman|who just shoots her husband.
{16029}{16089}- You need new girdles.|- Buy some.
{16091}{16136}- Same size?|- Of course.
{16138}{16213}I find these wisecracks|increasingly less funny.
{16215}{16316}- Aged in Woodhappens to be a fine play.|- That's my Ioyal little woman.
{16318}{16378}The critics thought so.|The audiences think so.
{16380}{16467}Packed houses, tickets|four months in advance.
{16469}{16531}I can't see that Lloyd's plays|have hurtyou any.
{16533}{16630}- Easy now.|- Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.
{16632}{16768}You get me so mad sometimes. Of all|the women with nothing to complain about...
{16770}{16822}- Ain't it the truth?|- Yes, it is.
{16824}{16883}You're talented, famous, wealthy.
{16885}{16986}People waiting around night after night|just to see you. Even in the rain.
{16988}{17118}Autograph fiends. They're not people. Little|beasts that run around in packs like coyotes.
{17120}{17189}- They're your fans.|- They're nobody's fans.
{17191}{17282}They're juvenile delinquents.|They're nobody's audience.
{17285}{17377}They never see a play or a movie.|They're never indoors long enough.
{17379}{17461}Well, there's one indoors right now.
{17485}{17546}- I've brought her backto see you.|- You've what?
{17557}{17617}She's just outside the door.
{17619}{17666}The heave-ho.
{17668}{17732}But you can't put her out. I promised.
{17734}{17849}Margo, you've got to see her. She worships|you. It's like something out of a book.
{17851}{17913}That book is out of print.|Those days are gone.
{17924}{17992}But if you'd only see her...|You're her whole life.
{17994}{18084}You must have spotted her by now.|She's always there.
{18086}{18185}The mousy one with|the trench coat and the funny hat.
{18187}{18261}How could I miss her?|Every night, every matinée.
{18346}{18396}Come in, Eve.
{18475}{18539}- I thoughtyou'd forgotten about me.|- Not at all.
{18541}{18593}Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
{18595}{18655}- How do you do, my dear?|- Oh, brother.
{18657}{18704}- Hello, Miss Channing.|- My husband.
{18706}{18757}- Hello, Miss Harrington.|- How do you do?
{18759}{18836}And this is my dear friend|and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
{18838}{18892}- Oh, brother.|- Miss Coonan.
{18894}{18958}- Oh, brother, what?|- When she gets like this,
{18960}{19013}she starts playing Hamlet's mother.
{19015}{19106}I'm sure you must have things|to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.
{19108}{19192}If I haven't, I'll find|something till you get normal.
{19278}{19342}Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
{19344}{19371}Harrington.
{19373}{19463}- I'm so sorry. Won'tyou sit down?|- Thank you.
{19546}{19640}- Would you like a drink?|- I was saying how often you've seen the play.
{19642}{19679}No, thank you.
{19681}{19726}Yes, I've seen every performance.
{19728}{19832}Every performance?|Then am I safe in assuming you like it?
{19842}{19955}- I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.|- Would you really? How sweet.
{19957}{20033}I doubt very much that|you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.
{20035}{20103}Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards.
{20105}{20219}I think part of Miss Channing's greatness|lies in her ability to pickthe best plays.
{20221}{20321}- Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it?|- Of course it is.
{20323}{20411}- How did you hear about it?|- There was an item in The Times.
{20413}{20480}I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.
{20482}{20531}Yes, but let's get backto this one.
{20533}{20610}- Have you really seen every performance?|- Yes.
{20612}{20661}Why? I'm curious.
{20663}{20795}Well, if I didn't come to see the play,|I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
{20799}{20911}- There are other plays.|- Not with you in them. Not by Mr Richards.
{20913}{20995}But you must have friends, a home, family?
{21050}{21110}Tell us about it, Eve.
{21136}{21212}- If I only knew how.|- Try.
{21249}{21303}Well...
{21741}{21818}Well, it started with the play before this one.
{21820}{21876}- Remembrance.|- Remembrance.
{21878}{21950}- Did you see it here in New York?|- San Francisco.
{21963}{22036}It was the last week. I went one night.
{22038}{22112}The most important night|of my life... until now.
{22114}{22213}I found myself going the next night|and the next and the next.
{22215}{22269}Every performance.
{22271}{22362}Then, when the show went East, I went East.
{22372}{22484}- Eve, why don'tyou start at the beginning?|- It couldn't possibly interestyou.
{22492}{22542}Please.
{22559}{22658}I guess it started back home.|Wisconsin, that is.
{22660}{22717}It was just Mom and Dad and me.
{22719}{22823}I was an only child.|I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid.
{22825}{22921}Acted out all sorts of things.|What they were isn't important.
{22923}{23044}But, somehow, acting and make-believe|began to fill up my life more and more.
{23063}{23136}It got so I couldn't tell|the real from the unreal.
{23138}{23218}Except that the unreal|seemed more real to me...
{23252}{23341}- I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?|- Not at all.
{23365}{23477}Farmers were poor in those days.|That's what Dad was, a farmer.
{23479}{23530}I had to help out.
{23532}{23716}So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,|became a secretary... in a brewery.
{23718}{23845}When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's|hard to make believe you're anything else.
{23847}{23894}Everything is beer.
{23925}{23990}It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.
{24009}{24144}And there was a little theatre group there,|like a drop of rain on the desert.
{24146}{24196}That's where I met Eddie.
{24198}{24268}He was a radio technician.
{24270}{24335}We played Liliomfor three performances.
{24363}{24423}I was awful.
{24425}{24511}Then the war came and we got married.
{24513}{24563}Eddie was in the air force.
{24565}{24625}They sent him to the South Pacific.
{24649}{24773}You were with the OWl, weren'tyou,|Mr Richards? That's what Who's Who says.
{24787}{24892}Well, with Eddie gone,|my life went backto beer.
{24894}{24948}Except for a letter a week.
{24950}{25029}One week he wrote me|he had leave coming up.
{25031}{25158}I'd saved my money and vacation time|and went to San Francisco to meet him.
{25190}{25253}But Eddie wasn't there.
{25255}{25325}They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee.
{25327}{25388}The one that came from Washington.
{25390}{25460}To say that... Eddie wasn't coming at all.
{25496}{25557}That Eddie was dead.
{25701}{25763}I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.
{25765}{25847}I was alone. I couldn't go back without Eddie.
{25880}{25942}I found a job, and his insurance helped.
{25977}{26054}And there were theatres in San Francisco.
{26056}{26168}And then, one night, Margo Channing|came to play in Remembrance,
{26170}{26220}and I went to see it.
{26276}{26321}Well...
{26323}{26374}Here I am.
{26508}{26618}What a story. Everything but|the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.
{26626}{26734}There are some human experiences that|do not take place in a vaudeville house!
{26736}{26839}And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian|should understand and respect.
{26863}{26979}- I want to apologise for Birdie.|- You don't have to apologise for me.
{27053}{27173}I'm sorry if I hurtyour feelings.|It's just my way of talking.
{27175}{27238}You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.
{27240}{27290}Call me Birdie.
{27307}{27363}And as for being fifth-rate,
{27365}{27466}I closed the first half|for eleven years, and you know it.
{27624}{27694}47 minutes from now my plane takes off|and how do I find you?
{27696}{27767}- Not ready, looking like a junkyard.|- Thank you so much.
{27769}{27850}Is it sabotage?|Have you no human consideration?
{27852}{27944}- Show me a human and I might have.|- Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.
{27946}{28025}I start shooting a week from Monday.|Zanuck is impatient.
{28027}{28078}Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers?
{28080}{28149}- Only in some ways. You're prettier.|- I'm a junkyard.
{28151}{28230}- Bill. This is Eve Harrington.|- Hi.
{28232}{28342}My wonderful junkyard. The mystery|and dreams you find in a junkyard.
{28344}{28389}Heaven help me.
{28391}{28441}I love a psychotic.
{28483}{28578}- Hello. What's your name?|- Eve Harrington.
{28580}{28642}- You've already met.|- Where?
{28644}{28743}- Right here, just a minute ago.|- That's nice.
{28825}{28893}- You're not going, are you?|- I think I'd better.
{28895}{29006}It's been... I can hardly find|the words to say how it's been.
{29008}{29056}No, don't go.
{29058}{29178}The four of you must have so much to say|to each other with Mr Sampson leaving.
{29200}{29259}No, stick around, please.
{29261}{29386}Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky|on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.
{29388}{29455}Well, if I'm not in the way...
{29457}{29507}I won't be a minute.
{29604}{29654}Lloyd, we've got to go.
{29781}{29821}Good night, Margo.
{29823}{29893}- I'll call you tomorrow.|- Not too early.
{29974}{30065}- Good luck, genius.|- Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.
{30092}{30180}- I'm not worried aboutyou.|- Keep the thought.
{30187}{30260}Good night, Eve.|I hope I see you again soon.
{30262}{30382}- I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinée.|- Not just that way. As a friend.
{30384}{30434}I'd like that.
{30501}{30598}- It's been a real pleasure, Eve.|- I hope so, Mr Richards. Good night.
{30600}{30657}Good night.
{30659}{30704}Mrs Richards?
{30709}{30777}I'll never forget this night as long as I live.
{30779}{30860}And I'll never forgetyou|for making it possible.
{30987}{31059}And I'll never forgetyou, Eve.
{31061}{31139}Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?
{31141}{31202}Funny, the things you remember...
{31204}{31254}and the things you don't.
{31465}{31526}So you're going to Hollywood?
{31580}{31652}- Why?|- I just wondered.
{31654}{31726}- Just wondered what?|- Why?
{31745}{31827}- Why what?|- Why you have to go out... there.
{31851}{31939}- I don't have to. I want to.|- Is it the money?
{31962}{32015}80%of it'll go for taxes.
{32023}{32132}Then why? Why, if you're the most|successful young director in the theatre...
{32136}{32196}The theatre. The theatre.
{32198}{32286}What rules say the theatre exists|only within some ugly buildings
{32288}{32355}crowded into one|square mile of New York City?
{32357}{32407}Or London, Paris or Vienna?
{32456}{32518}Listen, Junior, and learn.
{32520}{32638}Do you wanna know what the theatre is?|A flea circus. Also opera.
{32665}{32730}Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,
{32732}{32835}Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,|a one-man band - all theatre.
{32837}{32957}Wherever there's magic and make-believe|and an audience, there's theatre.
{32983}{33057}Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.
{33059}{33162}Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.|Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.
{33164}{33239}Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse -|all theatre.
{33254}{33324}You don't understand them all.|You don't like them all.
{33326}{33449}Why should you? The theatre's for everybody|- you included - but not exclusively.
{33451}{33515}So, don't approve or disapprove.
{33517}{33609}It may not be your theatre,|but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.
{33611}{33671}I just asked a simple question.
{33696}{33762}And I shot my mouth off.
{33764}{33838}Nothing personal, Junior. No offence.
{33840}{33969}It's just that there's so much bushwa in|this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,
{33971}{34029}sometimes it gets up around my chin.
{34039}{34113}But Hollywood. You mustn't stay out there.
{34130}{34203}- It's only a one-picture deal.|- So few come back.
{34269}{34346}I read George Jean Nathan every week.
{34348}{34430}- Also Addison DeWitt.|- Every day.
{34467}{34540}You didn't have to tell me.
{34542}{34592}It's the latest thing - one earring.
{34594}{34690}If it isn't, it's going to be.|I can't find the other one.
{34692}{34753}Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me.
{34755}{34832}- Where do you suppose it could be?|- It'll show up.
{34834}{34911}I give up. Look in the wigs.|Maybe it got caught in one.
{34913}{34981}Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in.
{34983}{35053}- Where's my coat?|- Right where you left it.
{35131}{35181}The seams.
{35192}{35264}He can't take his eyes off my legs.
{35266}{35316}Like a nylon lemon peel.
{35318}{35394}Byron couldn't have said it more graciously.
{35396}{35446}Here we go.
{35465}{35558}Got any messages?|What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?
{35560}{35640}Just give him my phone number.|I'll tell him myself.
{35656}{35706}Kill the people.
{35749}{35809}- You gotyour key?|- See you at home.
{35931}{36021}I have a suggestion.|There's really not very much time left.
{36023}{36088}I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet.
{36090}{36196}And I could take care of everything here|and meetyou at the gate with the ticket...
{36198}{36247}if you'd like.
{36249}{36294}I think we'd like very much.
{36296}{36356}- Sure you won't mind?|- Of course not.
{36592}{36693}- She's quite a girl, this whatshername.|- Eve. I'd forgotten they grewthat way.
{36695}{36793}That lack of pretence,|that strange directness and understanding.
{36795}{36859}Did she tell you about|the theatre and what it meant?
{36861}{36919}No, I told her. I sounded off.
{36921}{36992}All the religions in the world rolled into one,
{36994}{37053}and we're gods and goddesses.
{37055}{37167}Isn't it silly? Suddenly I've developed|a big, protective feeling toward her.
{37169}{37234}A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.
{37365}{37470}- Take care of yourself out there.|- They have the Indians pretty well in hand.
{37472}{37577}- Bill, don't get stuck on some glamour puss.|- I'll try.
{37579}{37669}You're not much of a bargain. You're|conceited, thoughtless and messy.
{37671}{37796}- Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.|- You're a setup for some young babe.
{37798}{37859}How childish are you gonna get|before you stop it?
{37861}{37926}I don't wanna be childish.|I'd settle for a few years.
{37928}{37980}And cut that out right now.
{37982}{38056}Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
{38058}{38117}As of this moment, you're six years old.
{38119}{38184}All ready.
{38564}{38618}Thanks for your help. Good luck.
{38620}{38672}Goodbye, Mr Sampson.
{38674}{38744}- Knit me a muffler?|- Call me when you get in.
{39116}{39172}Hey, Junior!
{39181}{39305}Keep your eye on her. Don't let her get Ionely.|She's a loose lamb in a jungle.
{39307}{39357}Don't worry.
{39684}{39801}That same night, we sent for Eve's things...|her few pitiful possessions.
{39803}{39887}She moved into the little guest room|on the top floor.
{39964}{40086}The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,|and I was Cinderella in the last act.
{40088}{40225}Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,|friend, psychiatrist and cop.
{40267}{40316}The honeymoon was on.
{41905}{41964}One more?
{41966}{42016}From now on it isn't applause -
{42018}{42098}just something to do|till the aisles get cleared.
{42142}{42192}What, again?
{42261}{42367}I could watch you play that last scene|a thousand times, cry every time.
{42379}{42461}Performance number 1,000 of this one,|if I play it that long,
{42463}{42543}will take place in a well-padded booby hatch.
{42607}{42712}I must say, you can certainly tell|Mr Sampson's been gone a month.
{42714}{42765}You certainly can.
{42767}{42859}Especially if you're me|between now and tomorrow morning.
{42861}{42939}You bought the new girdles a size smaller.|I can feel it.
{42941}{43001}Something maybe grew a size larger.
{43003}{43086}You can get into one of those girdles|and act for two and a half hours.
{43088}{43175}I couldn't get into the girdle|in two and a half hours.
{43315}{43400}You haven't noticed my latest bit|of interior decorating.
{43402}{43492}But you've done so much. What's new?
{43494}{43554}The curtains. I made them myself.
{43604}{43673}They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
{43675}{43709}Adorable.
{43711}{43811}We now got everything a dressing room|needs except a basketball hoop.
{43813}{43869}Just because you can't even work a zipper!
{43871}{43953}It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.|I appreciate it.
{43955}{44022}I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.
{44024}{44128}- Don't bother. Mrs Brown will be along soon.|- No trouble at all.
{44267}{44332}May I be so bold as to say something?
{44334}{44424}- Have you ever heard of the word "union"?|- Behind in your dues? How much?
{44426}{44509}- I haven't got a union. I'm slave labour.|- Well?
{44511}{44586}But the wardrobe women have got one|and, next to a tenor,
{44588}{44684}a wardrobe woman is the|touchiest thing in show business.
{44703}{44784}She's got two things to do:|carry clothes and press 'em wrong.
{44786}{44864}And don't let anybody try to muscle in.
{45067}{45126}Eve.
{45193}{45273}We'd better let Mrs Brown|pick up the wardrobe.
{45958}{46034}- Hello.|- We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills.
{46036}{46162}- Call? What call?|- Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?
{46164}{46218}Yes, it is, but I don't understand.
{46220}{46342}We are ready with the call you placedfor|12 midnight, California time, to Mr Sampson.
{46344}{46413}- I placed?|- Go ahead, please.
{46415}{46501}Margo, what a wonderful surprise.
{46503}{46582}What a thoughtful, ever-Iovin' thing to do.
{46584}{46671}Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?
{46673}{46736}- You're my girl, aren'tyou?|- That I am.
{46738}{46788}Then you're crazy.
{46821}{46892}- When are you coming back?|- I leave in a week.
{46894}{46961}The picture's wrapped up.|We previewed last night.
{46966}{47017}Oh, those previews.
{47019}{47117}Like opening out of town, but terrifying.|There's nothing you can do.
{47119}{47170}You're trapped. You're in a tin can.
{47182}{47308}In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped|in a Navajo blanket, I wantyou home.
{47319}{47426}- You in a hurry?|- In a big hurry, so be quick about it.
{47443}{47499}Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.
{47501}{47571}Hey, wait a minute.|You haven't even said ityet.
{47593}{47692}Now, Bill. You know how much I do,|but over a phone...
{47694}{47769}Now, really. That's kids' stuff.
{47771}{47861}Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen|every day and I wanna hear it.
{47863}{47937}- And if you won't say it, you can sing it.|- Sing it?
{47939}{48009}Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do.
{48108}{48159}Bill...
{48172}{48232}It's your birthday.
{48234}{48358}And who remembered it?|Who was there on the dot at12 midnight?
{48360}{48407}Happy birthday, darling.
{48409}{48490}The reading could've been better,|but you said it.
{48492}{48546}Now "many happy returns of the day".
{48548}{48618}Many happy returns of the day.
{48640}{48741}- I get a party, don't I?|- Of course. Birthday and coming home.
{48743}{48836}- Who will I ask?|- I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.
{48888}{48949}- She did?|- She hasn't missed a week since I left.
{48951}{49016}But you know that.|You probably tell her what to write.
{49018}{49125}- I sent her a list of guests, so check with her.|- Yeah, I will.
{49127}{49213}- How is Eve? OK?|- OK.
{49215}{49280}- I love you.|- I'll check with Eve.
{49323}{49414}I love you too. Good night, darling.
{49423}{49473}See ya.
{50552}{50602}Birdie.
{50624}{50682}You don't like Eve, do you?
{50684}{50739}You want an argument or an answer?
{50741}{50804}- An answer.|- No.
{50806}{50866}- Why not?|- Now you want an argument.
{50892}{50968}- She works hard.|- Night and day.
{50970}{51075}- She's Ioyal and efficient.|- Like an agent with only one client.
{51119}{51180}She thinks only of me,
{51199}{51249}doesn't she?
{51251}{51335}Well, let's say she thinks|only aboutya, anyway.
{51337}{51409}- How do you mean that?|- I'll tell ya how.
{51431}{51472}Like...
{51474}{51522}Like she's studying you.
{51524}{51601}Like you was a play, or a book,|or a set of blueprints.
{51603}{51656}How you walk, talk, eat, think...
{51658}{51754}I'm sure that's flattering.|There's nothing wrong with it.
{51792}{51893}Good morning. Well, what do|you think of my elegant new suit?
{51895}{51953}It looks much better on you than it did on me.
{51955}{52070}I can imagine. All it needed was|a little taking in here and letting out there.
{52072}{52196}- Are you sure you won't want ityourself?|- Quite sure. I find it too seventeenish for me.
{52198}{52254}Come now, as though you were an old lady.
{52256}{52316}I'm on my way. Is there anything else?
{52318}{52376}- That script to take to the Guild.|- I've got it.
{52378}{52439}And those cheques for the income-tax man.
{52441}{52491}Right here.
{52505}{52583}It seems I can't think of a thing|you haven't thought of.
{52585}{52650}That's my job. See you at teatime.
{52712}{52746}Eve?
{52748}{52883}Did you place a call from me to Bill|for midnight California time?
{52902}{52986}- Golly, I forgot to tell you!|- Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.
{52988}{53056}I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday.
{53058}{53174}You've been so busy lately. Last night|I meant to tell you before you went out.
{53176}{53238}I guess I was asleep when you got home.
{53240}{53320}Yes, I guess you were.|It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
{53329}{53447}Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that.|You'd never forgive me.
{53608}{53695}As a matter of fact,|I sent him a telegram myself.
{54341}{54450}Bill's welcome-home birthday party...|a night to go down in history.
{54452}{54563}Even before the party started,|I could smell disaster in the air.
{54565}{54701}I knew it. I sensed it even as lfinished|dressing for that blasted party.
{54734}{54799}- You all put together?|- My back's open.
{54832}{54897}- Extra help get here?|- There's some characters
{54899}{54992}dressed as maids and butlers.|Did you call the William Morris Agency?
{54994}{55073}You're not funny. Actors would cost less.|How about the food?
{55075}{55138}The caterer had to go back|for the hors d'oeuvres.
{55188}{55257}That French ventriloquist taughtyou a lot.
{55259}{55328}There was nothing he didn't know.
{55447}{55497}There's a message from the bartender.
{55499}{55587}"Does Miss Channing knowthat|she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"
{55589}{55656}The only thing I ordered|by mistake is the guests.
{55658}{55730}They don't care what they drink|as long as it burns.
{55732}{55802}- Where's Bill? He's late.|- Late for what?
{55804}{55907}- Don't be dense. The party.|- I ain't dense. He's been here for 20 minutes.
{55909}{56004}Well, I certainly think it's odd|he hasn't even come up to...
{56445}{56490}The cameraman said:
{56492}{56593}"Even De Mille couldn't see anything|looking through the wrong end!" So...
{56595}{56669}Don't let me kill the point.|Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?
{56671}{56748}You've heard it. I looked through|the wrong end of the camera.
{56750}{56849}Remind me to tell you about the time|I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
{56851}{56958}- I'd like to hear it.|- Some snowy night in front of the fire.
{56960}{57035}Meanwhile, would you check|about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?
{57037}{57116}The caterer forgot them.|The varnish wasn't dry or something.
{57118}{57168}Of course.
{57427}{57481}Looks like I'm going|to have a fancy party.
{57483}{57575}- I thoughtyou were going to be late.|- Well, I'm guest of honour.
{57577}{57626}I had no idea you were even here.
{57628}{57704}I ran into Eve|and she told me you were dressing.
{57706}{57766}That's never stopped you before.
{57801}{57888}She wanted to know about Hollywood.|She seemed so interested...
{57890}{57988}- She's a girl of so many interests.|- It's a pretty rare quality these days.
{57990}{58073}- A girl of so many rare qualities.|- So she seems.
{58075}{58130}So you've pointed out so often.
{58132}{58181}So many qualities so often.
{58183}{58286}Her Ioyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth|and affection, and so young.
{58288}{58338}So young and so fair.
{58384}{58439}I can't believe you're making this up.
{58441}{58516}It sounds like something|out of an old Clyde Fitch play.
{58518}{58611}Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,|was well before my time.
{58613}{58716}I always deny thatyou were in Our American|Cousin the night Lincoln was shot.
{58718}{58790}- I don't thinkthat's funny.|- Of course it is.
{58792}{58854}This is all too laughable to be anything else.
{58856}{58915}You know what I feel|about your age obsession.
{58917}{59032}And this getting into a jealous froth because|I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid.
{59034}{59092}- 20!|- 30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?
{59094}{59154}Stage-struck. She's a young lady of qualities.
{59156}{59252}And I'm fed up with both|the young lady and her qualities.
{59254}{59336}Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint.
{59338}{59410}How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.
{59412}{59505}How can you take offence at a kid|trying to be like her ideal?
{59507}{59567}Stop calling her a kid.
{59611}{59695}As it happens, there are|particular aspects of my life
{59697}{59798}to which I would like to maintain|sole and exclusive rights and privileges.
{59805}{59878}- For instance, what?|- For instance, you.
{59934}{60026}This is my cue to take you|in my arms and reassure you.
{60028}{60073}But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.
{60075}{60112}- Guilty!|- Mad!
{60114}{60215}There are certain characteristics|for which you are famous, on stage and off.
{60217}{60324}I love you for some and in spite of others.|I haven't let those become too important.
{60326}{60438}They're part of your equipment for getting|along in what is called "our environment".
{60440}{60502}You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right.
{60504}{60575}But I will not have you|sharpen them on me, or on Eve.
{60577}{60686}- What about her teeth? Her fangs?|- She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!
{60688}{60763}So when you start judging|an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid
{60765}{60890}by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards of|this megalomaniac society, I won't have it!
{60892}{60978}Eve Harrington has never by word,|look, thought or suggestion
{60980}{61090}indicated anything to me but adoration|for you and happiness at our being in love.
{61092}{61210}To intimate anything else spells a paranoiac|insecurity thatyou should be ashamed of.
{61212}{61332}Cut. Print it. What happens in the next reel?|Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?
{61334}{61384}Miss Channing?
{61440}{61536}The hors d'oeuvres are here.|Is there anything else I can do?
{61625}{61715}Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.
{61717}{61767}I'll get it.
{61823}{61876}- What'll you have?|- A milk shake?
{61903}{61963}A martini, very dry, please.
{62066}{62138}- The party's on the first floor.|- Hi, Bill.
{62140}{62197}- Hello, Mrs Richards.|- How are you, dear?
{62199}{62267}Good evening, Mr Richards. Mr Fabian.
{62269}{62325}- May I have your coat?|- I'll take it up.
{62327}{62377}- Please.|- Thank you.
{62390}{62440}- Hi.|- Hi, Margo.
{62452}{62527}- The house looks lovely.|- I like that girl.
{62529}{62580}That quality of quiet graciousness.
{62582}{62650}Among so many quiet qualities.
{62652}{62698}Shall we?
{62707}{62825}- It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.|- I'm so happy you're happy.
{62827}{62950}You haven't been running a settlement house|exactly. The kid has earned her way.
{62952}{63017}You had a mixed-up inventory|when she took over.
{63019}{63074}Merchandise laying all over the shop.
{63076}{63170}- You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.|- Make it Bergdorf Goodman.
{63172}{63265}Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?|All done up in little ribbons.
{63267}{63338}I could die right now|and nobody'd be confused.
{63340}{63395}- How aboutyou, Max?|- How about me what?
{63397}{63472}Suppose you dropped dead.|What aboutyour inventory?
{63474}{63576}I ain't going to drop dead. Not with the heat.
{63578}{63645}This is the most ghoulish conversation.
{63647}{63698}- Thank you.|- Nothing.
{63700}{63748}Max!
{63750}{63808}Fife!
{63810}{63917}"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless|you'd like to take her drink up to her.
{63919}{64010}I can get a fresh one...|Karen, you're a Gibson girl.
{64017}{64080}The general atmosphere is very Macbethish.
{64082}{64157}- What has or is about to happen?|- What is he talking about?
{64159}{64242}- Macbeth.|- We've seen you like this before.
{64244}{64304}Is it over or is it just beginning?
{64536}{64635}Fasten your seat belts.|It's going to be a bumpy night.
{64679}{64736}- Margo, darling!|- How are you?
{64807}{64885}Enchantée to you too.
{64897}{64992}I remember, Addison, crossing you off|my guest list. What are you doing here?
{64994}{65098}Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable|Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.
{65100}{65161}- Remember Miss Caswell?|- I do not. How do you do?
{65163}{65239}- We've never met. Maybe that's why.|- She is an actress.
{65241}{65321}A graduate of the Copacabana|School of Dramatic Art.
{65378}{65403}Eve.
{65405}{65486}- Good evening, Mr DeWitt.|- I had no idea you knew each other.
{65488}{65555}This must be, at long last,|our formal introduction.
{65557}{65673}- Until now, we've only met in passing.|- That's how you met me. In passing.
{65675}{65734}Eve, this is an old friend|of Mr DeWitt's mother.
{65736}{65819}- Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington.|- How do you do?
{65821}{65890}I've been wanting you|to meet Eve for the longest time.
{65892}{65966}Your timidity must have|kept you from mentioning it.
{65968}{66050}- You know of her interest in the theatre?|- We have that in common.
{66052}{66098}Then you two must have a long talk.
{66100}{66173}I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find me|boring before too long.
{66175}{66259}You won't bore him, honey.|You won't even get a chance to talk.
{66261}{66311}Claudia, come here.
{66358}{66430}You see that man?|That's Max Fabian, the producer.
{66432}{66488}Now, go and do yourself some good.
{66490}{66556}Why do they always look|like unhappy rabbits?
{66558}{66648}Cos that's what they are.|Now go and make him happier.
{66713}{66818}Now, don't worry aboutyour little charge.|She'll be in safe hands.
{67077}{67127}Amen!
{68149}{68234}- Liebestraum.|- I just played it.
{68236}{68315}- Play it again.|- But that was the fourth straight time.
{68317}{68371}Then this will be five.
{68439}{68548}Many of your guests are wondering when|they may be permitted to viewthe body.
{68550}{68652}- Where has it been laid out?|- It hasn't been laid out.
{68654}{68732}We haven't finished with the embalming.
{68734}{68806}As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.
{68808}{68876}The remains of Margo Channing...
{68898}{68948}sitting up.
{68950}{69034}It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
{69036}{69096}Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
{69098}{69203}You know nothing about feelings,|natural or unnatural.
{69205}{69292}Your guests were also wondering|whether the music couldn't be
{69294}{69374}a shade more on the...|shall we say, happier side?
{69376}{69511}If my guests do not like it here,|I suggest they accompany you to the nursery
{69513}{69605}where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
{69607}{69726}Margo, you by any chance haven't got|any bicarbonate of soda in the house?
{69728}{69808}Poor Max. Heartburn?
{69837}{69892}It's that Miss Caswell.
{69894}{69970}I don't see why she hasn't|given Addison heartburn.
{69972}{70108}- No heart to burn.|- Everybody has a heart, except some people.
{70134}{70188}Of course I've got bicarb.
{70190}{70250}I've got a box in the pantry.
{70252}{70338}We'll putyour name on it. "Max Fabian."
{70340}{70446}It will stay there always, just for you.
{70472}{70554}Let the rest of the world|beat their brains out for a buck.
{70556}{70607}It's friends that count.
{70609}{70725}- And I have friends.|- I love you, Max. I really mean it.
{70727}{70781}I love you.
{70783}{70838}Come to the pantry.
{70854}{70929}She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.
{71303}{71353}There you are, Maxie dear.
{71355}{71430}One good burp|and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell.
{71432}{71518}The situation I'm in ain't the kind|you can belch your way out of.
{71520}{71602}- I made a promise.|- To Miss Caswell? What?
{71604}{71669}For an audition for this part we are replacing.
{71671}{71720}What's her name? Your sister?
{71722}{71779}- One?|- No, two, please.
{71781}{71837}If she can act, she might not be bad.
{71839}{71914}She looks like she might|burn down a plantation.
{71916}{71984}Right now, I feel like|there is one burning in me.
{71986}{72057}- When's the audition?|- A couple of weeks.
{72059}{72148}Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
{72150}{72240}- Would you?|- Anything to help you out, Max.
{72242}{72315}Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.
{72317}{72408}Not at all. And now you|can do me a great favour.
{72410}{72461}Just name it.
{72463}{72543}Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.
{72631}{72693}You get quick action, don'tyou?
{72695}{72765}I wouldn't think of taking|that girl away from you.
{72767}{72881}You said yourself my inventory was in shape,|all my merchandise put away.
{72883}{72969}To keep her here with nothing to do,|I'd be standing in her way.
{72971}{73041}- And you need her, Max.|- What will she do?
{73043}{73111}She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,
{73113}{73221}interview people you have to see,|get rid of those you don't have to.
{73223}{73285}You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.
{73287}{73344}- Well...|- Think of your health.
{73346}{73431}More time to relax|in the fresh air at a racetrack.
{73433}{73519}- I don't think it's such a good idea.|- Promise?
{73521}{73571}- Promise.|- That's my Max.
{73612}{73655}There you both are.
{73657}{73710}Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.
{73712}{73775}- Where is she now?|- Up in your room.
{73777}{73857}If you'll excuse me,|I'll go and tell Miss Caswell.
{73949}{74009}- Who's left out there?|- Too many.
{74011}{74095}And, besides, you got a new guest.|A movie star from Hollywood.
{74097}{74210}Shucks! And I sent|my autograph bookto the cleaners.
{74306}{74375}You disapprove of me|when I'm like this, don'tyou?
{74377}{74489}Not exactly. Sometimes, though,|I wish I understood you better.
{74491}{74551}- When you do, let me in on it.|- I will.
{74599}{74703}- How's the new one coming?|- The play? Oh, all right, I guess.
{74727}{74809}Cora. Still a girl of 20?
{74811}{74861}20-ish. It's not important.
{74863}{74930}Don't you think it's about time|it became important?
{74932}{75008}- How do you mean?|- Don't be evasive.
{75010}{75069}Margo, you haven't got any age.
{75071}{75159}Miss Channing is ageless.|Spoken like a press agent.
{75161}{75229}I know what I'm talking about.|They're my plays.
{75231}{75281}Spoken like an author.
{75303}{75382}Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.
{75384}{75452}Three months ago I was 40 years old.
{75454}{75516}40! Four-0.
{75582}{75700}That slipped out.|I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.
{75742}{75836}Now I suddenly feel as if|I've taken all my clothes off.
{75909}{75980}To thousands of people|you're as young as you want.
{75982}{76048}As young as they want, you mean.
{76050}{76143}I'm not interested whether thousands|of people think I'm six or 600.
{76145}{76205}Just one person, isn't that so?
{76275}{76392}You know what this is all about. It has little|to do with whether you should play Cora.
{76394}{76469}It has everything to do with|you having a fight with Bill.
{76471}{76545}Bill's 32. He looks 32.
{76547}{76655}He looked it five years ago.|He'll look it 20 years from now.
{76657}{76707}I hate men.
{76771}{76839}Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.
{76841}{76944}I'll wear rompers and come in|rolling a hoop, if you like.
{77037}{77127}Who'd show up at this hour?|It's time people went home.
{77182}{77232}Hold that coat up.
{77304}{77384}- Whose is it?|- Some Hollywood movie star.
{77386}{77467}- Her plane got in late.|- Discouraging, isn't it?
{77469}{77550}Women with furs like that|where it never even gets cold.
{77552}{77602}Hollywood.
{77662}{77748}Tell me, Eve. How are things|going with you? Happy?
{77750}{77804}There should be a new word for happiness.
{77806}{77896}Being here with Miss Channing|has been a... I just can't say.
{77898}{77981}She's been so wonderful,|done so much for me.
{78015}{78152}Lloyd says Margo compensates for|underplaying on stage by overplaying reality.
{78177}{78273}Next to that sable, my new mink|seems like an old bed jacket.
{78275}{78405}You've done your share, Eve. You've|worked wonders with Margo. Good night.
{78407}{78475}- Mrs Richards?|- Karen.
{78477}{78524}Karen.
{78526}{78613}Isn't it awful? I'm about|to ask you for another favour,
{78615}{78663}after all you've done already.
{78665}{78711}Nobody's done so much.
{78713}{78801}Stop thinking of yourself|as one of the hundred neediest cases.
{78803}{78902}- What is it?|- Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,
{78904}{78979}so there isn't enough|to keep me as busy as I should be.
{78981}{79061}Not that I'd consider anything|that would take me away from her.
{79063}{79149}But the other day|when Mr Fabian told Miss Channing
{79151}{79260}that her understudy was going to have|a baby and they'd have to replace her...
{79262}{79376}- You wanna be Margo's new understudy?|- I don't let myself think about it even.
{79378}{79464}But I do knowthe part so well,|and every bit of the staging,
{79466}{79536}there'd be no need to break in a new girl.
{79563}{79628}Suppose I had to go on one night
{79630}{79709}to an audience that came|to see Margo Channing.
{79711}{79796}- I couldn't possibly.|- I wouldn't worry too much about that.
{79798}{79933}Margo just doesn't miss performances.|If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.
{79935}{80043}- The show must go on.|- No, dear. Margo must go on.
{80045}{80121}I don't see any reason|why you shouldn't be her understudy.
{80123}{80209}- You think Miss Channing would approve?|- I think she'd cheer.
{80211}{80315}- But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson?|- They'll do as they're told.
{80335}{80414}Then... would you speak|to Mr Fabian about it?
{80416}{80483}- Of course.|- You won't forget?
{80490}{80540}I won't forget.
{80596}{80689}I seem to be forever|thanking you for something, don't I?
{80880}{80951}The bed looks like a dead animal act.
{80953}{81036}- Which one is sable?|- But she just got here.
{81038}{81124}Well, she's on her way|with half the men in the joint.
{81126}{81213}- It's only a fur coat.|- What do you expect? Live sable?
{81215}{81315}Diamond collar, gold sleeves.|You know - picture people.
{81350}{81431}Elder statesmen of the theatre or cinema
{81433}{81541}assure the public that actors|and actresses are just plain folks,
{81543}{81629}ignoring the fact that their greatest|attraction to the public
{81631}{81719}is their complete lack of resemblance|to normal human beings.
{81721}{81803}Now there's something|a girl could make sacrifices for.
{81805}{81865}- And probably has.|- Sable.
{81867}{81951}- Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?|- Either one.
{81953}{82029}We all have abnormality in common.
{82031}{82123}We're a breed apart from the rest|of humanity, we theatre folk.
{82125}{82203}We are the original displaced personalities.
{82205}{82297}You won't have to read his column|tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.
{82299}{82403}- I don't agree, Addison.|- That's your particular abnormality.
{82405}{82471}I admit there's a screwball|element in the theatre.
{82473}{82570}It sticks out, it's got spotlights|on it and a brass band.
{82572}{82696}But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.|If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.
{82698}{82804}- Waiter.|- That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
{82806}{82864}Well, I can'tyell out "butler", can I?
{82866}{82928}Maybe somebody's name is Butler.
{82930}{83017}You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
{83019}{83114}I don't wanna make trouble.|All I want is a drink.
{83116}{83207}- Leave it to me. I'll getyou one.|- Thank you, Mr Fabian.
{83226}{83339}Well done. I can see your career|rising in the east like the sun.
{83392}{83497}- You were saying?|- The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.
{83507}{83613}Work done the hard way - by sweat,|application and craftsmanship.
{83621}{83704}To be a good actor or actress,|or anything in the theatre,
{83706}{83774}means wanting to be that|more than anything else.
{83776}{83830}Yes. Yes, it does.
{83832}{83923}It means a concentration|of desire or ambition and sacrifice
{83925}{83980}such as no other profession demands.
{83982}{84075}And the man or woman who accepts|those terms can't be ordinary,
{84077}{84129}can't be just someone.
{84131}{84202}To give so much for almost always so little.
{84204}{84259}"So little"?
{84261}{84313}"So little", did you say?
{84340}{84424}Why, if there's nothing else,|there's applause.
{84426}{84505}I've listened backstage to people applaud.
{84507}{84553}It's like...
{84555}{84672}Like waves of love coming over|the footlights and wrapping you up.
{84674}{84804}Imagine - to know every night|that different hundreds of people love you.
{84806}{84907}They smile, their eyes shine,|you've pleased them.
{84909}{84984}They wantyou. You belong.
{85020}{85092}Just that alone is worth anything.
{85424}{85536}Don't get up. And please stop acting|as if I were the Queen Mother.
{85538}{85609}- I'm sorry, I didn't...|- Outside of a beehive, Margo,
{85611}{85687}your behaviour is hardly queenly or motherly.
{85689}{85739}You're in a beehive, pal.
{85741}{85852}We're all busy little bees, full of stings,|making honey day and night.
{85854}{85905}- Aren't we, honey?|- Margo, really.
{85913}{85976}Please don't play governess, Karen.
{85978}{86062}I haven'tyour unyielding good taste.
{86064}{86176}I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,|but Father wouldn't hear of it.
{86178}{86244}He needed help behind a notions counter.
{86246}{86345}I'm being rude now, aren't I?|Or should I say, ain't I?
{86353}{86442}You're maudlin and full of self-pity.|You're magnificent.
{86444}{86503}How about calling it a night?
{86505}{86567}And you pose as a playwright.
{86569}{86680}A situation pregnant with possibilities,|and all you can think of is "go to sleep".
{86688}{86762}- It's a good thought.|- It won't play.
{86780}{86882}As a nonprofessional,|I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.
{86901}{86975}Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.
{86977}{87045}- Happy little housewife.|- Cut it out.
{87047}{87165}This is my house, not a theatre.|In my house you're a guest, not a director.
{87167}{87259}Then stop being a star and treating|your guests as your supporting cast.
{87261}{87325}- Let's not get into a big hassle.|- It's time we did.
{87327}{87427}Margo has to realise what's attractive|on stage need not be attractive off.
{87429}{87489}All right!
{87491}{87542}I'm going to bed.
{87714}{87824}You be host. It's your party.|Happy birthday. Welcome home.
{87826}{87889}And we who are about to die salute you.
{87891}{87941}Need any help?
{88072}{88167}To put me to bed?|Take my clothes off, hold my head?
{88188}{88274}Tuck me in, turn out the lights|and tiptoe out?
{88315}{88373}Eve would, wouldn'tyou, Eve?
{88375}{88438}- If you'd like.|- I wouldn't like.
{88620}{88680}- I forgot I had it.|- I didn't.
{88856}{88940}Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.
{88942}{89002}They're gonna play it offstage.
{89074}{89134}- Coming, Max?|- In a minute.
{89209}{89313}Eve, you mustn't mind Margo|too much, even if I do.
{89315}{89396}There must be some reason,|something I've done without knowing.
{89398}{89492}The reason is Margo and don't try|to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
{89494}{89555}But if I thought I'd offended her,|of all people...
{89557}{89693}Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.|But I know Margo. And every now and then,
{89695}{89818}there is nothing I wanna do so much|as kick her right square in the pants.
{89820}{89882}Well, if she has to pick on someone,
{89884}{89944}I'd just as soon it was me.
{90017}{90070}- Max is gonna drop us.|- Good night.
{90072}{90124}- Good night.|- Good night.
{90126}{90242}Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you?|What we talked about before?
{90244}{90294}No, Eve. I won't forget.
{90930}{90977}Why so remote, Addison?
{90979}{91065}You should be at the side of|your protégée, lending her moral support.
{91067}{91165}Miss Caswell is where I can|lend no support, moral or otherwise.
{91167}{91220}In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?
{91222}{91278}Being violently ill to her tummy.
{91280}{91339}It's good luck before an audition.
{91341}{91416}Miss Caswell got lucky too late.|The audition is over.
{91418}{91508}It can't be. I came here to read|with Miss Caswell. I promised Max.
{91510}{91571}The audition was at 2.30.|It's now nearly four.
{91573}{91662}Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.|I never have, you know.
{91664}{91720}Who read with Miss Caswell?
{91722}{91785}- Bill? Lloyd?|- No.
{91787}{91878}- Well, it can't have been Max. Who?|- Naturally, your understudy.
{91880}{91966}It's unnatural to allow a girl|in an advanced state of pregnancy...
{91968}{92087}I refer to your new and unpregnant|understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.
{92089}{92153}Eve? My understudy?
{92155}{92245}- Didn'tyou know?|- Of course I knew.
{92247}{92297}It just slipped your mind?
{92387}{92450}How... was Miss Caswell?
{92465}{92518}Frankly, I don't remember.
{92520}{92583}- Just slipped your mind?|- Completely.
{92585}{92665}Nor can anyone else present|tell you how Miss Caswell read,
{92667}{92739}or whether Miss Caswell read|or rode a pogo stick.
{92741}{92794}Was she that bad?
{92810}{92907}Margo, I have lived in the theatre|as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.
{92909}{92974}I have no other world, no other life.
{92976}{93050}Once in a great while,|I experience that moment of revelation
{93052}{93126}for which all true believers|wait and pray. You were one.
{93128}{93269}Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,|Hayes. There are others, three or four.
{93271}{93326}Eve Harrington will be among them.
{93328}{93379}I take it she read well.
{93381}{93438}It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.
{93440}{93527}Brilliant, vivid,|something made of music and fire.
{93529}{93580}How nice.
{93582}{93651}In time, she'll be whatyou are.
{93653}{93713}A mass of music and fire.
{93730}{93815}That's me. An old kazoo with some sparklers.
{93874}{93961}Tell me, was... Bill swept away too?
{93963}{94067}- Or were you too full of revelation to notice?|- Bill didn't say.
{94069}{94188}But Lloyd listened to his play as if|it had been written by someone else, he said.
{94190}{94269}It sounded so fresh,|so new, so full of meaning.
{94284}{94388}How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.|How nice for everybody.
{94403}{94503}Eve was incredibly modest.|She insisted that no credit was due her.
{94505}{94607}That Lloyd felt as he did because she read|his lines exactly as he'd written them.
{94609}{94686}The implication being|that I did not read them as written?
{94688}{94796}Neither your name nor your performance|entered the conversation.
{94953}{95003}Feeling better, my dear?
{95053}{95158}Like I just swam the English Channel.|Now what?
{95160}{95260}Your next move, it seems to me,|should be towards television.
{95345}{95436}Tell me this.|Do they have auditions for television?
{95438}{95534}That's all television is, my dear.|Nothing but auditions.
{95649}{95699}Margo, darling.
{95971}{96066}Terribly sorry I was late.|Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.
{96068}{96149}- Where's Miss Caswell? Oh, hello, Eve.|- Hello, Miss Channing.
{96151}{96214}How are you making out|in Mr Fabian's office?
{96216}{96326}Now, Max, I don't wantyou working this child|too hard just because you promised.
{96328}{96403}As you see, I kept my promise, too.
{96405}{96460}It's all over.
{96462}{96536}- What's all over?|- The audition.
{96538}{96651}- Eve read with Miss Caswell.|- Eve? How enchanting.
{96653}{96735}How did you get the idea of letting|Eve read with Miss Caswell?
{96737}{96838}- Well, she's your understudy.|- Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.
{96840}{96894}I thoughtyou knew. She started a week ago.
{96896}{97046}I've never seen her backstage, but with|so many people loitering about... Well, well.
{97048}{97113}So Eve is not working for Max, after all.
{97140}{97200}Max, you sly puss.
{97252}{97371}Miss Channing, I can't tell you|how glad I am thatyou arrived so late.
{97373}{97473}- Really, Eve? Why?|- Otherwise, I never would have dared to read.
{97475}{97536}- Why not?|- If you'd come in the middle,
{97538}{97588}I couldn't have gone on.
{97590}{97686}What a pity.|All that fire and music being turned off.
{97688}{97749}- What fire and music?|- You wouldn't understand.
{97751}{97801}How was Miss Caswell?
{97803}{97854}Back to the Copacabana.
{97856}{97921}But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.
{97923}{98057}I was dreadful, Miss Channing. I have no right|to be anyone's understudy, much less yours.
{98059}{98124}I'm sure you underestimate yourself.|You always do.
{98126}{98174}You were about to tell me about Eve.
{98176}{98226}- You'd have been proud of her.|- I'm sure.
{98228}{98292}- She was a revelation.|- To you too?
{98294}{98375}- What do you mean by that?|- It must have been a revelation
{98377}{98470}to have a 24-year-old character|played by a 24-year-old actress.
{98472}{98531}- That's beside the point.|- It is the point.
{98533}{98589}It must have seemed so new and fresh to you,
{98591}{98670}so exciting, to have your lines|read just as you wrote them.
{98672}{98750}- Addison.|- So full of meaning, fire and music.
{98788}{98853}You've talked to that|venomous fishwife DeWitt.
{98855}{98923}In this case, as trustworthy|as the world almanac.
{98925}{98999}You knew when you came in|that Eve was your understudy.
{99001}{99061}Playing that childish game of cat and mouse.
{99063}{99140}Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.
{99142}{99258}Your genius for making a bar-room brawl|out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding.
{99260}{99326}Perfectly innocent?|Men have been hanged for less.
{99328}{99386}I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,
{99388}{99465}accused of reading your play|as if it were the holy gospel.
{99467}{99510}I never said it was.
{99512}{99616}You listen as if someone else had written|your play. Whom do you have in mind?
{99619}{99697}Arthur Miller? Sherwood?|Beaumont and Fletcher?
{99699}{99759}- May I say a word?|- No!
{99781}{99882}You think Miller or Sherwood would stand|for the nonsense I take from you?
{99884}{99987}Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.|They've been dead for 300 years!
{100006}{100080}All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!
{100100}{100210}That would solve none of their problems|because actresses never die!
{100310}{100395}The stars never die and never change.
{100403}{100463}You may change this star any time you want
{100465}{100567}for a new and fresh and exciting one,|fully equipped with fire and music.
{100569}{100668}Any time you want,|starting with tonight's performance.
{100670}{100720}This is for lawyers to talk about.
{100722}{100813}This concerns a contract|that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.
{100815}{100920}Are you threatening me|with legal action, Mr Fabian?
{100932}{101030}- Are you breaking the contract?|- Answer my question.
{101032}{101131}- Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.|- I don't hear you.
{101133}{101227}- I said I'm a dying man!|- Not until the last drugstore
{101229}{101294}has sold its last pill.
{101296}{101386}I shall never understand the process|by which a body with a voice
{101388}{101447}suddenly fancies itself as a mind.
{101449}{101509}Just when does an actress decide
{101511}{101597}they're her words she's saying|and her thoughts she's expressing?
{101599}{101686}Usually at the point|when she has to rewrite and rethinkthem
{101688}{101752}to keep the audience from leaving the theatre.
{101754}{101871}It's about time the piano realised|it has not written the concerto!
{101992}{102155}And you, I take it, are the Paderewski|who plays his concerto on me, the piano?
{102198}{102260}Where is Princess Fire and Music?
{102262}{102322}- Who?|- The kid. Junior.
{102455}{102529}- Gone.|- I must have frightened her away.
{102531}{102601}I wouldn't be surprised.|Sometimes you frighten me.
{102603}{102685}Poor little flower.|Dropped her petals and folded her tent.
{102687}{102767}- Don't mix your metaphors.|- I'll mix what I like!
{102769}{102845}I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
{102847}{102906}What a body. What a voice.
{102924}{103021}That ex ship-news reporter.|No body, no voice, all mind.
{103025}{103133}- The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down.|- I will not calm down.
{103135}{103195}Don't calm down.
{103259}{103365}- You're being terribly tolerant, aren'tyou?|- I'm trying terribly hard.
{103367}{103475}Well, you needn't be. I will not be|tolerated and I will not be plotted against.
{103477}{103555}- Here we go.|- Such nonsense. What do you take me for?
{103557}{103666}Little Nell from the country? Been my|understudy for a week without me knowing it.
{103668}{103742}- Carefully hidden, no doubt.|- Don't get carried away.
{103744}{103829}Arrives here for an audition|when everyone knows I will be here,
{103831}{103947}- and gives a performance out of nowhere.|- You've been all through that with Lloyd.
{103949}{104048}The playwright doesn't make the|performance. It doesn't just happen.
{104050}{104120}Full of fire and music and whatnot.
{104122}{104180}Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.
{104182}{104248}Full of those Bill Sampson touches.
{104250}{104334}- I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.|- Paranoiac?
{104336}{104411}I didn't know Eve was|your understudy until this afternoon.
{104413}{104552}- Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it.|- No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.
{104554}{104662}Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of us|by these paranoiac tantrums.
{104664}{104752}- That word. I don't even know what it means.|- It's time you found out.
{104754}{104817}I love you. I love you.
{104819}{104892}- You're beautiful and intelligent.|- A body with a voice.
{104894}{104985}A beautiful and an intelligent woman,|and a great actress.
{105011}{105110}A great actress at the peak of her career.|You have every reason for happiness.
{105112}{105158}- Except happiness.|- Every reason.
{105160}{105273}But due to some uncontrollable drive,|you permit the slightest action of a kid...
{105275}{105369}- A kid!|- ..a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.
{105371}{105427}Now, once and for all, stop it.
{105856}{105916}It's obvious you're not a woman.
{105938}{106037}- I've been aware of that for some time.|- Well, I am.
{106039}{106089}I'll say.
{106101}{106151}Don't be condescending.
{106153}{106213}Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
{106215}{106340}I may have seen better days, but I'm|still not to be had for the price of a cocktail.
{106342}{106392}Like a salted peanut.
{106419}{106532}- Margo, let's make peace.|- The terms are too high.
{106534}{106641}Just being happy? Just stopping|all this nonsense about Eve?
{106643}{106707}- And Eve and me?|- It's not nonsense.
{106709}{106811}But if I tell you it is, as I just did...|were you listening to me?
{106848}{106941}- Isn't that enough?|- I wish it were.
{106943}{107005}Then what would be enough?
{107007}{107063}If we got married?
{107065}{107143}I wouldn't wantyou to marry me|just to prove something.
{107145}{107234}You've had so many reasons|for not wanting to marry me.
{107263}{107344}Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
{107346}{107394}I don't know, Bill.
{107396}{107454}It's just a feeling. I don't know.
{107456}{107504}I think you do know.
{107506}{107571}But you won't or can't tell me.
{107605}{107715}I said before it was gonna be|my last try, and I meant it.
{107717}{107802}I can't think of anything else to do.|I wish I could.
{107834}{107913}We usually wind up screaming|as the curtain comes down.
{107915}{107979}Then it comes up again and everything's fine.
{107981}{108031}But not this time.
{108079}{108146}No playwright in the world|could make me believe
{108148}{108228}this would happen between two adult people.
{108261}{108311}Goodbye, Margo.
{108457}{108511}Bill?
{108551}{108610}Where are you going?
{108612}{108667}To find Eve?
{108707}{108792}That suddenly makes|the whole thing believable.
{109327}{109377}Lloyd.
{109400}{109492}- Lloyd, what's happened?|- Up to here, that's where I've got it.
{109494}{109561}Of all the star-ridden,|presumptuous, hysterical...
{109563}{109608}- Margo again.|- And again and again.
{109610}{109687}- Two hours late for the audition.|- That's on time for Margo.
{109689}{109783}And then a childish routine about|not knowing Eve was her understudy.
{109785}{109841}- It's possible she didn't.|- She knew.
{109843}{109940}Addison told her how superbly|Eve had read the part.
{109942}{110044}Karen, let me tell you about Eve.|She's got everything. A born actress.
{110046}{110157}- Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting...|- You'll run out of adjectives, dear.
{110159}{110240}Everything a playwright first thinks|of wanting to write about,
{110242}{110314}until his play becomes|a vehicle for Miss Channing.
{110316}{110364}Margo hasn't done badly by it.
{110366}{110435}Margo's great.|She knows it, that's the trouble.
{110437}{110515}She can play Peck's Bad Boy|all she wants and who's to stop her?
{110517}{110617}Who's to give her that boot|in the rear she needs and deserves?
{110651}{110718}It's gonna be a cosy weekend.
{110720}{110794}- What is?|- We're driving to the country tomorrow.
{110796}{110876}Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.
{110878}{110970}Well, we've spent weekends|before with nobody talking.
{110972}{111083}Just be sure to lock up|all blunt instruments and throwable objects.
{111158}{111278}Newton, they say, thought of gravity|by getting hit on the head by an apple.
{111280}{111388}And the man who invented the steam-engine,|he was watching a teakettle.
{111390}{111502}But not me. My big idea came|to me just sitting on a couch.
{111528}{111623}That boot in the rear to Margo.|Heaven knows, she had one coming.
{111625}{111728}From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,|Bill, Max and so on.
{111730}{111813}We'd allfelt those size fives|of hers often enough.
{111815}{111901}But how? The answer was|buzzing around me like a fly.
{111923}{111973}I had it.
{111975}{112076}But I let it go.|Screaming and calling names is one thing,
{112078}{112128}but this could mean...
{112172}{112276}Why not? "Why"I said to myself"not?"
{112278}{112402}It would all seem perfectly legitimate.|And only two people in the world would know.
{112404}{112502}Also, the boot would land where|it would do the most goodfor all concerned.
{112504}{112574}After all, it was no more than a harmless joke
{112576}{112650}which Margo herself|would be the first to enjoy.
{112652}{112752}And no reason why she shouldn't|be told about it... in time.
{112944}{113052}Hello. Will you please call|Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?
{113086}{113136}Not at all. I'll wait.
{113184}{113274}It was a cold weekend, outside and in.
{113276}{113321}Bill didn't come at all.
{113323}{113438}Margo didn't know where he was|and didn't care... she kept saying.
{113440}{113501}Somehow we staggered through Sunday,
{113503}{113595}and by the time we drove Margo|to the station late Monday afternoon,
{113597}{113719}she and Lloyd had thawed out|to the extent of being civil to each other.
{113721}{113821}- What time is it?|- When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.
{113823}{113899}It is now 5.43.|When you ask again a minute from now...
{113901}{114006}I just don't want Margo to miss her train.|As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.
{114008}{114099}5.55. We'll be at the station in plenty of time.
{114101}{114190}That little place|" just two hours from New York".
{114192}{114321}It's on my list of things I'll never understand,|like collecting shrunken Indian heads.
{114323}{114405}You should know what it means|to want a little peace and quiet.
{114407}{114473}Peace and quiet is for libraries.
{114475}{114527}Lloyd. Please.
{114529}{114619}Just a little skid, that's all.|This road's like glass.
{114621}{114720}- Karen and I just don't want an accident.|- I don't intend to have an accident.
{114722}{114825}It isn't important whether you do.|We are wearing long underwear.
{114877}{114927}Now what's this?
{115303}{115356}But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.
{115358}{115471}I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full|when you drove to Brewster this morning?
{115473}{115557}I didn't look. You know|I don't pay attention to those things.
{115559}{115596}Just incredible.
{115598}{115673}- How much time have we got?|- Roughly ten minutes.
{115675}{115746}- Howfar is the station?|- About three or four miles.
{115748}{115852}- Any houses where we can borrow gas?|- There's not much along this back road.
{115854}{115933}Not many cars either.|Not much chance of a lift.
{115935}{116035}No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna|walk up about half a mile, just in case.
{116466}{116533}- You want it on?|- It doesn't matter.
{116546}{116601}I detest cheap sentiment.
{116753}{116813}Karen?
{116815}{116843}No, thank you.
{116845}{116957}- I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.|- We've all been a little tense lately.
{116959}{117080}Come to think of it, I haven't been very|pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry.
{117082}{117177}More than any two people I know, I don't|want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.
{117179}{117275}We're never deeply angry.|We just get mad the way you do.
{117277}{117327}We know you too well.
{117329}{117391}So many people know me.
{117393}{117468}I wish I did.|I wish someone would tell me about me.
{117475}{117541}You're Margo. Just... Margo.
{117556}{117673}And what is that? Besides something|spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.
{117675}{117813}Besides a temperament, which consists|mostly of swooping about on a broomstick
{117815}{117871}and screaming at the top of my voice.
{117873}{117933}Infants behave the way I do, you know.
{117935}{118040}They carry on and misbehave.|They'd get drunk if they knew how,
{118042}{118110}when they can't have what they want.
{118112}{118190}When they feel unwanted or insecure or...
{118211}{118257}unloved.
{118295}{118377}- What about Bill?|- What about Bill?
{118379}{118419}He's in love with you.
{118421}{118536}More than anything in this world,|I love Bill. And I want Bill.
{118538}{118588}And I want him to want me.
{118590}{118640}But me, not Margo Channing.
{118665}{118735}And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?
{118753}{118813}Well, why should he and why should you?
{118815}{118933}Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's|fought with her, worked with her, loved her.
{118935}{119038}But ten years from now|Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.
{119040}{119127}And what's left will be... what?
{119153}{119232}Margo, Bill is all of|eight years younger than you.
{119234}{119355}Those years stretch as the years go on.|I've seen it happen too often.
{119357}{119411}Not to you, not to Bill.
{119413}{119480}Isn't that what they always say?
{119597}{119665}I don't suppose the heater runs|if the motor doesn't.
{119667}{119801}Silly, isn't it? You'd thinkthey'd fix it so|people could just sit in a car and keep warm.
{119819}{119876}About Eve.
{119878}{119959}I've acted pretty disgracefully|toward her too.
{119983}{120053}- Well...|- Don't fumble for excuses.
{120055}{120121}Not here and now with my hair down.
{120147}{120236}At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to...
{120238}{120357}Well, to the fact that she's so young,|so feminine and so helpless.
{120359}{120436}To so many things I want to be for Bill.
{120465}{120618}It's funny, a woman's career. The things you|drop on your way up so you can move faster.
{120620}{120715}You forgetyou'll need them again|when you get backto being a woman.
{120717}{120834}That's one career all females have|in common, whether we like it or not.
{120836}{120886}Being a woman.
{120888}{120951}Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.
{120968}{121057}No matter how many|other careers we've had or wanted.
{121090}{121180}And in the last analysis,|nothing's any good unless you can
{121182}{121245}look up just before dinner or
{121247}{121310}turn around in bed and there he is.
{121312}{121367}Without that, you're not a woman.
{121369}{121500}You're something with a French provincial|office or a... a book full of clippings.
{121532}{121592}But you're not a woman.
{121681}{121736}Slow curtain. The end.
{121797}{121912}Margo. Margo, I wantyou|to know how sorry I am about this.
{121923}{121983}- About what?|- This.
{121985}{122049}I can't tell you how sorry I am.
{122051}{122123}Don't give it a thought.|One of destiny's merry pranks.
{122125}{122236}After all, you didn't personally|drain the gasoline tank yourself.
{122402}{122456}Eve, of course, was superb.
{122458}{122580}Many of the audience understandably|preferred to return another time to see Margo.
{122582}{122691}But those who remained cheered loudly,|lustily and longfor Eve.
{122693}{122781}How thoughtful of her to call|and invite me that afternoon.
{122783}{122864}And what a happy coincidence|that several representatives
{122866}{122926}of other newspapers happened to be present.
{122928}{122983}All of us invited that afternoon
{122985}{123097}to attend an understudy's performance,|about which the management knew nothing
{123099}{123185}until they were forced|to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.
{123187}{123221}Coincidence.
{123223}{123279}You were better than all right.
{123281}{123367}You rang a bell. Little things|here and there, but it doesn't matter.
{123369}{123430}Be proud of yourself. You've got a right to be.
{123432}{123482}Are you proud of me, Bill?
{123484}{123557}I admit I was worried|when Max called. I had my doubts.
{123563}{123666}- You shouldn't have had any doubts.|- After all, the other day was one scene.
{123668}{123730}The woods are full of one-scene sensations.
{123732}{123825}But you did it. With work and patience,|you'll be a good actress
{123827}{123906}- if that's whatyou wanna be.|- Is that whatyou want me to be?
{123908}{124006}- I'm talking aboutyou and whatyou want.|- So am I.
{124053}{124133}- What have I got to do with it?|- Everything.
{124194}{124307}The names I've been called,|but never Svengali. Good luck.
{124374}{124438}Don't run away, Bill.
{124440}{124500}From what would I be running?
{124543}{124637}You're always after truth|on the stage. What about off?
{124655}{124735}- I'm for it.|- Then face it. I have.
{124743}{124873}- Ever since that first night in here.|- I told you what every actress should know.
{124875}{124971}You told me that whatever I became,|it would be because of you.
{124973}{125045}- Make-up's a little heavy.|- And for you.
{125069}{125140}- You're quite a girl.|- You think?
{125142}{125262}- I'm in love with Margo. Hadn'tyou heard?|- You hear all kinds of things.
{125264}{125358}I'm only human, rumours to the contrary,|and I'm as curious as the next man.
{125360}{125430}- Find out.|- Only thing:
{125432}{125486}what I go after I want to go after.
{125488}{125538}I don't want it to come after me.
{125705}{125796}Don't cry. Just score it|as an incomplete forward pass.
{126326}{126376}Who is it?
{126417}{126467}May I come in?
{126492}{126542}Certainly, Mr DeWitt.
{126615}{126714}I expected to find this room|with a theatreful of people atyour feet.
{126716}{126824}- I'm lucky they didn't throwthings.|- Your performance was no surprise to me.
{126826}{126909}After the other day, I regarded it|as simply a promise fulfilled.
{126911}{127008}You're more than kind. But it's|still Miss Channing's performance.
{127010}{127089}I'm the carbon copy you read|when you can't find the original.
{127091}{127217}- You're more than modest.|- It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.
{127219}{127276}A revolutionary approach to the theatre.
{127278}{127385}- But if I may make a suggestion...|- Please do.
{127387}{127460}I thinkthe time has come|to shed some of your humility.
{127462}{127563}It is just as false not to blow your horn|at all as it is to blow it too loudly.
{127570}{127638}I don't think I've done anything|to sound off about.
{127640}{127738}We come into this world with our little|egos equipped with individual horns.
{127740}{127790}If we don't blowthem, who else will?
{127792}{127946}Even so... one pretty good performance by|an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.
{127978}{128047}It needn't be.
{128049}{128184}Even if I wanted to, as you say,|be less humble, blow my own horn,
{128213}{128285}how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
{128312}{128394}- I'm somebody.|- You certainly are.
{128429}{128515}Leave the door open a bit... so we can talk.
{128627}{128737}After you change, if you're not busy|elsewhere, we could have supper.
{128744}{128819}I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?
{128829}{128929}Let's have a minimum of pretending.|I shall want to do a column aboutyou.
{128931}{128987}I'm not even enough for a paragraph.
{128989}{129105}Perhaps more than one. There's so much|I want to know. I've heard your story in part.
{129107}{129223}Your home in Wisconsin, your tragic|marriage, your fanatical attachment to Margo.
{129225}{129298}It started in San Francisco, didn't it?
{129321}{129426}I say your idolatry of Margo|started in San Francisco, didn't it?
{129428}{129457}That's right.
{129459}{129553}San Francisco, an oasis of|civilisation in the California desert.
{129555}{129658}Tell me, do you share|my high opinion of San Francisco?
{129660}{129710}Yes, I do.
{129727}{129830}And that memorable night when Margo|first dazzled you from the stage,
{129832}{129932}what theatre was it in San Francisco?|Was it the Shubert?
{129934}{129984}Yes, the Shubert.
{129998}{130087}Fine old theatre, the Shubert. Full of tradition.
{130089}{130179}Untouched by the earthquake.|Or should I say fire?
{130182}{130248}Tell me, what was your husband's name?
{130272}{130322}- Eddie.|- Eddie what?
{130416}{130508}I'm about to go into the shower.|I won't be able to hear you.
{130510}{130555}Well, it can wait.
{130557}{130635}Where would you like to go?|We must make this a special night.
{130637}{130715}You take charge.
{130717}{130762}I believe I will.
{131103}{131196}Some morning papers carried|a squib about Eve's performance.
{131198}{131257}Not much, but full of praise.
{131259}{131321}I couldn't imagine|how they found out about it.
{131323}{131423}But Lloyd said Max's publicity man|probably sent out the story.
{131425}{131505}At any rate, lfelt terribly guilty|and ashamed of myself
{131507}{131588}and wanted nothing so much|as to forget the whole thing.
{131590}{131646}Margo and I were having lunch at 21,
{131648}{131711}just like girlfriends... with hats on.
{131761}{131817}- Has Miss Channing come in?|- Notyet.
{131819}{131869}Thank you.
{131893}{131998}Eve! I've heard the most wonderful|things aboutyour performance.
{132000}{132084}- Relief that I managed to stagger through it.|- She was magnificent.
{132086}{132140}- Then you've heard, too.|- I was there.
{132142}{132214}- You were at the play last night?|- A happy coincidence.
{132216}{132318}- We're having lunch with a talent scout.|- They certainly don't waste much time.
{132320}{132411}- It's nothing definite. Just lunch.|- They'll be wasting their time.
{132413}{132486}Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.
{132488}{132566}By your smart dress,|I take ityour companion is a lady?
{132568}{132623}- Margo.|- Margo lunching in public?
{132625}{132693}It's a new Margo,|but she's just as late as the old one.
{132695}{132755}She may be later than you think.
{132838}{132905}Why not read my column to pass the time?
{132907}{132975}- The minutes will fly like hours.|- Thank you, Addison.
{132977}{133040}Now we must join our sunburnt eager beaver.
{133042}{133092}- Goodbye, Karen.|- Goodbye.
{133641}{133707}"And so my hat which has,|lo, these many seasons,
{133709}{133800}become firmly rooted about my ears,|is lifted to Miss Harrington."
{133802}{133898}"I am available for dancing in the streets|and shouting from the housetops."
{133900}{133991}I thought that one went out with Woollcott.|Now listen to this.
{133993}{134097}"Miss Harrington had much to tell and|these columns shall report her faithfully
{134099}{134193}about the lamentable practice|in our theatre of permitting
{134195}{134265}mature actresses to continue playing roles
{134267}{134373}requiring a youth and vigour|of which they retain but a dim memory."
{134375}{134450}- I just can't believe it.|- It gets better.
{134452}{134561}"About the understandable reluctance|of our entrenched first ladies of the stage
{134563}{134631}to encourage, shall we say,|younger actresses,
{134633}{134718}and Miss Harrington's unsupported|struggle for opportunity."
{134720}{134795}- I can't believe Eve said those things.|- In this rat race,
{134797}{134862}everybody's guilty till proved innocent.
{134864}{134976}One of the differences between|the theatre and civilisation.
{134978}{135098}What gets me is how all the papers happened|to catch that particular performance.
{135100}{135150}Lloyd says it's a publicity release.
{135152}{135219}The witch must have sent out Indian Runners,
{135221}{135346}snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms|and museums or wherever they hole up.
{135348}{135439}She won't get away with it.|Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen.
{135441}{135528}If Equity or my lawyer can't|or won't do anything about it,
{135530}{135684}I shall personally stuff that pathetic little|lost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!
{135913}{136024}I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.|I ran all the way.
{136297}{136354}Bill's here, baby.
{136356}{136406}Everything's all right now.
{136601}{136688}I guess at this point|I'm what the French call "de trop".
{136690}{136755}Maybe just a little around the edges.
{137061}{137155}It's Addison from start to finish.|It drips with his brand of venom.
{137157}{137220}Taking advantage of a kid,|twisting her words,
{137222}{137289}making her say what he wanted her to say.
{137291}{137375}- Where did you get all that information?|- Eve.
{137377}{137449}- Eve?|- She's been to see me.
{137451}{137530}She left just before you came in.|You just missed her.
{137532}{137616}- That was a pity.|- Wanted to explain about the interview.
{137618}{137709}Wanted to apologise to someone,|and didn't dare face Margo.
{137711}{137805}- I wonder why.|- She started talking and couldn't finish.
{137807}{137857}She cried so.
{137894}{137993}I've been going over our financial position,|if you'll pardon the expression.
{137995}{138103}- That's quite a change of subject.|- What with taxes coming up, and,
{138105}{138198}since I'm a playwright and not|an oil-well operator, I was thinking...
{138200}{138255}I'm trying hard to follow you.
{138257}{138346}Instead of waiting until next season|to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,
{138348}{138393}which is in pretty good shape,
{138395}{138489}and if Margo can be talked into|going on tour with Aged in Wood,
{138491}{138566}we could put Footsteps|into production right away.
{138568}{138659}- I'm beginning to catch up.|- If we can cast it properly, that is.
{138661}{138777}Maybe get some younger actress? Someone|who'd lookthe part as well as play it?
{138779}{138890}- You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.|- Now you're quoting Addison... or Eve.
{138892}{138950}Eve did mention the play, but in passing.
{138952}{139024}She'd never have the nerve|to askto play a part like Cora.
{139026}{139101}Eve would askAbbott to give her Costello.
{139103}{139182}I got the idea myself while|she was talking about the play.
{139184}{139252}- With gestures, of course.|- To write something
{139254}{139369}and have it realised completely.|For once, not to compromise.
{139385}{139495}Lloyd Richards, do not consider giving|that contemptible little worm the part of Cora!
{139497}{139616}- Now just a minute...|- Margo's not been exactly a compromise.
{139618}{139707}Playwrights everywhere would|give their shirts for that compromise.
{139709}{139736}Now just a minute...
{139738}{139821}Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude|must be contagious.
{139823}{139910}All this hysteria because|of an impulsive excited kid
{139912}{139982}and a professional|manure-slinger named DeWitt.
{139984}{140077}- She apologised, didn't she?|- On her knees, I've no doubt.
{140079}{140154}Very touching.|Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.
{140156}{140253}That bitter cynicism is something|you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.
{140255}{140383}That cynicism I acquired the day I|discovered I was different from little boys.
{140416}{140457}Hello.
{140468}{140524}Hi, Margo.
{140526}{140581}No, not at all.
{140616}{140683}Karen and I were just chatting.
{140758}{140839}Yes, I'm sure we can|and I'm sure we'd love to.
{140852}{140916}Right. 11.45ish.
{140962}{141012}See you then.
{141041}{141168}Margo and Bill want us to meet them|at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.
{141170}{141233}Margo Channing in the Cub Room.
{141235}{141318}I couldn't be more surprised|if she'd said Grant's tomb.
{141320}{141420}- I'm glad Bill's back.|- They'd die without each other.
{141445}{141529}I didn't promise Eve anything.|I said she'd be fine for the part
{141531}{141586}but there were practical difficulties.
{141588}{141638}- Such as?|- You, for one.
{141640}{141740}I told her you wanted Margo to play|the part and I would wantyour approval.
{141742}{141794}That's fine. Fine and dandy.
{141796}{141896}Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's|future requests to me.
{141993}{142102}The so-called art of acting is not one|for which I have a particularly high regard.
{142104}{142173}- Hear, hear.|- Butyou may quote me as follows:
{142175}{142299}"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave|a performance in your cockamamie play,
{142301}{142448}the like of which I have never seen before|and expect rarely to see again."
{142450}{142536}- He does not exaggerate. I was good.|- You were great.
{142538}{142665}Quite a night. I hear your understudy,|a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.
{142667}{142718}- Too bad.|- I'm broken up about it.
{142720}{142789}You just can't pick up|champagne and drink it.
{142791}{142851}Somebody's got to be|very witty about a toast.
{142853}{142903}I shall propose the toast,
{142905}{142980}without wit, with all my heart.
{143004}{143046}To Margo.
{143048}{143123}- To my bride-to-be.|- Glory hallelujah.
{143128}{143178}- Margo.|- Drink.
{143250}{143347}- When? When are you going to do it?|- Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.
{143349}{143414}- And you're going to be on time.|- Yes, sir.
{143416}{143545}City Hall, that's for prizefighters and|reporters. I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...
{143547}{143640}It's only for the licence.|There's a three-day wait for blood tests.
{143642}{143719}I'll marry you if it turns out|you have no blood at all.
{143726}{143796}- What are you going to wear?|- Something simple,
{143798}{143847}a fur coat over a nightgown.
{143849}{143969}The point is this. In a cathedral,|a ballpark or a penny arcade,
{143971}{144065}we wantyou two beside us,|as our nearest and dearest friends.
{144067}{144147}Which we are. Which we'll always be.
{144149}{144263}There are very few moments in life|as good as this. Let's remember it.
{144265}{144358}To each of us and all of us -|never have we been more close.
{144360}{144420}May we never be farther apart.
{144478}{144524}- Mrs Richards?|- Yes.
{144526}{144576}- For you.|- Thank you.
{144605}{144678}Very indiscreet. A note in the open like that.
{144680}{144758}Next time, tell your lover|to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.
{144760}{144816}Lloyd, I wantyou to be big about this.
{144818}{144905}The world is full of love tonight.|No woman is safe.
{144907}{145042}Well, this beats all world's records|for running, jumping or standing gall.
{145082}{145160}"Forgive my butting in to what|seems such a happy occasion,
{145162}{145217}but it's important that I speak with you."
{145219}{145278}"Please", and that's underlined,
{145280}{145353}"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."
{145372}{145453}I understand she's now|the understudy in there.
{145455}{145520}Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.
{145574}{145642}Well, look. There's Rasputin.
{145818}{145906}- More champagne, Miss Channing?|- That's what I said, bub.
{145908}{146030}- Maybe she just wants to apologise.|- I have no interest in anything she may say.
{146032}{146115}But what could she say?|That's what fascinates me.
{146117}{146221}- Go on, find out.|- Karen, in all the years of our friendship,
{146223}{146309}I have never letyou go|to the ladies' room alone.
{146311}{146379}Now I must. I am busting to find out
{146381}{146489}what's going on in that feverish|little brain waiting in there.
{146528}{146603}Well... all right.
{146725}{146773}Karen!
{146775}{146825}How nice.
{147100}{147170}Very effective, but why take it out on me?
{147771}{147824}I was wondering whether you'd come at all.
{147826}{147897}Don't get up. And don't act|as if I were the Queen Mother.
{147899}{147949}I don't expectyou to be pleasant.
{147951}{148003}I don't intend to be.
{148005}{148101}Can't we sit down just for a minute?|I've got a lot to say and none of it's easy.
{148103}{148162}- There can't be very much.|- But there is.
{148164}{148258}- Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.|- Why should you?
{148280}{148330}Please sit down.
{148464}{148554}You know, I've always considered|myself a very clever girl.
{148556}{148634}Smart, good head on my shoulders,|that sort of thing.
{148636}{148720}Never the wrong word at the wrong time.
{148722}{148782}But then I'd never metAddison DeWitt.
{148838}{148890}I remember I had a tooth pulled once.
{148892}{148970}They gave me some anaesthetic.|I don't remember the name.
{148972}{149017}It affected me strangely.
{149019}{149108}I found myself saying things|I wasn't even thinking.
{149110}{149208}As if my mind was outside of my body|and couldn't control what I did or said.
{149210}{149292}- And you felt like that talking to Addison?|- In a way.
{149294}{149404}You find yourself trying to say what|you mean, but somehowthe words change.
{149406}{149456}They become his words.
{149458}{149561}And suddenly you're not saying|what you mean, but what he means.
{149563}{149669}Do you expect me to believe thatyou didn't|say any of that? That they were all Addison?
{149671}{149728}I don't expectyou to believe anything,
{149730}{149828}except that the responsibility|is mine... and the disgrace.
{149862}{149922}Let's not get overdramatic.
{149961}{150036}You really have a low opinion|of me, haven'tyou?
{150056}{150113}I'll give you some pleasant news.
{150115}{150219}I've been told off|in no uncertain terms, all over town.
{150221}{150281}Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.
{150283}{150353}To know how Ioyal her friends are,
{150355}{150456}how much more Ioyal than|she had a right to expect me to be.
{150458}{150528}- Eve, don't cry.|- I'm not crying.
{150572}{150671}Tell me, how did your luncheon|turn out with the man from Hollywood?
{150673}{150798}Some vague promises of a test. If a particular|part should come along, one of those things.
{150800}{150905}- But the raves aboutyour performance...|- An understudy's performance.
{150907}{151023}Well, I think you're painting|the picture a little blacker than it is, really.
{151025}{151127}Don't underestimate him.|You have a powerful friend in Addison.
{151135}{151196}He's not my friend. You were my friends.
{151198}{151268}- He can help you.|- I wish I'd never met him.
{151270}{151320}I'd like him to be dead.
{151322}{151372}I want my friends back.
{151394}{151508}Eve... I don't think|you meant to cause unhappiness.
{151510}{151613}But you did. More to yourself perhaps,|as it turned out, than to anyone else.
{151615}{151690}- I'll never get over it.|- Yes, you will.
{151692}{151803}You theatre people always do.|Nothing is for ever in the theatre.
{151805}{151908}Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up, burns hot,
{151910}{151960}and it's gone.
{151973}{152064}- I wish I could believe that.|- Give yourself time.
{152066}{152128}Don't worry too much|about what people think.
{152130}{152195}You're very young and very talented.
{152223}{152328}And, believe it or not,|if there's anything I can do...
{152330}{152389}There is something.
{152446}{152556}- I think I know.|- Something most importantyou can do.
{152565}{152667}You wanna play Cora. You want me|to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
{152673}{152746}If you told him so, he'd give me|the part. He said he would.
{152748}{152864}After all you've said. Don'tyou know|that part was written for Margo?
{152866}{152933}It might've been 15 years ago.|It's my part now.
{152935}{153065}- You talk just as Addison said you did.|- Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.
{153072}{153173}- Nothing in the world will make me say that.|- Addison wants me to play it.
{153175}{153250}- Over my dead body.|- That won't be necessary.
{153259}{153347}Addison knows how Margo|happened to miss that performance,
{153349}{153475}how I happened to know she'd miss it|in time to notify every paper in town.
{153477}{153559}It's quite a story.|Addison could make quite a thing of it.
{153561}{153664}Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,|and still tell nothing but the truth.
{153669}{153733}I had a time persuading him.
{153763}{153838}You better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.
{153945}{154057}If I play Cora, Addison will never|tell what happened, in or out of print.
{154059}{154133}A simple exchange of favours.
{154135}{154218}I'm so happy I can do something|for you at long last.
{154270}{154323}Your friendship with Margo,
{154325}{154387}your deep, close friendship.
{154397}{154530}What would happen to it if she knewthe|cheap trick you played on her for my benefit?
{154532}{154623}You and Lloyd, how long, even in the theatre,
{154651}{154751}before people forgot what happened|and trusted you again?
{154799}{154840}No.
{154869}{154973}It would be so much easier for everyone|concerned if I were to play Cora.
{154975}{155035}So much better theatre, too.
{155055}{155105}A part in a play.
{155134}{155214}You'd do all that just for a part in a play?
{155216}{155286}I'd do much more for a part that good.
{155845}{155895}Hungry?
{155938}{156027}I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.
{156029}{156120}Nothing of the kind.|Karen and I had a nice talk.
{156122}{156172}Heart to heart? Woman to woman?
{156174}{156287}Including a casual reference to the part|of Cora and your hopes of playing it?
{156289}{156404}I discussed it very openly. I told her I'd|spoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested.
{156406}{156509}And Karen mentioned, of course,|that Margo expects to play the part?
{156511}{156603}Oddly enough, she didn't|say a word about Margo.
{156605}{156714}Just that she'll be happy to do|what she can to see that I play it.
{156745}{156805}Just like that?
{156807}{156868}Just like that.
{156870}{156963}You know, Eve, sometimes|I think you keep things from me.
{156995}{157074}- I don't thinkthat's funny.|- It wasn't meant to be.
{157076}{157167}I confide in you and rely on you|more than anyone I've ever known.
{157169}{157238}To say a thing like that now,|without any reason,
{157240}{157297}when I need you more than ever.
{157299}{157360}I hope you mean whatyou say.
{157362}{157422}I intend to hold you to it.
{157454}{157528}We have a great deal|in common, it seems to me.
{157762}{157853}- Well, what happened?|- Nothing much. She apologised.
{157855}{157902}- With tears?|- With tears.
{157904}{157998}But not right away. First fight them back,|chin up, stout fellow.
{158000}{158060}- Check.|- Very classy. Lots of technique.
{158062}{158178}You mean all this time she's done|nothing but apologise? What did you say?
{158195}{158245}Not much.
{158305}{158375}Groom, may I have a wedding present?
{158377}{158482}- What would you like? Texas?|- I want everybody to shut up about Eve.
{158484}{158553}Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.
{158555}{158606}Give Karen more wine.
{158608}{158659}Never have I been so happy.
{158661}{158737}Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.
{158739}{158843}What a lovely, clever name.|Where the elite meet.
{158845}{158949}Never have I seen so much elite,|all with their eyes on me,
{158951}{159058}waiting for me to crackthat little|gnome on the noggin with a bottle.
{159060}{159166}But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.|Even Eve. I forgive Eve.
{159190}{159246}There they go.
{159274}{159315}There goes Eve.
{159317}{159391}Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.
{159422}{159493}But "the evil that men do..."|How does that go, groom?
{159495}{159612}Something about the good they leave behind.|I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.
{159614}{159680}You've got it backwards,|even for Wilkes-Barre.
{159682}{159770}Do you know why I forgive Eve?|She left good behind.
{159777}{159882}The four of us here together -|it's Eve fault. I forgive her.
{159897}{160001}And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.
{160010}{160067}You know, she probably means well after all.
{160069}{160151}- She is a louse.|- Never try to outguess Margo.
{160167}{160221}- Groom?|- Yes, dear.
{160223}{160278}- Do you know what I'm going to be?|- A cowboy?
{160280}{160354}- A married lady.|- With a paper to prove it.
{160356}{160448}I'm going to look up at six o'clock,|and there he'll be.
{160465}{160531}- Remember, Karen?|- I remember.
{160553}{160648}- You'll be there, won'tyou?|- Often enough to keep the franchise.
{160650}{160714}No more make-believe, offstage or on.
{160721}{160782}Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.
{160784}{160860}Lloyd, will you promise|not to be angry with me?
{160876}{160943}- That depends.|- No, I mean deeply angry.
{160949}{161003}I don't think I could be.
{161005}{161077}Well, I don't want to play Cora.
{161085}{161163}- What?|- You're always so touchy about his plays.
{161165}{161270}It isn't the part. It's a great part|and a fine play. But not for me any more.
{161272}{161376}Not for a foursquare, upright,|downright, forthright, married lady.
{161382}{161521}- What's your being married got to do with it?|- It means I've finally got a life to live.
{161523}{161593}I don't have to play parts I'm too old for
{161595}{161677}just because I've got|nothing to do with my nights.
{161698}{161761}Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.
{161763}{161881}I'll tour a year with this one, anything.|Only you do understand, don'tyou?
{162047}{162106}- What's so funny?|- Nothing.
{162116}{162201}- Nothing?|- Everything. Everything's so funny.
{162489}{162552}Lloyd never got around to asking
{162554}{162652}whether it was all right with me|for Eve to play Cora.
{162654}{162776}Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct|the play at first... with Eve in it.
{162778}{162845}Lloyd and Max finally won him over.
{162847}{162993}Margo never came to rehearsal.|Too much to do around the house, she said.
{162995}{163090}I'd never known Bill and Lloyd|to fight as bitterly and often,
{163092}{163156}and always over some business for Eve,
{163158}{163240}or a move, or the way she read a speech.
{163246}{163336}But I'd never known Lloyd|to meddle as much with Bill's directing,
{163338}{163417}as far as it affected Eve, that is.
{163419}{163482}Somehow Eve kept them going.
{163484}{163569}Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.
{163662}{163766}And I thought it might be best|if I skipped rehearsals from then on.
{163807}{163910}It seemed to me I had known always|that it would happen. And here it was.
{163912}{164030}I felt helpless. That helplessness you|feel when you have no talent to offer,
{164032}{164086}outside of loving your husband.
{164088}{164184}How could I compete?|Everything Lloyd loved about me,
{164186}{164236}he'd gotten used to long ago.
{164370}{164407}Hello?
{164409}{164464}Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?
{164466}{164565}My name wouldn't mean anything.|I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.
{164567}{164652}She isn't well. She's been crying|all night and she's hysterical.
{164654}{164706}She doesn't want a doctor and...
{164717}{164767}Who is it? What's it all about?
{164769}{164877}- Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?|- No. Eve didn't say to call him.
{164879}{165009}I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times.|I thought, they being such good friends...
{165011}{165087}This is Lloyd Richards.|Where is Eve? Let me talkto her.
{165089}{165168}Hello, Mr Richards.|She's upstairs in her room.
{165170}{165261}I really hate to bother you this way,|but the way Eve's been feeling,
{165263}{165354}I've been worried sick, what with|her leaving tomorrowfor New Haven.
{165356}{165430}Tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be right over.
{165875}{165956}To the theatre world,|New Haven, Connecticut,
{165958}{166074}is a short stretch of sidewalk between|the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,
{166076}{166161}surrounded by what looks|very much like a small city.
{166163}{166283}It is here that managers have|what are called out-of-town openings,
{166285}{166387}which are openings for New Yorkers|who want to go out of town.
{166405}{166485}What a day. What a heavenly day.
{166487}{166561}- D-day.|- Just like it.
{166563}{166667}Tomorrow morning, you will have won|your beachhead on the shores of immortality.
{166669}{166719}Stop rehearsing your column.
{166742}{166790}Isn't it strange, Addison?
{166792}{166896}I thought I'd be panic-stricken,|want to run away or something.
{166898}{166999}Instead, I can't wait for tonight|to come. To come and go.
{167001}{167054}Are you that sure of tomorrow?
{167056}{167120}- Aren'tyou?|- Frankly, yes.
{167278}{167328}It'll be a night to remember.
{167330}{167396}It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.
{167398}{167462}The end of an old road,|the beginning of a new one.
{167464}{167566}- All paved with diamonds and gold?|- You know me better than that.
{167568}{167618}Paved with what, then?
{167640}{167690}Stars.
{167716}{167764}What time?
{167766}{167816}Almost four.
{167830}{167886}Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.
{167888}{167949}We rehearsed most of last night.
{167951}{168004}You could sleep now, couldn'tyou?
{168006}{168080}- Why not?|- The mark of a true killer.
{168103}{168180}Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting.
{168182}{168248}Why did you call me a killer?
{168250}{168352}Did I say killer? I meant champion.|I get my boxing terms mixed.
{168383}{168464}Addison, come in for a minute, will you?
{168466}{168526}I've got something to tell you.
{168763}{168842}Suites are for expense accounts.|You're being extravagant.
{168844}{168961}Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd|had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.
{168983}{169098}- Can I fix you a drink?|- With the reluctant compliments of Max?
{169100}{169160}Lloyd. I never have any.
{169162}{169241}He likes a few drinks after we finish,|so he sent it up.
{169243}{169341}Some plain soda. Lloyd must be|expecting a record run in New Haven.
{169343}{169427}That's for tonight. You're invited.
{169429}{169506}We're having everyone up|after the performance.
{169508}{169557}"We are"?
{169559}{169609}Lloyd and I.
{169638}{169708}I find it odd that Karen|isn't here for the opening.
{169710}{169772}- Addison...|- She was always so devoted to Lloyd.
{169774}{169865}- One would think only death could keep her...|- Addison...
{169867}{170024}I said this would be a night to remember,|that it would bring me all I ever wanted.
{170026}{170137}Something about an old road ending|and a new one starting, all paved with stars.
{170139}{170200}I didn't mean just the theatre.
{170202}{170252}What else?
{170318}{170379}Lloyd Richards.
{170388}{170475}He's going to leave Karen.|We're going to be married.
{170507}{170578}So that's it. Lloyd.
{170580}{170647}Still just the theatre, after all.
{170649}{170696}It's nothing of the kind.
{170698}{170751}Lloyd loves me. I love him.
{170757}{170861}I know nothing of Lloyd's loves. I leave|those to Louisa May Alcott. But I know you.
{170863}{170981}- I'm in love with Lloyd.|- He is a commercially successful playwright.
{170988}{171075}- You have no right to say that.|- And, artistically, very promising.
{171077}{171131}Eve, dear, this is Addison.
{171186}{171240}Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?
{171242}{171326}Lloyd and I.|There's no telling howfar we can go.
{171328}{171414}He'll write great plays for me.|I'll make them great.
{171416}{171487}You're the only one who knows,|except Lloyd and me.
{171489}{171539}- And Karen.|- She doesn't know.
{171541}{171613}- She knows enough not to be here.|- But not all of it.
{171615}{171690}- Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.|- I see.
{171701}{171780}And when was this unholy alliance joined?
{171782}{171867}We decided night before last,|before we came up here.
{171869}{171946}I trust the setting was properly romantic.
{171948}{172037}Lights on dimmers|and gypsy violins offstage.
{172039}{172097}The setting wasn't romantic,
{172099}{172148}but Lloyd was.
{172150}{172230}He woke me up at three o'clock|in the morning, banging on my door.
{172232}{172317}He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.
{172319}{172428}Couldn't go on with the play or anything|else until I promised to marry him.
{172430}{172500}We sat and talked until it was light.
{172502}{172558}He never went home.
{172560}{172666}- You sat and talked until it was light?|- We sat and talked, Addison.
{172692}{172753}I want a run-of-the-play contract.
{172790}{172890}There never was, and there|never will be, another like you.
{172920}{172976}Well, say something. Anything.
{172978}{173042}Congratulations. SkäI. Good work, Eve.
{173207}{173320}- What do you take me for?|- I don't knowthat I "take you" for anything.
{173322}{173394}Is it possible thatyou've confused me
{173396}{173476}with those backward children|you've played tricks on?
{173478}{173546}That you have the same contempt|for me as for them?
{173548}{173613}I'm sure you mean something,|but I don't know what.
{173615}{173677}Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.
{173689}{173799}I am Addison DeWitt.|I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.
{173806}{173906}- I never intended you to be.|- Yes, you did, and you still do.
{173908}{173996}I don't know whatyou mean.|But I want to take my nap. It's important...
{173998}{174091}- It's important that we talk, killer to killer.|- Champion to champion.
{174093}{174164}Not with me, you're no champion.|You're stepping up.
{174166}{174270}Please say whatyou have to say, plainly|and distinctly, and then let me take my nap.
{174272}{174412}Very well. Although it's unnecessary,|because you know what I'm going to say.
{174414}{174507}Lloyd may leave Karen,|but he will not leave Karen for you.
{174509}{174612}- What do you mean by that?|- More plainly and more distinctly?
{174614}{174701}I have not come to New Haven|to see the play, discuss your dreams,
{174703}{174771}or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.
{174773}{174863}I came to tell you thatyou will|not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,
{174865}{174915}because I will not permit it.
{174917}{174979}- What have you got to do with it?|- Everything.
{174987}{175068}Because after tonightyou will belong to me.
{175070}{175152}Belong? To you?
{175175}{175225}I can't believe my ears.
{175227}{175274}A dull cliché.
{175276}{175328}"Belong" to you?
{175330}{175408}That sounds medieval.|Something out of an old melodrama.
{175410}{175486}So does the history of the world|for the past 20 years.
{175488}{175539}I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.
{175541}{175625}I'd hoped thatyou would have|taken it for granted thatyou and I...
{175627}{175677}"Taken it for granted"?
{175679}{175729}"That you and I..."?
{175850}{175927}Now remember, as long as you live,|never to laugh at me.
{175929}{176001}At anything or anyone else, but never at me.
{176084}{176179}- Get out.|- You're too short for that gesture.
{176181}{176241}Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske.
{176269}{176344}Then if you won't get out,|I'll have you thrown out.
{176346}{176418}Don't pick up that phone. Don't even touch it.
{176420}{176480}Something told you to do|what I said, didn't it?
{176482}{176574}That instinct is worth millions.|You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.
{176576}{176659}When that alarm goes off,|go to your battle stations.
{176688}{176800}To begin with, your name is not Eve|Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.
{176802}{176894}- What of it?|- True, your parents were poor, and still are.
{176896}{177010}They would like to know how you are. They|haven't heard from you for three years.
{177012}{177062}What of it?
{177078}{177129}A matter of opinion, granted.
{177131}{177280}It's also true you worked in a brewery. But|life there was not as dull as you pictured it.
{177282}{177398}It got less and less dull, until your boss's|wife had your boss followed by detectives.
{177400}{177494}- She never proved a thing!|- But the $500 you got to get out of town
{177496}{177574}brought you straight to New York, didn't it?
{177773}{177884}- That $500 broughtyou straight to New York.|- She was a liar. She was a liar!
{177886}{177974}Answer my question.|Weren't you paid to get out of town?
{178053}{178140}There was no Eddie, no pilot.|You've never been married.
{178142}{178261}That was not only a lie, it was an insult to|dead heroes and the women who loved them.
{178263}{178365}San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.|You've never been to San Francisco.
{178367}{178455}That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,|not worthy of you.
{178457}{178580}I had to get in to meet Margo. I had to say|something, be somebody. Make her like me!
{178582}{178638}She did like you. She helped and trusted you.
{178640}{178711}- You repaid her by trying to win Bill.|- That's not true!
{178713}{178813}I was there. I saw you and heard you|through the dressing-room door.
{178832}{178920}You used my name to blackmail Karen|into getting you the part of Cora.
{178922}{178996}- You lied to me about it.|- No!
{179001}{179067}I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.
{179069}{179188}As always with women who try to find out|things, she told more than she learnt.
{179207}{179310}Now do you want to change your story about|Lloyd beating atyour door that night?
{179312}{179357}Please, please.
{179466}{179591}That I should wantyou at all suddenly|strikes me as the height of improbability.
{179593}{179680}But that in itself is probably the reason.
{179682}{179799}You're an improbable person, Eve,|and so am I. We have that in common.
{179801}{179904}Also a contempt for humanity,|an inability to love and be loved.
{179906}{179997}Insatiable ambition... and talent.
{179999}{180082}We deserve each other.|Are you listening to me?
{180137}{180207}- Then say so.|- Yes, Addison.
{180214}{180311}And you realise and you agree|how completely you belong to me?
{180322}{180361}Yes, Addison.
{180376}{180457}Then take your nap,|and good luck for tonight.
{180581}{180630}I won't play tonight.
{180632}{180743}I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.
{180745}{180846}"Couldn't go on"?|You'll give the performance of your life.
{181294}{181367}And she gave the performance of her life.
{181369}{181434}And it was a night to remember, that night.
{181677}{181752}Honoured members of|the Sarah Siddons Society,
{181754}{181837}distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.
{181868}{181927}What is there for me to say?
{181929}{182012}Everything wise and witty|has long since been said
{182014}{182121}by minds more mature|and talents far greater than mine.
{182123}{182207}For me to thank you as equals|would be presumptuous.
{182209}{182269}I am an apprentice in the theatre,
{182271}{182346}and have much to learn from all of you.
{182348}{182436}Let me say only that I am proud and happy,
{182459}{182532}and that I regard this great honour
{182534}{182611}not so much as an award|for what I have achieved,
{182613}{182715}but as a standard to hold against|what I have yet to accomplish.
{182749}{182869}And, further, that I regard it|as bestowed upon me only in part.
{182896}{183005}The larger share belongs|to my friends in the theatre,
{183007}{183069}and to the theatre itself
{183071}{183141}which has given me all I have.
{183175}{183275}In good conscience,|I must give credit where credit is due.
{183311}{183398}To Max Fabian. Dear Max.
{183410}{183510}Dear sentimental, generous,|courageous Max Fabian,
{183512}{183605}who took a chance on|an unknown, untried amateur.
{183717}{183803}To my first friend in the theatre,
{183805}{183899}whose kindness and graciousness|I shall never forget,
{183901}{183961}Karen. Mrs Lloyd Richards.
{184109}{184204}It was Karen who first brought me|to one whom I'd always idolised,
{184206}{184286}one who became|my benefactress and champion.
{184315}{184407}A great actress and a great woman,
{184417}{184468}Margo Channing.
{184584}{184642}To my director,
{184644}{184763}who demanded always a little more|than my talent could provide,
{184765}{184830}but who taught me patiently and well,
{184869}{184919}Bill Sampson.
{184986}{185084}And one without whose|great play and faith in me,
{185101}{185168}this night could never have been.
{185170}{185229}How can I repay Lloyd Richards?
{185297}{185353}How can I repay the many others,
{185355}{185429}so many, I couldn't possibly name them all,
{185431}{185505}whose help, guidance, and advice
{185542}{185665}have made this, the happiest|night of my life, possible.
{185770}{185867}Although I am going to Hollywood|next weekto make a film,
{185869}{185948}do not think for a moment|that I am leaving you.
{185950}{186003}How could I?
{186005}{186073}My heart is here in the theatre,
{186075}{186183}and 3,000 miles are too far|to be away from one's heart.
{186185}{186257}I'll be backto claim it... and soon.
{186298}{186392}That is, if you want me back.
{186549}{186626}Good night to you all,|and to all, a good night.
{186809}{186916}For services rendered beyond...|whatever it is of duty, darling.
{187031}{187158}Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home|before my guests start stealing the liquor.
{187224}{187293}- Congratulations, Eve.|- Thank you, Karen.
{187377}{187472}- Congratulations, Miss Harrington.|- Thank you so much.
{187488}{187603}Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry|too much aboutyour heart.
{187605}{187695}You can always put that award|where your heart ought to be.
{187755}{187805}I don't suppose there's a drink left?
{187807}{187874}- You can have one at Max's.|- I don't think I'm going.
{187876}{187973}- Why not?|- Because I don't want to.
{187975}{188061}- I'm so happy for you, Eve.|- Thank you so much.
{188096}{188218}Max has gone to a lot of trouble. This is going|to be an elaborate party and it's for you.
{188220}{188305}No, it isn't. It's for this.
{188307}{188372}- It's the same thing, isn't it?|- Exactly.
{188403}{188472}Here, take it to the party instead of me.
{188474}{188528}You're being very childish.
{188530}{188631}- I'm tired. I want to go home.|- Very well. I'll drop you off.
{188633}{188720}I shall go to the party alone.|I have no intention of missing it.
{190795}{190846}- Who are you?|- Miss Harrington.
{190848}{190939}- What are you doing here?|- I... I guess I fell asleep.
{191014}{191112}Please don't have me arrested.|I didn't steal anything. You can search me.
{191114}{191209}- How did you get in here?|- I hid outside till the maid came in.
{191211}{191279}She went out to get something|and left the door open.
{191281}{191379}I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.|Then I just looked around.
{191381}{191471}I was afraid someone would notice|the lights were on, so I turned them off.
{191473}{191559}- Then I guess I fell asleep.|- You were just looking around?
{191561}{191607}- That's all.|- What for?
{191609}{191673}- You probably won't believe me.|- Probably not.
{191675}{191734}- It was for my report.|- What report? To whom?
{191736}{191805}About how you live,|what kind of clothes you wear,
{191807}{191906}what kind of perfume|and books, things like that.
{191908}{192005}You knowthe Eve Harrington Club that|they have in most girls' high schools?
{192007}{192103}- I've heard of them.|- Ours was one of the first - Erasmus Hall.
{192105}{192208}- I'm the president.|- Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
{192210}{192316}Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.|Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.
{192318}{192376}Of course, they're just movie stars.
{192378}{192442}You're going to Hollywood, aren'tyou?
{192477}{192564}From the trunks you're packing,|you must be going to stay a long time.
{192566}{192616}I might.
{192712}{192782}That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.
{192784}{192844}Maid'll fix it in the morning.
{192866}{192936}- I'll just clean up the mess.|- Don't bother.
{192957}{193030}- How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?|- Subway.
{193057}{193111}How long does it take?
{193113}{193183}With changing and everything,|a little over an hour.
{193185}{193273}It's after one now.|You won't get home till all hours.
{193317}{193367}I don't care if I never get home.
{193423}{193473}That's the door.
{193547}{193597}You rest. I'll get it.
{193793}{193848}Hello. Who are you?
{193868}{193965}Miss Harrington's resting, Mr DeWitt.|She asked me to see who it is.
{193967}{194017}Well, we won't disturb her rest.
{194019}{194142}It seems Miss Harrington left her award|in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?
{194173}{194244}Tell me, how did you know my name?
{194263}{194328}It's a very famous name, Mr DeWitt.
{194330}{194388}- And what's your name?|- Phoebe.
{194404}{194476}- Phoebe?|- I call myself Phoebe.
{194509}{194554}And why not?
{194556}{194684}Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday|to have an award like that of your own?
{194686}{194816}- More than anything else in the world.|- Then ask Miss Harrington howto get one.
{194844}{194914}Miss Harrington knows all about it.
{195119}{195171}Who was it?
{195173}{195225}Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.
{195227}{195320}You leftyour award in his cab,|and he brought it back.
{195322}{195419}Put it on one of the trunks,|will you? I wanna pack it.
{195421}{195471}Sure, Miss Harrington.
{4454}{4502}Mrs. Alsop's out!
{7070}{7133}- Did you turn off the gas?|- What gas?
{7141}{7207}- Which is her room?|- Er, this one.
{7471}{7534}We must move her.|Where's the landlady?
{7539}{7571}- Not home.|- Where's your room?
{7576}{7601}Two floors up.
{7606}{7665}Take her shoulders,|I'll take her feet.
{7684}{7722}Come on, Miss.
{7937}{7975}Pick up my bag.
{7980}{8045}Sorry,|you'll have to do that yourself.
{8305}{8373}Open the windows.|She needs lots of fresh air.
{8380}{8413}So do I.
{8584}{8625}- Shall I call an ambulance?|- No time.
{8630}{8698}She needs an emetic first.|Glass of water, please.
{8717}{8750}Here it is.
{8821}{8889}I need 2 quarts of warm water|and some towels.
{8894}{8937}Towels, coming up.
{9193}{9244}You found this bottle|clutched in her hand?
{9249}{9308}Certainly did, from your dispensary.
{9322}{9393}I see.|How long have you known this girl?
{9403}{9445}About five minutes.
{9450}{9524}She'll need looking after|for a couple of days.
{9535}{9608}- How about the ambulance?|- It isn't necessary now.
{9623}{9662}She's out of danger.
{9673}{9761}Besides, sending her to a hospital|would start an inquiry.
{9774}{9831}And attempted suicide means jail.
{9839}{9910}However, in a couple of days|she'll be fully recovered.
{9915}{9965}Meanwhile, let her rest quietly.
{9970}{10028}If she's thirsty|give her orange juice.
{10033}{10079}And tomorrow,|if she has an appetite
{10084}{10140}a little chicken broth,|but no tinned food.
{10146}{10220}Now, if you'll be at my dispensary|in ten minutes
{10225}{10257}I'll have a prescription for you.
{10262}{10335}- For me?|- No. For her, of course.
{11030}{11064}Headache?
{11083}{11118}Where am I?
{11134}{11191}In my room.|I live two floors above you.
{11214}{11241}What happened?
{11255}{11336}I came home this evening and|smelled gas coming from your room
{11341}{11376}so I broke in the door,|called a doctor,
{11381}{11430}and together we brought you here.
{11456}{11495}Why didn't you let me die?
{11504}{11533}What's your hurry?
{11555}{11599}Are you in pain?
{11671}{11768}That's all that matters.|The rest is fantasy.
{11793}{11872}Billions of years it's taken|to evolve human consciousness
{11877}{11919}and you want to wipe it out.
{11924}{12000}Wipe out the miracle|of all existence.
{12005}{12094}More important than anything|in the whole universe!
{12102}{12149}What can the stars do?
{12159}{12234}Nothing...|but sit on their axis!
{12310}{12343}And the sun,
{12351}{12433}shooting flames 280,000 miles high...
{12438}{12480}So what?
{12502}{12574}Wasting all its natural resources.
{12591}{12668}Can the sun think? Is it conscious?
{12673}{12718}No, but you are!
{12802}{12846}Pardon me, my mistake.
{13151}{13215}Here you are, and there you go!
{13268}{13324}Well, bless me. Heavens alive!
{13329}{13394}Look at that. Look at me door!
{13404}{13456}House breaking, that's what it is!
{13461}{13527}I suppose she's taken her things.|She'll go to jail for this.
{13546}{13587}I knew she was no good.
{13592}{13655}That quiet type.
{13661}{13723}Still waters that run deep|usually stink!
{13930}{14003}That's funny,|she hasn't taken a thing.
{14008}{14049}And she won't, either.
{14054}{14112}Not until she's paid 4 weeks rent.
{14117}{14151}Smashing in a door!
{14156}{14228}Nice festivities|going on behind my back!
{14233}{14300}Well, she's out now|and she'll stay out!
{14604}{14691}Mr. Calvero! Oh Mr. Calvero!
{15580}{15639}Is that you, Mr. Calvero?
{15653}{15729}Your laundry.|I was about to leave it on your bed.
{15736}{15773}Just a moment!
{15922}{15960}Hold it, hold it!
{15973}{16006}Hold everything!
{16312}{16357}You dropped these.
{16415}{16465}And here's your oranges.
{16489}{16516}Thank you.
{17066}{17126}So this is|how she spends her evenings.
{17137}{17197}You take your hands off me!
{17202}{17240}What's she doing in your room?
{17245}{17278}The opposite of what you think.
{17283}{17350}I'd like to know|who smashed in the door downstairs.
{17355}{17392}- I did.|- You did!
{17397}{17427}You have a leaking gas pipe.
{17432}{17455}I have a what?
{17473}{17517}I mean that room|has a leaking gas pipe.
{17522}{17574}There's something fishy about this.
{17579}{17639}- Who is she anyway?|- You ought to know by now.
{17650}{17710}Came six weeks ago.|Said she was a working girl.
{17715}{17779}That's what they all say.|Why are you so interested?
{17784}{17835}The girl tried to kill herself.
{17840}{17924}Took poison, turned on the gas.|I came home just in time.
{17929}{17991}I'll call the police|and get an ambulance.
{17996}{18058}It'll be in all the papers.|You don't want that.
{18063}{18104}She's not staying where she is.
{18109}{18202}My good woman, I don't want her!|Let her go back to her room.
{18207}{18260}I should say not.|Besides, it's rented.
{18265}{18315}You can't throw her into the street!
{18320}{18381}She's not going back|to her own room.
{18386}{18420}Then she'll have to stay|where she is.
{18425}{18483}What? And scandalize my household!
{18488}{18556}We could be man and wife|for all anyone knows.
{18561}{18630}Oh, could you?|Well, you'd better not be.
{18635}{18687}You'd better get rid of her,|and quick.
{18692}{18731}Man and wife!
{18736}{18779}You watch out for that hussy.
{18784}{18876}She's no good. And she's been sick|since she came here.
{18965}{19015}It wouldn't be dandruff, would it?
{22016}{22045}Ready?
{23525}{23562}{y:i}I am an animal trainer
{23567}{23614}{y:i}A circus entertainer
{23619}{23703}{y:i}I train animals by the score|{y:i}Lions, tigers and wild boar
{23708}{23793}{y:i}I've made and lost a fortune|{y:i}In my wild career
{23798}{23892}{y:i}Some say the cause was women|{y:i}Some say it was beer
{23943}{24027}{y:i}Then I went through bankruptcy|{y:i}And lost my whole menagerie
{24032}{24114}{y:i}But I did not despair|{y:i}I got a bright idea
{24119}{24161}{y:i}While searching|{y:i}through my underwear
{24166}{24206}{y:i}A thought occurred to me
{24211}{24314}{y:i}I'm tired of training elephants|{y:i}So why not train a flea
{24346}{24438}{y:i}Why should I hunt for animals|{y:i}And through the jungle roam
{24443}{24540}{y:i}When there's local talent|{y:i}to be found right here at home
{24582}{24643}{y:i}I found one but I won't say where
{24653}{24718}{y:i}And educated him with care
{24723}{24785}{y:i}And taught him|{y:i}all the facts of life
{24790}{24855}{y:i}And then he found himself a wife
{24860}{24926}{y:i}I give them board and lodging free
{24931}{24992}{y:i}And every night they dine off me
{24997}{25059}{y:i}They don't eat caviar or cake
{25064}{25125}{y:i}But they enjoy a good rump steak
{25130}{25218}{y:i}Off my anatomy|{y:i}Off my anatomy
{25227}{25270}{y:i}It is an odd sensation
{25275}{25380}{y:i}When after meals they take a stroll|{y:i}Around the old plantation
{25413}{25471}{y:i}Now I'm as happy as can be
{25476}{25542}{y:i}I've taught them lots of tricks|{y:i}you see
{25547}{25644}{y:i}And now they're both supporting me|{y:i}They're both supporting me
{25692}{25771}{y:i}So walk up, walk up|{y:i}I've the greatest show on earth
{25778}{25868}{y:i}Walk up, walk up|{y:i}And get your money's worth
{25873}{25957}{y:i}See Phyllis and Henry|{y:i}Those educated fleas
{25962}{26046}{y:i}Cavorting and sporting|{y:i}On the flying trapeze
{26051}{26132}{y:i}So any time you itch|{y:i}Don't scratch or make a fuss
{26137}{26228}{y:i}You never can tell you might destroy|{y:i}Some budding genius
{26668}{26717}Phyllis! Henry! Stop that!
{26722}{26758}What do you think you're doing?
{26777}{26860}You ought to be ashamed|of yourselves, fighting like that!
{26890}{26952}Alright. Phyllis, stay in the box!|Henry!
{27889}{27965}You should have done that|before I opened the box.
{27971}{28011}Do you hear? Come on!
{28464}{28509}Do you want me to squeeze?
{29352}{29386}Stop that now!
{29407}{29445}Come up from there!
{29451}{29521}Phyllis, you hear?|Remember you're on a diet.
{29548}{29617}Phyllis, have you gone mad?
{29703}{29754}Stop that, do you hear? Stop it!
{29834}{29916}Phyllis, do you hear?|Come up at once! You go too far!
{29930}{29994}Phyllis, what are you doing?
{30035}{30080}Crazy little creature!
{30086}{30147}Phyllis, Henry wants you.
{30161}{30197}Come, Phyllis.
{30212}{30242}Phyllis, stop that.
{30373}{30427}Phyllis, come out here!|Come out!
{30439}{30497}Where do you think you're going?|You nitwit!
{30534}{30569}Phyllis! Stop that now!
{30608}{30652}Do you want me to scratch?
{30795}{30839}That's not Phyllis.
{30860}{30897}Where's Phyllis?
{30902}{30943}Oh, there she is!
{32739}{32776}Are you awake?
{32846}{32898}Your husband said to look in on you.
{32925}{32985}- Who?|- Your husband.
{32995}{33055}He said to warm up|some chicken soup for you.
{33073}{33105}Husband?
{33138}{33179}Let me help you. Come on.
{33188}{33244}You haven't eaten a thing all day.
{33250}{33295}A nice warm soup will do you good.
{33300}{33328}Thank you, no.
{33594}{33621}Your wife won't eat.
{33626}{33693}Well, that's a blessing|to a poor married man.
{34024}{34054}How do you feel?
{34093}{34123}Much better, thank you.
{34128}{34160}Good.
{34166}{34213}Pay no attention|to this wife business.
{34218}{34301}It's a front of respectability|for the new housemaid.
{34346}{34435}However, as soon as you get well|you'll be free and divorced.
{34441}{34477}I think I'm well enough now.
{34482}{34581}Not quite. I think|you'd better stay another day or so.
{34586}{34627}You're very kind.
{34641}{34698}I think I'm able to get back|to my room now.
{34734}{34793}I'm afraid that isn't possible.
{34814}{34844}Why?
{34850}{34923}Mrs. Alsop's rented it.|The people are moving in today.
{34964}{34994}Oh, I see.
{35017}{35127}However you're welcome to stay here|until you know what you want to do.
{35144}{35192}What can I do? I'm helpless.
{35311}{35378}Why didn't you let me die|and get it over with!
{35383}{35465}That's no way to talk. You're alive|and you better make the most of it.
{35470}{35521}I'm destitute. Ill.
{35526}{35559}Listen...
{35580}{35635}I don't know what's wrong with you,
{35651}{35732}but if you're ill,|and if it's what Mrs. Alsop thinks,
{35737}{35807}you should do something about it.|It isn't hopeless.
{35816}{35850}If it's, uh...
{35898}{35931}You know what I'm talking about.
{35947}{35979}I don't think I do.
{36002}{36045}Well, let me put it this way.
{36050}{36144}A young girl, alone,|thrown into the world, gets ill.
{36167}{36222}If it's anything like that,|you can be cured.
{36230}{36324}There's a new drug performing|miracles, curing thousands.
{36351}{36404}If it's anything of that nature|don't be afraid to tell,
{36409}{36444}maybe I can help.
{36455}{36510}I'm an old sinner,|nothing shocks me.
{36595}{36631}It's nothing like that.
{36640}{36676}Are you sure?
{36696}{36719}Positive.
{36724}{36758}But you have been ill?
{36763}{36863}Yes. I was five months|in the hospital with rheumatic fever.
{36873}{36933}Is that all?|Then what are you complaining about?
{36938}{36986}It's ruined my health.|I can't work.
{36991}{37018}What do you work at?
{37035}{37068}I was a dancer.
{37100}{37128}A dancer!
{37136}{37176}A member of the Empire ballet.
{37231}{37271}And I thought you were a...
{37284}{37337}So, you're a ballet dancer.
{37354}{37434}Pardon me, we haven't met formally.|What is your name?
{37448}{37526}Thereza Ambrose.|But I'm called Terry.
{37538}{37631}Charming. How do you do.|I'm also in the business.
{37636}{37696}My name is Calvero.|Perhaps you've heard of me.
{37722}{37756}You're not the great comedian?
{37771}{37841}I was.|However, we won't go into that.
{37846}{37914}Whatever brought you|to this state of affairs?
{37919}{37949}Ill health, mostly.
{37960}{38016}Then we'll have to get you well.
{38036}{38095}It isn't the ideal spot|for convalescing,
{38115}{38162}but you're welcome to it,
{38170}{38260}if you can put up with being|Mrs. Calvero. In name only!
{38278}{38309}It won't inconvenience you?
{38317}{38372}Not at all.|I've had five wives already.
{38378}{38420}One more or less|makes no difference.
{38425}{38467}Moreover, I've arrived at the age
{38472}{38576}where platonic friendship can be|sustained on the highest moral plane.
{38709}{38834}Now let me see, your mother was|a dressmaker and your father a lord?
{38843}{38898}The fourth son of a lord.|That's quite different.
{38966}{38999}How is it he married your mother?
{39010}{39048}She was|one of the family housemaids.
{39067}{39113}Sounds like a novelette.
{39118}{39196}- Did he have any money?|- No, the family cut him off.
{39212}{39264}So your sister's|the only one living?
{39272}{39318}Yes, and she's in South America.
{39375}{39463}Tell me, was it just ill health|that made you do what you did?
{39491}{39539}- That, and...|- And what?
{39602}{39655}The utter futility of everything.
{39687}{39742}I see it even in flowers,
{39762}{39810}hear it in music.
{39831}{39880}All life aimless,|without meaning.
{39905}{39948}What do you want a meaning for?
{39967}{40021}Life is a desire, not a meaning.
{40033}{40091}Desire is the theme of all life!
{40096}{40196}It makes a rose want to be a rose,|and want to grow like that.
{40209}{40293}And a rock want to contain itself|and remain like that.
{40377}{40408}What are you smiling about?
{40425}{40470}Your imitation|of a rose and a rock.
{40534}{40565}I can imitate anything.
{40570}{40654}Ever seen a Japanese tree?|They're lopsided, they grow this way.
{40752}{40801}Of course pansies grow this way.
{40847}{40897}The dark ones frown and go like that.
{40979}{41043}However, the meaning of anything
{41048}{41112}is merely other words|for the same thing.
{41118}{41215}After all, a rose is a rose.|Not bad, should be quoted.
{41301}{41369}Think how meaningless|life was a moment ago.
{41375}{41458}Now you have|a temporary husband and a home.
{41473}{41587}Here's your drinking water,|and in case of any emergencies,
{41595}{41678}the first door on the left,|the same on each floor.
{41729}{41759}Good night.
{42949}{42984}{y:i}Spring is here!
{43027}{43073}{y:i}Birds are calling
{43106}{43163}{y:i}Skunks are crawling
{43171}{43279}{y:i}Wagging their tails for love
{43329}{43371}{y:i}Spring is here!
{43403}{43453}{y:i}Whales are churning
{43482}{43540}{y:i}Worms are squirming
{43552}{43656}{y:i}Wagging their tails for love
{43683}{43746}{y:i}What is this thing|{y:i}Of which I sing
{43751}{43792}{y:i}That makes us all bewitched?
{43797}{43871}{y:i}What is this thing|{y:i}That comes in Spring
{43876}{43926}{y:i}That gives us all the itch?
{43973}{44012}{y:i}Oh, it's love
{44018}{44080}{y:i}It's love,|{y:i}It's love love love love
{45077}{45134}Pardon me,|but have you a fly swatter?
{45160}{45194}I beg your pardon.
{45208}{45257}If you beg around here,|I'll call the police.
{45262}{45309}I repeat, I beg your pardon.
{45314}{45349}I don't care what you've eaten.
{45356}{45376}I've eaten nothing.
{45381}{45434}Poor dear.|Here, get a sandwich.
{45439}{45505}- Sir, I demand an apology!|- I don't know you.
{45510}{45564}Who are your people?|Are you in the social register?
{45570}{45648}- My name happens to be Smith.|- Never heard of them.
{45653}{45703}That shows you're asinine.
{45708}{45746}I should have worn my overcoat.
{45751}{45799}You've interrupted me|in the middle of my sonnet.
{45804}{45834}In the middle of your what?
{45839}{45894}Not in the middle of my what,|the middle of my sonnet.
{45904}{45945}My ode to a worm.
{45978}{46056}Oh worm, why do you turn|into the earth from me?
{46061}{46096}'Tis Spring! Oh worm!
{46101}{46138}Lift up your head
{46144}{46212}whichever end that be|and smile at the sun
{46218}{46293}untwine your naked form|and with your tail, fling!
{46298}{46337}High the dirt in ecstasy!
{46342}{46442}'Tis Spring! 'Tis Spring!|'Tis Spring!
{46500}{46565}Ridiculous!|A worm smiling at the sun!
{46571}{46628}- Why not?|- A worm can't smile.
{46633}{46677}Did you ever appeal|to its sense of humor?
{46682}{46712}- Of course not.|- Well then!
{46717}{46765}But it doesn't make sense.
{46783}{46839}Why should poetry|have to make sense?
{46845}{46924}Don't you know there's such a thing|as poetic license?
{46929}{46979}I've given you no license.
{46984}{47012}Oh no, don't!
{47017}{47075}This thing is so much bigger|than ourselves!
{47080}{47162}At this moment|I'm grasping the meaning of life.
{47181}{47226}What a waste of energy.
{47233}{47316}What is this urge|that makes life go on and on?
{47322}{47397}You're right.|What does it all mean?
{47410}{47437}Where are we going?
{47442}{47502}You're going south.|Your hand's in my pocket.
{47520}{47544}Naughty.
{47549}{47645}- How did it get there?|- Pure magnetism, old dear.
{47731}{47806}Why are you antagonistic|towards me?
{47811}{47850}Must we be serious?
{47855}{47901}You make it difficult to know you.
{47906}{47946}Read my memoirs|in the Police Gazette.
{47951}{48009}- You're a funny man.|- Why?
{48014}{48062}To talk about worms|the way you do.
{48067}{48145}Why not? Even flies are romantic.
{48150}{48194}- Flies?|- Oh yes.
{48199}{48253}Coming from the stable|to the table,
{48258}{48355}chasing each other over the sugar|and meeting in the butter.
{48366}{48428}- You've read ''The Life of the Bee''?|- No, I haven't.
{48433}{48505}The bee's behavior in the beehive|is unbelievable.
{48510}{48545}Really?
{48556}{48602}- Gezundheit!|- It certainly does.
{48607}{48676}- I beg your pardon?|- The dress. It goes on tight.
{48686}{48766}You're awful dusty tonight, my dear.|Turn around.
{48777}{48850}Where do they keep you?|On the top shelf or something?
{48888}{48978}Fuller's earth? Johnson's powder?|I know! Cornstarch.
{48983}{49080}Just think!|All life motivated by love.
{49085}{49113}How beautiful.
{49118}{49155}- By no means beautiful.|- It certainly is.
{49164}{49242}No, it's vile, wicked, awful!|But wonderful.
{49247}{49298}- I like you.|- Really?
{49303}{49359}You're sensitive. You feel things.
{49364}{49393}Don't encourage me.
{49398}{49501}It's true. So few people|have the capacity to feel.
{49506}{49544}Or the opportunity.
{49633}{49659}Allow me.
{49674}{49726}Use it only for what you wish.
{50367}{50397}Come in.
{50470}{50518}Good morning. How do you feel?
{50524}{50565}- Better, thank you.|- Good.
{50574}{50610}What a day!
{50621}{50707}The sun's shining, the kettle's|singing, and we've paid the rent.
{50734}{50799}There'll be an earthquake,|I know it.
{50832}{50871}What would you like for breakfast?
{50876}{50965}We have eggs, bacon,|cheese, spring onions...
{50991}{51027}That's broken my dream!
{51032}{51106}I dreamt we did an act together,|all about Spring.
{51111}{51133}Interesting.
{51138}{51221}I get lots of ideas in my dreams,|then I wake up and forget them.
{51240}{51331}You know, I've been dreaming a lot|about the theater lately.
{51336}{51388}Doing my old acts all over again.
{51473}{51534}Kippers. Aren't they superb!
{51641}{51665}What's wrong?
{51712}{51802}It's my legs! I tried to get up|this morning and I collapsed.
{51807}{51848}I can't even stand.
{51872}{51904}You got up too soon.
{51909}{51995}No, it's not that.|I have no feeling in them.
{52000}{52076}They're paralyzed. I know it!
{52087}{52164}Don't upset yourself.|After breakfast we'll call the doctor.
{52169}{52205}I'd better go to a hospital.
{52210}{52269}You know best,|but see what the doctor says first.
{52274}{52332}I can't stay here,|causing you all this trouble.
{52337}{52358}I'm not complaining.
{52379}{52441}You should, I'm such a bore.
{52459}{52531}But it's not my fault.|You would save my life.
{52545}{52590}Well, we all make mistakes!
{52637}{52675}I'm sorry.
{52688}{52804}You should be. A young girl like you|wanting to throw your life away.
{52836}{52899}When you're my age,|you'll want to hang on to it.
{52918}{52948}Why?
{52954}{53024}Well, at this stage of the game|life gets to be a habit.
{53050}{53086}A hopeless one.
{53091}{53159}Then live without hope.|Live for the moment.
{53181}{53236}There are still, there are still...
{53245}{53283}There are still wonderful moments.
{53288}{53321}But if you've lost your health!
{53326}{53441}My dear, I was given up for dead|six months ago, but I fought back.
{53446}{53485}That's what you must do.
{53498}{53539}I'm tired of fighting.
{53558}{53661}Because you're fighting yourself.|You won't give yourself a chance.
{53687}{53750}But the fight for happiness|is beautiful.
{53755}{53780}Happiness...
{53785}{53859}- There is such a thing.|- Where?
{53865}{53972}Listen, as a child I used to complain|to my father about not having toys
{53977}{54105}and he would say "this"|{y:i}is the greatest toy ever created.
{54110}{54180}Here lies|the secret of all happiness.
{54202}{54279}To hear you talk, no one would|ever think you were a comedian.
{54286}{54392}I'm beginning to realize that.|It's the reason I can't get a job.
{54443}{54471}Why?
{54517}{54565}Because they have no imagination.
{54577}{54649}Or think because I'm getting|on in years I'm old, all washed up.
{54689}{54776}Never! After hearing you talk.
{54804}{54851}Perhaps I drank too much.
{54863}{54904}There's usually a reason|for drinking.
{54956}{55000}Unhappiness, I suppose.
{55044}{55091}No, I'm used to that.
{55142}{55206}It was more complicated.
{55233}{55315}As a man gets on in years|he wants to live deeply.
{55342}{55455}A feeling of sad dignity comes upon|him, and that's fatal for a comic.
{55467}{55501}It affected my work.
{55506}{55576}I lost contact with the audience,|couldn't warm up to them.
{55606}{55662}And that's what started me drinking.
{55667}{55712}I had to have it before I went on.
{55717}{55796}It got so I couldn't be funny|without it. The more I drank...
{55817}{55864}It became a vicious circle.
{55871}{55895}What happened?
{55900}{55953}A heart attack. I almost died.
{55971}{56015}And you're still drinking?
{56020}{56074}Occasionally, if I think of things.
{56087}{56157}The wrong things I suppose,|as you do.
{56179}{56232}What would you like|for your breakfast?
{56246}{56308}What a sad business, being funny.
{56330}{56390}Very sad if they won't laugh.
{56403}{56441}But it's a thrill when they do.
{56446}{56511}To look out there|and see them all laughing,
{56536}{56618}to hear that roar go up,|waves of laughter coming at you.
{56626}{56680}Let's talk of something|more cheerful.
{56688}{56744}Besides I want to forget the public.
{56768}{56812}Never. You love them too much.
{56817}{56877}Maybe I love them,|but I don't admire them.
{56882}{56910}I think you do.
{56922}{56989}As individuals, yes.|There's greatness in everyone.
{57006}{57081}But as a crowd, they're like|a monster without a head
{57086}{57151}that never knows which way|it's going to turn.
{57167}{57219}It can be prodded in any direction.
{57238}{57344}I keep forgetting about breakfast.|How about some poached eggs?
{57377}{57402}Come in.
{57458}{57510}- A telegram.|- Oh, thank you.
{57849}{57888}Are you all right?
{57895}{57947}This is what I've been waiting for.
{57965}{58002}Good news?
{58022}{58071}Redfern, my agent, wants to see me.
{58086}{58117}Wonderful!
{58137}{58212}You're right.|This is the turning point.
{58220}{58302}Those managers have been holding|out on me, breaking my morale.
{58307}{58351}But now they want me!
{58369}{58493}And now I'll make them pay!|For their contempt and indifference.
{58498}{58546}No, I'll be gracious.
{58551}{58614}That'll be more dignified,|put them in their place.
{58620}{58657}I'm to be at Redfern's office|at three.
{58662}{58723}I'll call the doctor|and tell him about your legs.
{58728}{58772}But I forgot your breakfast!
{58800}{58844}How about some nice kippers?
{59284}{59343}Nothing for you, or you, or you...
{59397}{59429}Nothing for you.
{59664}{59711}- Anyone waiting?|- Miss Parker.
{59716}{59738}Anyone else?
{59743}{59814}Yes, Calvero.|He's been here since three.
{59819}{59875}I forgot all about him.|Show him in.
{60021}{60090}Good afternoon, Calvero.|Sit down.
{60095}{60206}Sorry about yesterday. I was held up|over some important business.
{60216}{60253}However, I've good news for you.
{60264}{60313}I can get you a week|at Middlesex Music Hall.
{60324}{60359}At what terms?
{60364}{60424}I don't know yet,|but I wouldn't bother about that.
{60429}{60462}No bother at all.
{60480}{60549}However, if money's no object,
{60554}{60624}- what billing am I to get?|- I wouldn't bother about that either.
{60638}{60699}I'm not to get star billing|at Middlesex?
{60707}{60740}I'm not sure|we can book you there.
{60753}{60817}You think I'd allow those managers|to throw in my name
{60822}{60925}with a lot of nondescripts|just to build up their reputation!
{60930}{60973}Calvero's still a name|to conjure with!
{60992}{61052}You're mistaken.|Today it means nothing.
{61068}{61100}Then why do they want me?
{61105}{61165}They don't want you.|They're doing me a favor.
{61186}{61258}Very kind of them.|I hope you appreciate the fact.
{61286}{61343}I'm going to be perfectly frank|with you.
{61348}{61421}I've been talking Calvero|to them for over six months.
{61438}{61509}Your name is poison.|They don't want to touch you.
{61514}{61554}They couldn't if they tried.
{61608}{61694}I'm sorry, but you must|be made to realize the facts.
{61740}{61794}You're succeeding splendidly.
{61816}{61896}I'm trying to help, that's all.|But you must cooperate.
{61981}{62027}Whatever you say, I'll do.
{62032}{62063}That's the spirit.
{62068}{62143}As soon as the contract's confirmed,|I'll let you know.
{62288}{62335}However, cheer up.
{62376}{62471}If my name is poison to them,|I won't use it.
{62476}{62555}- I'll go by another name.|- I think that's a splendid idea.
{62808}{62863}Well doctor, how is our patient?
{62877}{62980}The condition is cleared up, but|I find nothing wrong with her legs.
{62993}{63038}Didn't she tell you|she's had rheumatic fever?
{63043}{63077}Yes, but I don't think she has.
{63084}{63143}The heart would have been affected|and it's perfectly sound.
{63163}{63217}I believe it's a case|of psycho-anesthesia.
{63225}{63249}What's that?
{63266}{63344}A form of hysteria that has|the characteristics of paralysis
{63349}{63381}without being so.
{63386}{63408}How do you account for it?
{63420}{63496}In her case, I'd say|it's psychological, self-imposed.
{63501}{63583}Having failed at suicide,|she's decided to become a cripple.
{63598}{63634}Is there any way I can help?
{63639}{63737}Primarily she must help herself.|It's a case for a psychologist.
{63744}{63777}Doctor Freud.
{63799}{63836}Well, I'll see what I can do.
{63861}{63900}- Good day, Doctor.|- Good day.
{64032}{64083}Tell me more|about your sister Louise.
{64118}{64162}There's nothing more to tell.
{64184}{64259}When she couldn't find work|she was driven to the street.
{64280}{64334}How old were you|when you discovered this?
{64339}{64368}About eight.
{64411}{64444}Tell me about it.
{64458}{64541}It was after my mother died.|I loved Louise.
{64546}{64630}She was everything to me,|supported me, had me taught dancing.
{64639}{64702}Then one day I realized|what she was doing.
{64714}{64768}I was coming home from dancing|with the other girls
{64773}{64885}and I saw her, and the other girls|saw her, walking the street.
{64900}{64937}What did you do?
{64965}{65013}I just ran and wept.
{65025}{65063}Ran and wept.
{65091}{65121}Then what happened?
{65140}{65177}I tried to forget.
{65188}{65284}I was sent to boarding school. At 16,|I left and joined the Empire Ballet.
{65298}{65376}Louise went to South America.|I haven't heard from her since.
{65424}{65505}Up to that time,|you had no trouble with your legs?
{65510}{65537}No.
{65560}{65593}When did it start?
{65599}{65680}About two years later.|After Melise joined the ballet.
{65714}{65736}Who's Melise?
{65741}{65790}One of the girls|from the dancing school.
{65807}{65865}One who was with you|when you found out about Louise?
{65945}{66011}Mr. Freud would say|that since meeting this girl again,
{66016}{66062}you don't want to dance.
{66067}{66098}Why?
{66104}{66168}You've associated it|with the unhappy life of your sister
{66173}{66255}who paid for your lessons|through a life of shame.
{66261}{66315}You've been ashamed to dance|ever since.
{66322}{66380}I'd despise myself|if I thought that.
{66385}{66425}That's the trouble, you do.
{66430}{66512}That's the trouble with the world.|We all despise ourselves.
{66580}{66617}Streetwalking!
{66666}{66731}We're all grubbing for a living,|the best of us.
{66762}{66821}All a part of the human crusade,
{66855}{66892}written in water.
{66910}{66944}But enough of that.
{66960}{66991}Ever been in love?
{67007}{67043}No, not really.
{67063}{67112}I think it was more|a feeling of pity.
{67119}{67179}The plot thickens.|Tell me about it.
{67202}{67295}It's a ridiculous story.|I hardly knew the man.
{67308}{67368}It was something I built up|in my own mind.
{67373}{67421}{y:i}It was after I came out|{y:i}of the hospital.
{67455}{67526}{y:i}I took a job|{y:i}at Sardou's stationary shop.
{67545}{67638}{y:i}He was one of the customers,|{y:i}a young American.
{67660}{67701}{y:i}He used to buy music paper
{67706}{67779}{y:i}in large and small amounts,|{y:i}according to his finances.
{67793}{67891}{y:i}He seemed so lonely,|{y:i}so helpless and shy.
{67910}{67963}{y:i}There was something pathetic|{y:i}about him.
{67975}{68056}{y:i}I wouldn't have noticed him,|{y:i}but someone tried to elbow in.
{68065}{68146}{y:i}When I ignored the other man,|{y:i}he smiled in gratitude.
{68174}{68260}{y:i}The old charwoman who worked where|{y:i}he lived told me he was Mr. Neville,
{68265}{68344}{y:i}a composer,|{y:i}and that he occupied the top room.
{68357}{68437}{y:i}There were days I knew he went|{y:i}without food to buy music paper.
{68442}{68486}{y:i}I could see it in his eyes.
{68491}{68528}{y:i}The haggard look.
{68542}{68585}{y:i}Sometimes I'd throw in|{y:i}a few extra sheets.
{68590}{68648}{y:i}Once I gave him more|{y:i}than his proper change,
{68653}{68718}{y:i}which he might have noticed,|{y:i}but I wasn't sure.
{68723}{68838}{y:i}Often after work I'd stroll by his|{y:i}house and hear him playing piano,
{68843}{68922}{y:i}repeating musical passages|{y:i}over and over again.
{68934}{69032}{y:i}And I'd stand listening,|{y:i}excited and melancholy.
{69567}{69624}Well, what then?
{69731}{69779}Then for weeks I never saw him.
{69808}{69910}The charwoman told me he was ill.|Creditors had taken his piano.
{69927}{70020}{y:i}Eventually he came into the shop|{y:i}looking very pale
{70029}{70103}{y:i}and asked for two shillings worth|{y:i}of large orchestral sheets,
{70108}{70174}{y:i}placing a two shilling piece|{y:i}on the counter.
{70187}{70233}{y:i}I knew it was his last.
{70254}{70337}{y:i}If I could only help him!|{y:i}If I only dared!
{70344}{70416}{y:i}I could lend him money.|{y:i}I wanted to tell him so.
{70448}{70487}{y:i}But I was also shy.
{70521}{70585}{y:i}Nevertheless|{y:i}I was determined to help.
{70594}{70680}{y:i}I gave him some extra sheets|{y:i}and as he was about leave
{70685}{70713}{y:i}I called him back:
{70718}{70766}{y:i}You've forgotten your change.
{70773}{70820}{y:i}There must be a mistake, he said.
{70825}{70857}{y:i}Not at all, I answered.
{70862}{70933}{y:i}You gave me half a crown,|{y:i}here's sixpence change.
{70947}{71026}{y:i}Then I realized I had created|{y:i}a ridiculous situation.
{71033}{71103}{y:i}To make matters worse|{y:i}in came Mr. Sardou:
{71108}{71156}{y:i}Can I be of any assistance?
{71161}{71204}{y:i}It isn't necessary, I said quickly.
{71209}{71281}{y:i}The gentleman gave me half a crown|{y:i}and forgot his change.
{71286}{71353}{y:i}However,|{y:i}Mr. Sardou made him take it.
{71358}{71433}{y:i}But as soon as he left|{y:i}Mr. Sardou went through the till
{71438}{71510}{y:i}and finding no half crown there,|{y:i}became suspicious.
{71515}{71596}The discrepancy was discovered|and I was discharged.
{71601}{71625}What did you do then?
{71630}{71733}I tried to get back to dancing,|then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.
{71758}{71813}Did you ever see|this young composer again?
{71827}{71918}Yes, five months later.|After I came out of the hospital.
{71931}{71986}I saw him from the gallery|of the Albert Hall.
{71991}{72070}His symphony was played there.|It was a great success.
{72075}{72129}Of course you're in love with him.
{72138}{72171}I don't even know him.
{72176}{72258}You will.|Life is a local affair.
{72264}{72306}I can see it happening.
{72330}{72407}You'll be at the height|of your success and he'll call on you,
{72412}{72473}and tell you he met you|at some super party.
{72478}{72509}Won't I recognize him?
{72514}{72590}Oh no. He's grown a beard.|Musicians do.
{72639}{72721}He'll tell you|he's composed a ballet for you.
{72730}{72815}And you'll realize who he is,|you'll tell him who you are
{72820}{72892}and how you met,|and how you waited on him.
{72906}{72966}And gave him extra music sheets.
{72981}{73072}And that night you'll dine together
{73087}{73181}on a balcony|overlooking the Thames.
{73203}{73240}It'll be summer.
{73257}{73321}And you'll be wearing|pink mousseline.
{73337}{73404}And he'll be conscious|of its fragrance.
{73435}{73519}And all London|will be dreamy and beautiful.
{73542}{73619}And in the elegant melancholy|of twilight,
{73624}{73703}as the candles flutter|and make your eyes dance,
{73720}{73767}he will tell you he loves you.
{73782}{73854}And you will tell him|you have always loved him.
{73922}{73957}Where am I?
{73998}{74068}Yes, life can be wonderful|if you're not afraid of it.
{74119}{74213}All it needs is courage, imagination
{74286}{74324}and a little dough.
{74412}{74441}Now what's the matter?
{74451}{74517}I'll never dance again!|I'm a cripple.
{74525}{74584}- Pure hysteria! It's in your mind.|- It isn't true.
{74589}{74647}- Otherwise you'd fight!|- What is there to fight for?
{74652}{74706}Ah, you see? You admit it.
{74713}{74772}What is there to fight for?|Everything!
{74784}{74829}Life itself! Isn't that enough?
{74834}{74933}To be lived, suffered, enjoyed!|What is there to fight for?
{74938}{75000}Life is a beautiful,|magnificent thing.
{75005}{75051}Even to a jellyfish.
{75071}{75165}What is there to fight for?|You have your art, your dancing!
{75176}{75221}But I can't dance without legs!
{75230}{75274}I know a man without arms
{75279}{75382}who can play a scherzo on a violin|and does it all with his toes.
{75387}{75453}The trouble is you won't fight.|You've given in.
{75458}{75516}Continually dwelling|on sickness and death!
{75521}{75550}But,
{75558}{75623}there's something|just as inevitable as death
{75628}{75680}and that's life.|Life, life, life!
{75691}{75737}Think of the power|that's in the universe!
{75742}{75809}Moving the earth, growing the trees!
{75814}{75871}And that's the same power|within you.
{75876}{75969}If you'd only have courage|and the will to use it.
{76025}{76050}Good night!
{76208}{76271}Faster, faster.|Come on, dance!
{76321}{76349}Beautiful.
{76463}{76501}I fooled you that time.|Come on.
{76676}{76714}Take that away.|Come on!
{76903}{76935}What's the news?
{76943}{76992}Europe in a race for armaments.
{77004}{77042}Anything interesting?
{77047}{77121}A write-up about Mr. and|Mrs. Zanzig, the mind readers.
{77126}{77163}I played with them years ago.
{77168}{77244}They say they can transfer thoughts|to each other.
{77249}{77270}Nonsense!
{77275}{77299}Then how is it done?
{77304}{77399}Not transference. I was with him once|when he sent his wife a telegram.
{77541}{77566}More coffee?
{77576}{77609}Just a half cup.
{77799}{77829}I'm sorry, I didn't intend...
{77834}{77886}Oh no, it's good exercise.
{77990}{78068}Look at you,|hopping around like a two year-old.
{78093}{78139}I think there's an improvement.
{78145}{78172}Definitely.
{78238}{78320}- But I get so nervous doing nothing.|- Nothing?
{78325}{78373}I welcome every new hole|in your socks.
{78396}{78454}Housework and cooking,|what more do you want?
{78459}{78494}Keep fighting, that's all.
{78514}{78600}That reminds me,|Mrs. Alsop's on the warpath again.
{78605}{78676}She wants to know how long|I'm going to stay.
{78687}{78745}Tell her to mind her own business!|We pay our rent.
{78750}{78782}Oh no, there's a month owing.
{78805}{78882}Since they postponed the Middlesex|opening, it's upset everything.
{78888}{78943}Don't worry.|I can handle the old girl.
{78948}{79020}All she needs|is a little pinch and a pat.
{79036}{79083}Don't you think|I should go to a hospital?
{79088}{79116}I do not.
{79144}{79199}You'd have one problem|off your hands.
{79228}{79273}After the Middlesex,|our problems are over.
{79287}{79427}You know, preaching and moralizing|to you has really affected me.
{79439}{79490}I'm beginning to believe it myself.
{79500}{79560}I haven't taken a drink|since I've known you.
{79565}{79590}Wonderful.
{79595}{79654}And I'm not going to,|even on opening night.
{79659}{79698}You don't need it.
{79703}{79772}You're excruciatingly funny|without it.
{79780}{79814}Oh, yes.
{79847}{79918}- What's that?|- Maybe a letter from Redfern.
{80666}{80709}Just the man I want to see!
{80726}{80762}How thrilling!
{80822}{80900}This is no joke. When are you|getting rid of that girl upstairs?
{80905}{80963}- Don't be jealous.|- Jealous!
{80968}{81016}What have you done to your hair?
{81021}{81061}Where are your spit curls?
{81075}{81151}Never mind all that!|You owe me four weeks' rent.
{81167}{81220}- Have I denied the fact?|- You'd better not.
{81249}{81360}Sybil, you really want to hurt me,|don't you? You little minx.
{81365}{81396}Behave yourself!
{81401}{81454}I get so full of nonsense|when I'm around you.
{81459}{81492}You fool!
{81515}{81563}What about that girl upstairs?
{81569}{81608}Now, now. Be patient.
{81613}{81651}You'd better|get rid of her this week.
{81658}{81730}Bear with me. I know|it's been a trial for both of us.
{81735}{81787}Both of us!|Who are you kidding?
{81792}{81819}You!
{81825}{81898}You wonderful|little plum pudding, you!
{81940}{81985}But we must behave ourselves.
{82240}{82283}That takes care of the rent.
{82288}{82375}- Was there any post?|- No. That was for Mrs. Alsop.
{82584}{82662}{y:i}Oh for the life of a sardine|{y:i}That is the life for me
{82667}{82714}{y:i}Cavorting and spawning|{y:i}every morning
{82719}{82754}{y:i}Under the deep blue sea
{82759}{82846}{y:i}To have no fear of a fisherman's net|{y:i}Oh what fun to be gay and all wet
{82851}{82936}{y:i}Oh for the life of a sardine|{y:i}That is the life for me
{83097}{83123}Funny thing,
{83128}{83171}I dreamt I was a sardine.
{83180}{83243}I dreamt it was lunchtime,|and I was, uh...
{83248}{83307}swimming along,|looking for a little bit of bait
{83312}{83379}and I found myself passing|a large bed of kelp.
{83408}{83459}And there on it, I mean in it,
{83464}{83538}was the prettiest little fin|you've ever seen.
{83558}{83634}That's what we call them|in the fish world: fins.
{83648}{83691}The way she maneuvered her tail,
{83709}{83758}with such finesse.
{83770}{83808}She seemed to be in trouble.
{83929}{84016}{y:i}All right old boy,|{y:i}let's all go home.
{84021}{84095}Yeah, you're right. Good night.
{84317}{84350}I beg your pardon.
{84518}{84575}Blasted! These shoes are too tight.
{84916}{84958}Good night.
{86583}{86626}What are you doing up so late?
{86661}{86702}I just couldn't sleep.
{86737}{86815}Then I saw the partition doors open,|so I got up an hour ago.
{86840}{86875}Some hot soup?
{86894}{86926}No, thanks.
{86957}{86993}You look tired.
{86998}{87023}Do I?
{87046}{87083}I know you're worried,
{87106}{87207}but the Middlesex contract's signed,|it's just the delay.
{87226}{87271}There's no delay.
{87304}{87338}What do you mean?
{87350}{87386}It happened tonight.
{87415}{87449}The Middlesex?
{87492}{87535}Why didn't you let me know?
{87552}{87622}I didn't want you to go through|the suspense of it.
{87657}{87772}Then forget everything now,|and get a good night's rest.
{87816}{87865}They walked out on me.
{87927}{87988}They haven't done that|since I was a beginner.
{87993}{88037}The cycle's complete.
{88065}{88134}But you've changed your name!|They didn't know you.
{88176}{88261}No, I wasn't funny.|The trouble is, I was sober.
{88279}{88340}I should have been drunk|before going on.
{88351}{88407}I still insist|they didn't know you.
{88412}{88454}Just as well they didn't.
{88476}{88559}Naturally! You can't expect too much|the first performance.
{88564}{88617}You haven't worked in a long time.
{88622}{88706}But you'll see, tonight|when you go back it'll be different.
{88718}{88757}I'm not going back.
{88795}{88823}Why?
{88838}{88931}They've terminated the contract.
{88969}{89018}But they can't do that!
{89027}{89085}They can. They have.
{89117}{89195}You were engaged for the week!|You can insist.
{89260}{89335}It's no use. I'm finished.
{89362}{89395}Through!
{89437}{89473}Nonsense.
{89495}{89586}Are you, Calvero, going to allow|one performance to destroy you?
{89591}{89657}Of course not!|You're too great an artist.
{89662}{89771}Now's the time to show them|what you're made of. Time to fight!
{89785}{89864}Remember what you told me,|standing there by that window?
{89869}{89913}Remember what you said?
{89918}{89999}About the power of the universe|moving the earth?
{90004}{90090}Growing the trees,|and that power being within you?
{90126}{90213}Now is the time to use that power,|and to fight!
{90269}{90320}Calvero, look! I'm walking!
{90339}{90364}I'm walking!
{90418}{90456}I'm walking!
{91292}{91370}Just think, I can walk!
{91385}{91461}Well, I can't any further.|I have to quit right here.
{91481}{91522}Do you realize|it's almost five o'clock?
{91527}{91604}I know. But I couldn't stay|in that room another minute.
{91609}{91643}I don't blame you.
{91674}{91707}Cheer up.
{91742}{91814}Look, the dawn is breaking.
{91883}{91923}That's a good omen.
{91931}{91999}I know it. It will be.
{92020}{92062}It must be.
{92108}{92198}Don't be discouraged.|You'll get on your feet again.
{92203}{92233}On my what again?
{92238}{92289}But think how fortunate we are!
{92294}{92340}At least we both have our health.
{92345}{92450}Now I can get a job. There's always|chorus work to keep us going.
{92468}{92495}Us?
{92500}{92530}Yes.
{92550}{92575}Us.
{92601}{92678}You and me. Together.
{95149}{95190}- Mr. Bodalink!|- What is it?
{95196}{95251}- The front office, sir.|- Thank you.
{95287}{95381}Terry, I was about to leave you|a note about Calvero.
{95386}{95461}Have him see me tomorrow morning|before your audition.
{95466}{95517}- He's all set for the part.|- Wonderful!
{96589}{96617}Just a minute.
{96647}{96712}Why, Terry!|I didn't hear you come in.
{96720}{96748}How could you?
{96766}{96829}Allow me. My friends,
{96834}{96872}Mademoiselle Thereza.
{96903}{96929}How do you do.
{96961}{97035}We're just having a little beer,|Bach and Beethoven.
{97051}{97097}Isn't it rather late for music?
{97107}{97153}Not if we play a nocturne.
{97172}{97221}Proceed with the butchery,
{97234}{97329}only make it soft,|sentimental, largo.
{97342}{97427}- I'll stick to beer if you don't mind.|- Coming up!
{97437}{97467}But what will Mrs. Alsop say?
{97472}{97559}A fine thing! After climbing up|three flights of stairs,
{97564}{97684}I've just discovered I've got nothing|but a lot of empty beer bottles.
{97703}{97776}Why, Terry, is the show out?
{97781}{97836}I didn't realize it was that late.
{97841}{97873}It's very late.
{97878}{97927}That's our cue, we'd better go.
{97932}{98015}You're not going!|We were just about to celebrate.
{98020}{98089}- But it's almost one o'clock.|- So what?
{98095}{98128}Wait a minute!
{98133}{98229}Calvero gave me three horses|and I doubled up on them!
{98234}{98307}Now that only happens|once in a lifetime.
{98320}{98423}Wait a minute. Those stairs|are steep. I'll lead the way.
{98452}{98568}That's all right, I can handle myself.|Don't you worry about me.
{98752}{98783}Good night.
{99252}{99319}I'm sorry, my dear. I'm drunk.
{99327}{99414}It's your health I'm worried about.|You know what the doctor said.
{99419}{99522}Yes, I shouldn't drink.|It's bad for the heart.
{99539}{99585}What about the mind?
{99603}{99706}I suppose that should be clear and|alert so I can contemplate the future.
{99720}{99796}The prospects of joining|those gray-haired nymphs
{99801}{99866}that sleep|on the Thames embankment at night.
{99871}{99925}You'll never join them|while I'm alive.
{99930}{100019}Oh, I forgot to get your supper!|I'm no good.
{100024}{100116}I'll get it later on.|First I'm going to put you to bed.
{100121}{100172}But you've had nothing to eat.
{100188}{100224}Did you take your medicine?
{100232}{100261}What medicine?
{100266}{100337}You didn't.|It's to give you an appetite.
{100342}{100385}I've quenched my appetite.
{100390}{100427}You'll be ill again,|if you don't eat.
{100435}{100499}Well, I much prefer to drink.
{100515}{100584}A man's true character comes out|when he's drunk.
{100589}{100636}Me, I'm funnier.
{100662}{100711}Too bad I didn't drink|at the Middlesex.
{100716}{100760}I've got good news for you.
{100765}{100840}Mr. Bodalink wants to see you|tomorrow morning.
{100846}{100878}Who's he?
{100883}{100972}Our dance director. He wants you|to play a clown in the new ballet.
{100979}{101029}I'm through clowning.
{101034}{101106}Life isn't a gag anymore.|I can't see the joke.
{101123}{101182}From now on, I'm a retired humorist.
{101187}{101236}You'll feel differently|in the morning.
{101241}{101285}No, I hate the theatre!
{101305}{101379}Someday I'll buy|an acre of ground somewhere
{101387}{101476}and raise a few cut flowers,|and make a living that way.
{101746}{101823}What do you think?|It's all settled. I play the clown.
{101870}{101944}Let's sit down over here|and you can tell me all about it.
{102121}{102196}Of course, the salary isn't much.
{102220}{102254}Two pounds?
{102261}{102361}But it's a foot in the door.|Naturally I'm not using my own name.
{102372}{102463}This Bodalink's a nice chap.|Says you're quite a dancer.
{102468}{102550}If you'd have come to the theatre,|you might have known it.
{102565}{102626}Why didn't you tell me|you were auditioning?
{102631}{102676}I wanted to surprise you.
{102681}{102754}I'm not sure of the outcome.|It depends on Mr. Postant.
{102759}{102851}Postant!|I thought he'd retired years ago.
{102863}{102900}Why, do you know him?
{102912}{102983}Last time I worked for Postant,|I was the headline here.
{102991}{103025}Footlights!
{103524}{103558}Your hands are quite cold.
{103572}{103648}I think I've got the girl. Young,|sympathetic, a brilliant dancer.
{103653}{103700}Bring her on!
{103706}{103745}Thereza, please!
{103789}{103844}You understand|it's purely improvising.
{103849}{103917}That's how I always judge a dancer.
{103955}{103994}This is Thereza, Mr. Postant.
{103999}{104025}- How do you do.|- How do you do.
{104030}{104118}You'll be dancing to Mr. Neville's|music. Listen to it first.
{104151}{104209}This is Mr. Neville, our composer.
{104244}{104309}- How do you do.|- How do you do.
{104363}{104410}I believe we've met before.
{104427}{104459}Really?
{106950}{107037}It's 12:30, we'd better call lunch.|Lunch everybody! Back at 1:30.
{107052}{107134}Allow me to congratulate|the next prima ballerina.
{107139}{107208}You're sopping wet, my dear.|Get your coat.
{107237}{107309}Put in on and then|we'll talk business.
{107314}{107351}Allow me.
{107400}{107467}- May I also congratulate you?|- Thank you.
{107551}{107656}Come dear. We'll meet at my office|at 2:30 and fix up her contract.
{107661}{107687}But we're rehearsing at 2.
{107692}{107734}Make it 6, after rehearsal.
{107739}{107817}Run up to your dressing room|before you get a chill.
{107837}{107887}- Where's Neville?|- Coming!
{108057}{108122}{y:i}All right Frank,|{y:i}turn off those lights.
{108645}{108671}Here I am.
{108808}{108859}I was looking for you outside.
{108864}{108920}What are you doing|sitting in the dark?
{108947}{109028}I'd be ridiculous in the light.|Look at me, I'm shameless.
{109053}{109093}But I can't help it.
{109149}{109241}My dear, you are a true artist.
{109305}{109345}True artist.
{109428}{109490}This is absurd. Ridiculous.
{109649}{109696}I've waited for this moment.
{109733}{109766}I love you.
{109828}{109891}I've wanted to say it for so long.
{109907}{109994}Ever since the day you thought|I was a woman of the street.
{110014}{110058}You took me in,
{110080}{110114}cared for me,
{110144}{110188}saved my life,
{110219}{110258}inspired it.
{110271}{110333}But above all that,|I just love you.
{110357}{110438}Please, Calvero, marry me.
{110450}{110531}- What nonsense is this?|- It isn't nonsense.
{110564}{110617}My dear, I'm an old man.
{110622}{110668}I don't care what you are.
{110674}{110754}I love you.|That's all that matters.
{110870}{110915}Latest news, express!
{110921}{111000}While you're having lunch,|I'm going to see about my wig.
{111005}{111031}Then I'll go with you.
{111036}{111102}You'd better have lunch first.|I might be delayed.
{111111}{111150}I'll see you back at the theatre.
{111185}{111211}Have a good lunch.
{111308}{111342}Oh, hello there.
{111359}{111426}I'm the man at the piano|who played a moment ago.
{111455}{111486}It's quite crowded.
{111491}{111523}Always is at lunch time.
{111532}{111554}Two?
{111622}{111655}Very well.
{112048}{112082}Your order, please.
{112177}{112216}Bacon and eggs, toast and tea.
{112236}{112269}The same.
{112335}{112379}That's always safe.
{112411}{112461}Beautiful day to be rehearsing.
{112513}{112577}Although the papers|are predicting more rain.
{112582}{112616}Really?
{112717}{112745}What's the joke?
{112764}{112853}I finally have the chance to talk|to you and I've nothing to say.
{112868}{112923}What is more eloquent than silence?
{112953}{113028}- I'd better change tables.|- I won't bite.
{113046}{113149}I'm not too sure. I was|severely frostbitten a moment ago.
{113169}{113197}What do you mean?
{113202}{113258}This morning.|When we were introduced.
{113264}{113301}I don't understand.
{113317}{113386}My reception was rather cool,|I thought.
{113391}{113433}I still don't understand.
{113438}{113479}I'm sorry.
{113488}{113530}I seem to be getting|a little involved.
{113542}{113608}You see, I had an idea|that we'd met before.
{113617}{113656}Well, perhaps we have.
{113669}{113731}If we haven't,|then you have a twin sister.
{113755}{113783}Who is she?
{113794}{113845}Do you really want to know?
{113862}{113893}Yes.
{113922}{113971}A young girl|who used to work at Sardou's,
{113981}{114045}a stationary shop|where I bought music paper.
{114054}{114115}A very shy, reticent girl.
{114126}{114163}She seldom spoke.
{114185}{114249}But her smile was warm|and appealing.
{114279}{114329}I read many things into it.
{114366}{114465}I also was shy.|It was a bond between us.
{114478}{114542}She used to give me|extra music sheets,
{114550}{114606}and occasionally extra change.
{114620}{114723}Which, frankly, I accepted.|Hunger has no conscience.
{114758}{114824}The day after my symphony|played the Albert Hall,
{114841}{114870}I went back to the shop,
{114892}{114988}but she'd gone.|They said she'd left months ago.
{115031}{115069}You haven't seen her since?
{115079}{115110}Well, have I?
{115179}{115213}Yes, you have.
{115226}{115253}I know.
{115273}{115342}I lost my job giving you|those extra music sheets.
{115353}{115419}- You won't hold that against me?|- Of course not.
{115432}{115478}I was very young then.
{115484}{115521}You're very young now.
{115529}{115623}I don't know.|Soon I shall be an old married lady.
{115664}{115709}Then I wish you lots of happiness.
{115730}{115758}Thank you.
{115776}{115811}I wish that waitress would hurry.
{115858}{115934}Before we do the choreography,|I'll explain the story.
{115993}{116035}It's about Harlequinade.
{116040}{116121}Terry is Columbine.|She is dying in a London garret.
{116126}{116218}Harlequin, who is the lover,|and the clowns, are at her bedside.
{116224}{116272}She asks to be carried|to the window.
{116277}{116342}She wants to look upon the rooftops|one last time.
{116347}{116416}The clowns weep. She smiles.
{116421}{116479}Their clothes are not for sorrow|but for laughter.
{116484}{116538}She wants them to perform,|do their tricks.
{116552}{116593}The clowns can do their comedy.
{116598}{116647}- While she's dying?|- Yes.
{116652}{116692}Let me see, where am I?
{116757}{116821}As the clowns perform,|she becomes delirious.
{116826}{116901}Spirits of Columbines|dance before her.
{116919}{116984}Then she dies.|That's the first scene.
{116989}{117060}Next is the graveyard|where Columbine was buried.
{117065}{117134}Harlequin, her lover,|enters in the moonlight.
{117139}{117219}He tries to resurrect her|from the grave.
{117235}{117273}But he fails.
{117282}{117332}The spirits tell him not to grieve.
{117337}{117392}His love is not in the grave,|but everywhere.
{117413}{117465}Then Terry appears.
{117474}{117512}That's your solo, then the finale.
{117517}{117588}We'd better get a move on.|It's only 3 weeks to the opening.
{126963}{126994}Calvero!
{127048}{127071}What is it?
{127076}{127131}- How's it going?|- Wonderful. Thumbs up.
{127136}{127201}- I wish the dance was over.|- You've nothing to worry about.
{127206}{127251}I'm scared. Pray for me.
{127256}{127347}God helps those|who help themselves. Good luck.
{127737}{127802}- I can't go on!|- What?
{127807}{127861}My legs! I can't move!
{127866}{127889}It's nerves. Just move.
{127894}{127963}No, I can't move. I'm paralyzed!
{127968}{128039}Pure hysteria!|There's your cue, get on stage!
{128044}{128149}No, I'm falling!|It's my legs, they're paralyzed!
{128194}{128230}Get on that stage!
{128261}{128334}See? There's nothing wrong|with your legs.
{129056}{129174}Whoever you are, whatever it is,|just keep her going, that's all.
{129239}{129273}I've lost a button.
{129311}{129347}One of these.
{129375}{129414}It's all right.
{134857}{134937}Where's Calvero?|He told me to wait for him here.
{134942}{134995}I'll send the call boy|to look for him.
{135022}{135108}Supper is served.|You're sitting next to Mr. Postant.
{135158}{135237}Supper is now being served|in both lounges.
{135416}{135493}Come along, my dear.|You're next to me.
{135502}{135571}Bodalink, you're down there|my dear fellow.
{135762}{135809}Destiny must be a headwaitress.
{135814}{135843}Why?
{135850}{135898}She seats us together again.
{135928}{135972}She might be your nemesis.
{135991}{136043}I think I'll stand up|under the punishment.
{136056}{136139}However, my congratulations.|Tonight you were wonderful.
{136150}{136216}That's what they call|the old army game.
{136221}{136295}Neville, they tell me|the army's caught up with you.
{136340}{136374}You've joined the army?
{136381}{136478}On the contrary, the army joined me.|I was drafted.
{136483}{136505}That's awful!
{136510}{136577}I agree.|It's carrying the war too far.
{136582}{136654}However, there's the possibility|of joining up here.
{136683}{136712}Would you like to dance?
{136717}{136795}I appeal to your patriotism.|You can't refuse a soldier.
{136858}{136933}Governor, I remember|when you played Widow Twankey
{136938}{137026}at the Theatre Royal,|Birmingham, in 1890...
{137031}{137086}Go easy there laddie, go easy.
{137091}{137128}Let's have a drink.
{137230}{137316}Calvero, old boy,|how's the world treating you?
{137321}{137385}Rather aggressively at the moment.
{137390}{137427}You don't know me.
{137433}{137493}The fact is most gratifying.
{137498}{137542}Is that supposed to be funny?
{137567}{137655}My man, you will never know.|Have a little drink.
{137660}{137713}Only have it|at the other end of the bar.
{137879}{137967}Pardon me, Miss Thereza is waiting|for you in the dress circle.
{138015}{138037}What is it?
{138042}{138106}Miss Thereza is waiting for you|in the dress circle.
{138127}{138245}Will you kindly tell her not to worry,|I've gone home to bed.
{138265}{138294}Very well, sir.
{138344}{138382}What's happened to Calvero?
{138387}{138465}He left word that he was tired|and had gone home to rest.
{138471}{138574}I must go at once. Say good night|to Mr. Postant for me.
{138632}{138664}I'll get you a cab.
{139539}{139579}I'll walk home.
{139757}{139855}He must be asleep, poor dear.|Too much excitement for him.
{139866}{139920}I'm beginning|to feel the strain myself.
{139925}{139953}Then I'll be going.
{139958}{140001}Shall we see you|before you leave for camp?
{140012}{140049}I leave this morning.
{140105}{140137}Good bye, Terry.
{140255}{140288}No, don't!
{140298}{140333}Say you love me, just a little.
{140338}{140364}Please!
{140370}{140405}I've tried to fight it, but I can't.
{140410}{140472}Please, it's useless.
{140477}{140564}You're as helpless as I am.|We love each other.
{140579}{140622}I never said I loved you.
{140627}{140677}Every look, gesture says it!
{140689}{140721}No, don't say that!
{140726}{140769}I know how devoted|you are to Calvero,
{140778}{140835}but marrying him isn't right.|It isn't fair to you.
{140851}{140892}You're young, just beginning life.
{140897}{140972}This devotion is idealistic.|Your youth!
{140989}{141031}But it isn't love.
{141122}{141221}No, you're wrong.|I really love him.
{141274}{141309}You pity him.
{141384}{141427}It's more than pity.
{141449}{141531}It's something I've lived with,|grown to.
{141575}{141686}It's his soul, his sweetness,|his sadness...
{141711}{141777}Nothing will ever separate me|from that.
{141943}{141977}Good night, Terry.
{142029}{142061}Good bye.
{142509}{142542}Listen to this one:
{142552}{142637}''With ease, Thereza pirouetted|and flexed radiant authority.
{142642}{142698}''She was light,|quicksilver, efflorescing!
{142703}{142771}''A Diana spinning|wisps of beauty about her.''
{142830}{142862}Very good.
{142897}{142961}Well, you've done it.
{142984}{143034}How's it feel to wake up famous?
{143102}{143224}That's right, have a good cry|and enjoy it. It only happens once.
{143348}{143390}Let's marry, soon.
{143400}{143480}If we could only get away.|That house in the country,
{143485}{143547}where we could have|peace and happiness.
{143552}{143588}Happiness.
{143593}{143668}The first time I've ever heard you|mention that word.
{143680}{143752}- I'm always happy with you.|- Are you?
{143765}{143830}Of course. I love you.
{143835}{143890}Wasted on an old man.
{143895}{143928}Love is never wasted.
{143946}{144049}Terry, you're like a nun, shutting|everything else out for my sake.
{144065}{144117}It isn't fair, wasting your youth.
{144124}{144165}You deserve more than this.
{144205}{144231}Let me go away.
{144254}{144291}What's come over you?
{144312}{144389}I can't help it!|If I only had the strength to leave!
{144394}{144448}But I stay on, tormenting myself.
{144453}{144492}The whole thing is false.
{144497}{144588}In the few years I have left,|I must have truth.
{144637}{144682}That's all I have left.
{144714}{144746}Truth.
{144781}{144825}That's all I want.
{144841}{144895}And if possible, a little dignity.
{144905}{144962}If you leave me, I'll kill myself.
{144974}{145052}I hate life!|The torment, the cruelty of it.
{145061}{145149}I couldn't go on without you!|Don't you understand, I love you!
{145193}{145258}- You want to love me.|- But I do, I do!
{145263}{145325}It's Neville you love.|I don't blame you.
{145359}{145392}That isn't true.
{145397}{145458}He's the composer|you knew at Sardou's.
{145470}{145545}Yes. I didn't tell you|because I thought it...
{145550}{145630}Inevitable.|I prophesized it, remember?
{145655}{145697}A balcony overlooking the Thames!
{145702}{145738}But it isn't true!
{145743}{145814}In the twilight|he will tell you he loves you.
{145819}{145881}And you will tell him|you've always loved him.
{145886}{145963}But I don't love him! I never did.
{145969}{146010}It was his music, his art.
{146015}{146060}He meant a world|that had been denied me.
{146065}{146097}You look so well together.
{146102}{146183}But I don't love him! I never did.
{146205}{146288}Please, you must believe me!|You must!
{146348}{146441}Dancing's excellent,|but the comedy's poor.
{146452}{146501}We'll have to get rid of that clown.
{146640}{146756}I've called Blackmore's Agency,|they're sending down another man.
{146767}{146800}You know who that clown is?
{146805}{146874}I don't care if it's Calvero himself.|He isn't funny.
{146879}{146924}- But that's who it is.|- What?
{146929}{146982}Calvero,|only he's under another name.
{146987}{147046}Why the devil didn't you tell me?
{147051}{147092}He didn't want it known.
{147097}{147200}Poor old Calvero. Well, that's|different, we'd better keep him.
{147225}{147290}After all,|the comedy isn't too important.
{147327}{147444}But I didn't see him|at the supper party on opening night.
{147449}{147517}He didn't show up.|That's why Thereza left so early.
{147522}{147549}What's he got to do with her?
{147554}{147600}Believe it or not,|she's going to marry him.
{147608}{147645}That old reprobate?
{147650}{147716}Bless my soul,|there's hope for me yet.
{147721}{147773}It's time for rehearsal.
{147783}{147812}Wait a minute.
{147817}{147912}I'll call Blackmore's and cancel|that fellow before he gets down here.
{147966}{148015}If you finish rehearsing early,|don't wait for me.
{148020}{148100}I've so many things to do,|but I'll be home by six.
{148182}{148245}- Calvero?|- Griffin!
{148251}{148324}I haven't seen you in ages!|Where are you working?
{148329}{148371}Nowhere. I'm looking for a job.
{148376}{148439}Blackmore sent me down|to see this new ballet.
{148444}{148469}The Harlequinade?
{148474}{148535}I understand the clown's|not very good
{148540}{148611}and I could get the part.|Wish me luck.
{148645}{148682}- Good luck, old man.|- Thanks.
{149903}{149947}Mrs. Alsop!
{150087}{150118}What is it?
{150176}{150217}What on earth is the matter?
{150222}{150269}Calvero, where is he?|Have you seen him?
{150274}{150330}- What do you mean?|- He's left me!
{150359}{150399}He's gone!
{151926}{151964}Would you like to contribute?
{152309}{152364}Captain,|would you like to contribute?
{152626}{152686}No, that's all right, put it in.
{152691}{152733}I've no false pride.
{152809}{152851}Sit down, have a drink.
{152856}{152943}Thank you, old man, not during|office hours. But I'll sit down.
{153028}{153052}May I?
{153225}{153257}How are you?
{153262}{153299}Never felt better in my life!
{153304}{153356}And how is the army treating you?
{153363}{153401}Not so bad.
{153410}{153466}I get up to London every other week.
{153531}{153569}Have you seen Terry?
{153656}{153679}How is she?
{153700}{153739}After you left she was quite ill.
{153744}{153780}But she's all right now?
{153799}{153889}She's been touring the continent.|Since she got back she's much better.
{153944}{153967}Good.
{153994}{154034}She never told me|what happened between you.
{154087}{154137}What could happen,|but the inevitable?
{154195}{154235}You see a great deal of her?
{154390}{154423}Good.
{154430}{154486}Somehow I knew|it would work out that way.
{154510}{154562}Time is the great author.
{154567}{154611}It always writes|the perfect ending.
{154732}{154764}Great Scott!
{154769}{154808}How do you do, Mr. Postant?
{154839}{154913}Just a moment.|You're just the man I want to see.
{154928}{154971}Would you like to contribute?
{154976}{155017}Are you with that outfit outside?
{155022}{155053}I am, sir.
{155083}{155112}Oh, thank you.
{155117}{155164}You oughtn't to be doing this!
{155169}{155256}Why not? All the world's a stage.
{155277}{155332}And this one is the most legitimate.
{155337}{155446}I must go, or my confreres will|think I've run off with the takings.
{155504}{155539}Thank you, gentlemen.
{155560}{155622}Don't you think|I should tell Terry I've seen you?
{155627}{155713}Knowing I'm doing this sort of thing|might upset her.
{155718}{155752}Although I don't mind it.
{155757}{155820}There's something|about working the streets I like.
{155825}{155874}It's the tramp in me, I suppose.
{155879}{155956}Wait a minute. Why don't you|come and see me at my office?
{155961}{155989}- What about?|- Business.
{155995}{156082}I never discuss business,|I leave that to my agent. Call him up.
{156090}{156154}However I'm booked up solid,|you know.
{156164}{156200}Au revoir, Gentlemen.
{156492}{156563}Driver, stop!|Please, turn around.
{156804}{156840}Keep the change.
{157045}{157122}Cyrano de Bergerac,|without the nose.
{157172}{157203}Let's sit down.
{157560}{157601}So they told you, huh?
{157639}{157699}I've been searching|all over London for you.
{157741}{157783}The same Terry.
{157821}{157856}Am I?
{157904}{157951}A little more grown up, that's all.
{157978}{158025}I don't want to grow up.
{158069}{158107}None of us do.
{158126}{158176}But I had to, after you left.
{158289}{158384}It's all for the best.|All for the best.
{158417}{158449}Perhaps.
{158490}{158527}I don't know.
{158578}{158622}But something's gone.
{158659}{158699}Gone forever.
{158735}{158773}Nothing's gone,
{158791}{158830}it only changes.
{158868}{158902}I still love you.
{158916}{158953}Of course you do.
{158979}{159015}You always will.
{159068}{159114}Calvero, come back.
{159145}{159193}You've got to come back!
{159215}{159307}I can't.|I must go forward.
{159338}{159370}That's progress.
{159380}{159428}Then let me go with you.
{159460}{159531}I'll do everything in the world|to make you happy.
{159578}{159660}That's what hurts.|I know you will.
{159743}{159811}Mr. Postant said|he'd give you a benefit.
{159829}{159873}I don't want his charity.
{159896}{159943}It isn't charity.
{159948}{160030}He says it'd be the greatest|event in theatrical history.
{160042}{160098}I'm not interested in events.
{160125}{160199}But I would like a chance just|to show them I'm not through yet.
{160204}{160236}Of course.
{160267}{160317}I've still got ideas, you know.
{160332}{160442}I've been working on,|working on... a comedy act,
{160447}{160491}for myself and my friend.
{160501}{160542}It's sort of a musical satire.
{160547}{160572}Wonderful!
{160577}{160678}You know he's a very good pianist,|and me with the violin...
{160701}{160768}A lot of very really|really very funny business.
{161060}{161085}Come in.
{161202}{161258}Sit down, my dear.|You look tired.
{161277}{161359}I've been working with the claque,|going over Calvero's jokes.
{161374}{161434}I gave them cue sheets so|they'll know exactly where to laugh.
{161439}{161488}Are the jokes as bad as all that?
{161504}{161612}I'm worried. If he fails tonight,|it'll kill him. I know it.
{161617}{161706}He won't fail. The audience|will be most sympathetic.
{161711}{161778}But he doesn't want sympathy.|He keeps saying that.
{161789}{161843}He wants to be a genuine success.
{161848}{161960}What does he expect?|You know he's not the man he was.
{161973}{162009}He mustn't be told that!
{162035}{162081}Tell me, my dear,
{162091}{162182}are you still going to marry him?
{162225}{162278}I'll do anything in the world|to make him happy.
{162287}{162330}He's a very lucky man.
{162359}{162428}He's a very, very lucky man.
{162473}{162525}I never thought we'd come to this.
{162539}{162614}Here we have the star dressing room|without a dresser.
{162640}{162712}Oh well, I guess we can put up|with it for one night.
{162719}{162752}Fred, the stage manager.
{162757}{162784}Come in, Fred.
{162823}{162891}Like old times,|seeing you in this room again.
{162902}{162937}What's on your mind?
{162942}{163035}You've got 10 minutes, because|there's 20 other acts to follow.
{163054}{163129}You're in a song first,|finishing up with a musical act.
{163136}{163183}I'll ring down|after you fall in the drum.
{163188}{163235}No, after I'm carried off|in the drum.
{163240}{163283}Right you are. Thank you, sir.
{163348}{163452}If anybody else says it's like old|times, I'll jump out the window!
{163459}{163540}First the doorman,|then the call boy,
{163552}{163591}now the stage manager.
{163598}{163629}It's me, Postant.
{163640}{163744}It's like old times seeing you here|again putting on your war paint.
{163767}{163826}I'll be down|watching the other acts.
{163844}{163962}Yes, like old times.|Only in those days you were drunk.
{163969}{164007}I'm supposed to be funnier|when I'm drunk.
{164012}{164058}Maybe, but you were killing yourself.
{164063}{164137}You know, anything for a laugh.|How's the house?
{164142}{164211}Packed. Every face card in Europe|is out there:
{164216}{164271}kings, queens, jacks...
{164276}{164344}- Is Neville out there?|- Yes. Came up specially.
{164354}{164400}And what a program!
{164405}{164498}Take a look at that. Every star|in the business is appearing.
{164509}{164558}It'll be something,|following all this talent.
{164563}{164658}Don't worry. Tonight you'll|make them look like amateurs.
{164663}{164714}That's all any of us are. Amateurs.
{164719}{164783}We don't live long enough|to be anything else.
{164822}{164899}Well, as one old amateur|to another...
{164920}{164980}- Good luck.|- Thank you, Mr. Postant.
{165665}{165691}Come in.
{165803}{165839}How do I look?
{165859}{165889}Funny.
{165896}{165968}I know what you're thinking,|my health and all that.
{165983}{166029}But I had to take a drink.
{166041}{166123}There's a creamy white light|turning off and on in my stomach.
{166128}{166208}And that's not so good,|if I'm to be a success tonight.
{166213}{166248}Is it really worth it?
{166253}{166323}Not that I care for success,|but I don't want another failure.
{166328}{166414}Whatever happens, there's always|that little home in the country.
{166431}{166484}This is my home. Here.
{166496}{166537}I thought you hated the theatre.
{166542}{166656}I do. I also hate the sight of blood|but it's in my veins.
{166690}{166715}Come in.
{166747}{166794}Mr. Calvero, on stage please!
{166803}{166870}Good luck, sir.|They're all waiting for you.
{166894}{166920}Thanks.
{167023}{167062}I don't like it.
{167081}{167144}Everyone's so kind to me.
{167149}{167193}Makes me feel isolated.
{167281}{167338}Even you make me feel isolated.
{167352}{167396}Why do you say that?
{167435}{167472}I don't know.
{167499}{167544}I really don't know.
{167620}{167689}- Oh, your change.|- No, no.
{167694}{167726}Of course!
{167809}{167862}All right, turn it off up there!
{167973}{168016}Your change is all ready.
{168049}{168093}Good luck, my darling.
{168124}{168188}- Aren't you going to watch?|- I can't.
{168194}{168227}But remember I love you.
{168246}{168273}Really?
{168278}{168349}Always. With all my heart.
{168354}{168384}Ready, Mr. Calvero?
{168389}{168428}Good luck, my darling.
{168458}{168491}Let her go!

{172938}{172963}I've another act to do.
{172969}{173017}Bow and finish!
{173487}{173508}What am I to do?
{173513}{173580}Just finish.|There are 15 other acts to follow.
{173761}{173827}Look, I've got Postant|on the telephone!
{173874}{173935}Please, please.|Will you give me a chance?
{173942}{173995}What's wrong?|Why isn't he doing an encore?
{174003}{174062}I can't keep the other acts waiting.|They're complaining.
{174068}{174132}That's your problem.|He does an encore.
{174371}{174407}Do your encore!
{183737}{183783}Mmm, you darling!
{186022}{186060}- Here, take this.|- What is it?
{186065}{186135}I have a terrific pain|in my back and chest.
{186140}{186191}Dr. Blake is in the house.|Shall I get him?
{186196}{186229}Yes, get him at once!
{186234}{186282}- What's wrong?|- He's hurt his spine.
{186287}{186331}- Did you send for the doctor?|- Yes.
{186349}{186387}Then carry him|to his dressing room.
{186392}{186452}I'll tell the audience|there's been an accident.
{186457}{186504}No, don't do that!|Carry me on.
{186509}{186571}I'll talk to them.|You'll ruin the evening.
{186983}{187106}On behalf of my partner,|and myself...
{187161}{187215}This is a wonderful evening.
{187224}{187302}I'd like to continue,|but I'm stuck.
{187729}{187765}Take off his makeup.
{187772}{187804}Is there a couch|in his dressing room?
{187809}{187846}No, but there's one|in the prop room.
{187851}{187878}Take him in there.
{187883}{187935}Everyone else must wait outside.
{188133}{188239}Where's Calvero?|Where is the old scoundrel?
{188256}{188325}I want to congratulate him.|Where's Calvero?
{188330}{188389}In the prop room.|He's had an accident.
{188418}{188454}Here's the doctor now.
{188462}{188501}I want an ambulance at once.
{188506}{188532}Is it serious, Doctor?
{188537}{188587}Very. It isn't his back,|it's a heart attack.
{188593}{188643}- Is he in pain?|- Not now. I've given him something.
{188648}{188680}I'm afraid he won't last the night.
{189023}{189061}What have they been telling you?
{189066}{189108}Are you all right?
{189124}{189159}Of course.
{189190}{189229}I'm an old weed.
{189256}{189329}The more I'm cut down,|the more I spring up again.
{189391}{189420}Did you hear them?
{189500}{189544}I don't mean the claque.
{189549}{189575}Wonderful!
{189597}{189644}That's how it used to be.
{189685}{189749}That's how it's going to be|from now on.
{189832}{189880}We're going to tour the world.
{189938}{189978}I've got ideas.
{190002}{190097}You doing ballet, and me comedy.
{190224}{190310}And in the elegant melancholy|of twilight,
{190359}{190399}he will tell you he loves you.
{190418}{190504}It doesn't matter.|It's you I love.
{190524}{190621}The heart and the mind...|what an enigma.
{190656}{190726}Miss Thereza, you're on, please.
{190840}{190890}I won't be long, my darling.
{191205}{191253}I believe I'm dying, Doctor.
{191291}{191399}But then, I don't know.|I've died so many times.
{191408}{191448}Are you in pain?
{191475}{191506}No more.
{191600}{191634}Where is she?
{191673}{191715}I want to see her dance.
{191752}{191784}Wait a minute.
{192130}{192179}Bring the couch into the wings.
{192206}{192247}I must see about that ambulance.
Thanks.
That's your excuse for going on a kill-crazy rampage?
I don't like alarms,
Mr. White.
What does it matter who stays with the cop?
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.
Shut the fuck up, man!
You guys should never have taken him outta the trunk... in the first place.
We tried to find out about the setup.
There is no fuckin' setup!
Now here's the news!
Blondie, you stay here, take care of these two!
White and Pink... you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here... and he sees all these cars parked outside...
I swear to you he's gonna be... just as mad at me as he is at you.
Fine. Let's go.
Alone at last.
Guess what.
I think I'm parked in the red zone.
Now, where were we?
I told you,
I don't know anything... about any fuckin' setup.
I've been on the force for only eight months.
They don't tell me anything.
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me... all you want.
Torture you?
That's a good.
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.
Even your boss said there wasn't a setup.
- My what?
- Your boss.
Excuse me, pal.
One thing
I wanna make clear to you.
I don't have a boss.
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?
You hear what I said, you son of a bitch?
All right, all right, you don't have a boss.
Get that fuckin' shit off.
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you, okay?
I don't really give a good fuck... what you know or don't know... but I'm gonna torture you anyway... regardless.
Not to get information.
It's amusing to me to torture a cop.
You can say anything you want...
'cause
I've heard it all before.
All you can do is... pray for a quick death... which... you ain't gonna get.
Oh, God.
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?
It's my personal favorite.
Joe Egan
and Gerry Rafferty...
were a duo known as
Stealer's Wheel...
when they recorded
this Dylanesque, pop...
bubble-gum favorite
from April of 1974.
That reached up
to number five...
as K-BILL Y's "Super Sounds
of the '70s"continues.
Hold still.
Hold still, you fuck.
Was that good for you too?
Hey, what's goin' on?
You hear that?
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Don't! Stop! Stop!
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.
That burn a little bit?
Don't! Stop!
Please stop.
Just stop. Stop.
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.
Don't burn me, please.
I don't know anything about... any of you fucking guys.
I'm not gonna say anything.
No! Please, no.
- You all through?
- Stop!
You all through?
Please.
I got a little kid at home.
You all done?
- Don't!
- Have some fire.
Oh, shit.
Hey, you.
What's your name?
Marvin.
Marvin what?
Marvin Nash.
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a...
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.
Yeah, I know.
You do?
Yeah. Your name's
Freddy somethin'.
Newendyke.
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti... introduced us about five months ago.
I don't remember that at all.
I do.
Freddy.
How do I look?
What?
I don't know what to tell you, Marvin.
That fuck.
That sick fuck!
That fuckin' bastard!
Marvin,
I need you to hold on.
There's cops waiting to move a block away.
What the fuck are they waiting for?
This fuckin' guy, he slashes my face... and cuts my fuckin' ear off!
I'm fuckin' deformed!
Fuck you!
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!
I'm fuckin' dyin'!
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.
I was sent in to get him.
All right?
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.
We'rejust gonna sit here and bleed...
'til Joe Cabot sticks... his fuckin' head through that door.
Say hello to a mother-fucker who's inside.
Cabot's doing ajob.
He wants me on the team.
This better not be ajoke.
This ain't ajoke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.
He says I should just wait for a phone call.
After waiting three days he calls me last night... and says Joe's ready.
He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
Who picked you up?
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.
We get there... and I meet Joe and a guy named Mr. White.
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.
Okay, Mr. Orange.
- You ever see him before?
- Who? Mr. White?
Yes. Mr. White.
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?
Mr. White.
- A little.
- About what?
The Brewers.
Milwaukee Brewers?
They won the night before. He made some money off them.
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan... he's gotta be from Wisconsin.
And I'll bet they got a sheet in Milwaukee... on this Mr. White's ass.
So I want you to go... through everybody in Milwaukee... with a history of armed robbery... and put a name to the face.
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.
How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
Perfect.
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.
Nice Guy checked it out and said it was A-okay.
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle... and that I was ready to move.
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.
Long Beach Mike is not your friend.
Long Beach Mike is a fucking scumbag.
He's selling out his friends.
That's how nice he fuckin' is.
I'll take care of his ass... but you get that scumbag out of mind... and take care of business.
Gone.
Use the commode story?
What's the commode story
It's a scene.
Memorize it.
A what?
Undercover cops gotta be Brando.
To do thisjob you gotta be... a great actor, naturalistic.
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.
If you're a bad actor, that's bullshit in thisjob.
What is this?
That's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Something funny that happened to you... while you were doing ajob.
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.
Think about it like it's ajoke.
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.
You can tell ajoke, can't you?
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles... and tell ajoke, all right?
The things you gotta remember are the details.
The details sell your story.
This particular story takes place... in a men's room.
You gotta know all the details.
Whether they got paper towels... or a blower to dry your hands.
You gotta know... if the stalls ain't got no doors or not.
You gotta know if they got liquid soap... or that pink, granulated shit... they used in high school.
You gotta know if they got hot water or not.
If it stinks... if some nasty, lowlife, scum-ridden mother-fucker... sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls.
You gotta know every detail there is... to know about this commode.
What you gotta do is take all them details... and make 'em your own.
While you're doing that... remember that this story is about you... and how you perceived the events that went down.
The only way to do that... is keep sayin' it... and sayin' it and sayin' it.
This is during... the L.A. Marijuana drought, 1986.
I still had a connection, which was insane 'cause... you couldn't get any weed anywhere then.
Anyway...
I had a connection with this hippie chick... in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it.
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy"...
And say, "Hey, dude.
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"
They knew I still smoked... so they asked me to buy some for them.
It got to be...
Every time
I bought some weed...
I was buyin' for four or five people.
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.
She didn't even have to meet these people.
I was doing all the work.
That got to be a pain in the ass... people calling all the time.
I couldn't even rent a tape without interruptions.
"When's the next time you're gettin' some?"
"Mother-fucker, I'm tryin' to watch The Lost Boys.
When I get some,
I'll call you".
Then these rink-a-dink potheads come by.
They're my friends and everything, but still.
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags... they don't want
60 dollars worth.
They want ten dollars' worth... and breaking it up wasn't easy.
I don't even know... what ten dollars' worth looks like.
This was a very weird situation.
Remember back in '86... there was a major fuckin' drought.
Nobody had anything.
People were livin' on resin... smokin' the wood in their pipes.
This chick had a bunch... and she's beggin' me to sell it.
So I told her...
I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore... but I would take a little bit... and sell it to my close friends.
She agreed, we kept the same arrangement as before.
Ten percent and free pot for me... if I helped her that weekend.
She was sellin' a brick of weed and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.
Her brother usually goes with her... but he's in County unexpectedly.
What for?
His traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him, found warrants on him... took him to County.
She doesn't wanna walk around alone... with all that weed.
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.
She keeps asking me, finally I said okay...
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.
So we go to the train station.
Wait. You're goin' to the station with the weed?
The guy needed it right away.
Anyway, we get to the train station... and we're waitin' for the guy.
I'm carryin' the weed in a carry-on bag.
I gotta take a piss... so I tell her I'm goin' to the boy's room.
So I walk
into the men's room...
and who's standing there?
Four L.A. County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they'rejust talkin'.
When I walked in, they all stopped talkin'... and they looked at me.
That's hard. That's a fuckin' hard situation.
German shepherd starts barking.
He's barkin' at me.
I mean, it's obvious he's barkin' at me.
Every nerve ending, all of my senses... the blood in the veins was screamin':
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there".
Panic hits me like a bucket of water.
Bam! Right in the face.
I'm drenched in panic and these cops... are lookin' at me and they know it.
They can smell it... sure as that fuckin' dog can.
They can smell it on me.
Shut up.
So anyway...
I got my gun drawn.
I point it at this guy and I tell him...
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move".
This little idiot's looking right at me... and saying "I know I know."
But meanwhile... his right hand is creepin' toward the glove box.
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!
Put your hands on the dash".
He's still looking at me, nodding his head.
"I know, buddy, I know".
Meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box.
And I said...
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you in the face... if you don't put your hands on the dash".
Then this guy's girlfriend... this real sexy Oriental bitch... she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"
So then the guy snaps out of it... and puts his hands on the dash.
What was he goin' for?
His fucking registration.
- You're kidding.
- No, man!
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close... he came to gettin' blown away.
That close, man.
You knew how to handle that situation.
You shit your pants, dive in and swim.
Tell me more about Cabot.
I don't know.
He's a cool guy.
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.
You remember the Fantastic Four?
Yeah, with that invisible bitch... and "Flame on" and shit, right?
Thing.
Mother-fucker...
Looksjust like the Thing.
Hey! Showtime!
Grab yourjacket.
I'm parked outside.
I'll be right down.
He'll be right down.
Don't pussy out on me now.
They don't know.
They don't know shit.
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.
They believe every fuckin' word...
'cause you're super cool.
There goes our boy.
The guy has to have rocks... in his head the size of Gibraltar... to work undercover.
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.
I know what
I'm talking about.
Black women ain't the same as white women.
There's a slight difference.
Very funny.
You know what I mean.
What a white bitch will put up with... a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.
If you cross their line, they fuck you up.
I gotta go along with Pink on that.
Okay, Mr. Expert, if this is such a truism... why is it that every nigger I know... treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll bet those same niggers... who show their ass in public... when their bitches get 'em home... they chill the fuck out.
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.
Tell you guys a story.
In one of Daddy's clubs... there's a black cocktail waitress named Elois.
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.
E-Lois.
We called her Lady E.
Where was she from?
Compton?
She's from Ladora Heights.
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.
It's not the black Beverly Hills.
It's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway...
Lady E... she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.
Every guy who ever saw her... had tojack off to her at least once.
You know who she looked like?
She looked like Christie Love.
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love... about the black female cop?
She always used to say...
"You're under arrest, sugar!"
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.
Pam Grier did the film.
Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show... without Pam Grier.
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?
Great. Now I'm totally fuckin' tortured.
Whoever it was... she looked exactly like Elois.
Anne Francis.
No. That was Honey West.
Anne Francis is white.
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.
We come into the club one night... and there's Carlos, the bartender.
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.
I says to him: "Carlos, where's Lady E tonight"?
Apparently Lady E... was married to real piece of dog shit... a real animal.
He used to do things to her.
Like what?
What would he do?
Beat her up?
I don't know.
Hejust did things.
So anyway... one night she plays it real cool.
She waits for him to get drunk.
He falls asleep on the fuckin' couch.
She sneaks up on him...
She puts some glue on his dick... and glues his dick to his belly.
Jesus Christ!
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.
They had to call the paramedics... to cut the prick loose.
Was he all pissed off?
How would you feel if you had to do... a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?
You guys like to tell jokes... and giggle and kid around, huh?
Giggling like a bunch of girls... in the schoolyard.
Well, let me tell ajoke.
Five guys sittin' in a bullpen...
San Quentin... wonderin' how the fuck they got there.
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?
It's your fault, his fault"...
All that bullshit.
Finally somebody says...
"Wait a minute.
While we were planning this caper... wejust sat around tellin' fuckin' jokes".
Got the message?
I don't mean to holler at ya.
When this caper's over, and I'm sure it'll be successful... we'll go down to Hawaiian Islands...
I'll laugh with all of you.
Find me a different character down there.
Right now it's a matter of business.
With the exception of Eddie and myself... who you already know... we're gonna be using aliases on thisjob.
Under no circumstances... do we want any one of you to relate to each other... by your Christian names.
And I don't want any talk about yourself personally.
That includes where you been... your wife's name... where you might've done time... or a bank maybe you robbed in St. Petersburg.
All I want you guys to talk about... if you have to... is what you're gonna do.
That should do it.
These are your names...
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot!
Why can't we pick our own colors?
No way. No way.
Tried it once.
It doesn't work.
You get four guys... all fightin' over who gets to be Mr. Black.
They don't know each other... so nobody wants to back down.
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.
Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
But Mr. Brown, that's too close to Mr. Shit.
Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.
How about Mr. Purple?
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.
You're not Mr. Purple.
Some guy on some otherjob is Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink!
Who care what your name is?
Easy for you to say.
You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink... you wanna trade?
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'... city council meeting, you know.
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.
There's two ways you can go on thisjob... my way or the highway.
What's it gonna be,
Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink.
Let's move on.
I'll move on when I feel like it.
Do all you guys got the goddamn message?
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin' at you guys...
I can hardly talk.
Let's go to work.
Let's go over it.
Where are you?
I stand outside
and guard the door.
I don't let anybody
go in or out.
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.
I give him the signal, he pulls up in front.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.
Crowd control.
They handle the customers and the employees.
That girl's ass.
Sittin' right here on my dick.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
You two take the manager... and make him give you the diamonds.
We're there for those stones, period.
Since no display cases are being fucked with... no alarms should go off.
We're out in two minutes, not one second longer.
What if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
A store like this is insured up the ass.
They're not supposed to give you... any resistance whatsoever.
If you get a customer or an employee... who thinks he's Charles Bronson... smash their nose with your gun.
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyonejumps.
He falls down screaming... blood squirts out of his nose.
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.
Some bitch might talk shit to you.
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.
If it's the manager, that's different.
The managers know not to fuck around... so if he's giving you static... he probably thinks he's a real cowboy... so you gotta that bastard in two.
If he won't tell ya something... cut off one of his fingers.
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.
After that, he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear.
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.
Fuck.
Jesus.
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.
No, you just got blood in your eyes.
Is he dead?
Did he die or not?
Let's go.
Hold it! Get out!
Get out of the fuckin' car!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.
I can't believe she killed me.
Who'd have fucking thought that?
Hey... just cancel that shit right now.
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.
But you ain't dying.
All this blood's scaring the shit out of me, Larry.
I'm gonna die.
I know it.
What the fuck happened?
He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear... and was gonna burn him alive.
What? I didn't hear you.
I said...
Blonde went crazy.
He slashed the cop's face... cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
This cop?
He went crazy?
Something like that?
Worse or better?
Eddie, he was pulling a burn, man.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
When you guys walked in... he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds.
What'd I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit... was a stone-cold psycho.
You should've asked the cop... notjust killed him.
He talked about what he was gonna do... when he was slicing him up.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me.
You didn't see how he acted during thejob. We did.
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.
Let mejust say this out loud...
'cause I wanna get this straight.
You're saying that Mr. Blonde... was gonna kill you... and then when we got back... he was gonna kill us... take the diamonds and scram.
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?
I swear on my mother's soul... that's what happened.
The man you killed... just got released from prison.
He got caught at a company warehouse... full of hot items.
He could've fuckin' walked.
All he had to do was say my dad's name...
"but he didn't;" he kept his mouth shut.
He did his fuckin' time like a man.
He did four years for us.
So, Mr. Orange.
You're telling me... that this good friend of mine... who did four years for my father... who, in four years, never made a deal... no matter what they offered him... you're telling me that now that he's free... and we're making good on our commitment to him... he'sjust gonna decide... out of the fucking blue... to rip us off?
Why don't you tell me what really happened.
What the hell for?
It'd just be more bullshit.
This man set us up.
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't know what's happening.
It's all right. I do.
What are you talking about?
That lump of shit's workin' with the L.A.P.D.
I don't have the slightest fucking idea... what you're talking about.
Joe...
I don't know what you think you know...
- but you're wrong.
- Like hell I am.
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.
He's a good kid.
I understand you're super-pissed.
We're all real emotional.
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him.
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know jack shit!
I do.
The cocksucker tipped off the cops... and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.
How do you know all this?
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.
I should have my head examined... going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.
That's your proof?
With instinct, you don't need proof.
I ignored it before, but no more.
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?
I'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake.
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.
We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals.
Larry, look... it's been quite a long time.
A lot ofjobs.
There's no need for this, man.
Let'sjust... put our guns down... and let's settle this... with a fucking conversation.
Joe... if you kill that man, you die next.
Repeat: You kill him, you die next.
Larry, we have been friends.
You respect my dad and I respect you... but I'll put bullets in you.
You put that fuckin' gun down now.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this.
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun at my dad!
I'm sorry, kid.
Looks like we're gonna... do a little time.
I'm a cop.
Larry...
I'm sorry.
I'm... so sorry.
I'm a cop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Freeze!
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!
- Now!
- Put the gun down!
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.moviesubtitles.org</font>
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!
They've killed your son Paolo!
Murderers! Murderers!
My son...
All my respect, Don Ciccio.
You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo...
...because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.
Don't worry. This little boy can't do a thing to you.
When he's a man, he'll come for revenge.
I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son.
He's all I have left.
I swear to God he'll never do you any harm. Spare him!
Vito, run!
Move and I'll kill him!
Run, Vito!
Kill him!
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!
You understand?
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!
Vito, we're praying for you!
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...
...turn him over to us.
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!
It'll be better for the boy, and better for you!
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!
Nurse.
Money?
Interpreter!
Where are you from?
-What is your name?
-Maria.
What is your name?
Come on, son. What is your name?
Vito Andolini from Corleone.
Corleone. Vito Corleone.
Okay, over there.
Next.
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.
Vito Corleone!
Here he is. This is him.
Did you bring the car keys?
Laurie! Laurie!
Mama!
-Look who's here.
-Father Carmelo.
-This is Father Carmelo.
-I'm Merle Johnson.
Mama!
-Here I am.
-Constanzia, after one week?
I sent the car to the airport last week to pick you up.
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just one week late. This is for my mama!
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?
Hello. How are you? Thank you.
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him and I can't wait on line.
You go see your children first.
Then you worry about waiting on line to see your brother. Like everybody else.
Ladies and gentlemen...
A most distinguished guest would like to say a few words.
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary of the State of Nevada.
And there is Mrs. Geary.
Thank you very much.
This is a very, very happy day for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.
We see Nevada far too seldom.
But today we can join with old friends, we can make new friends and we help celebrate a young man's first Communion.
And also to thank that boy's family for a magnificent contribution to the State.
I have here in my hand a check made out to the university and it is a magnificent endowment in the name of
Anthony Vito Corleone.
The check is signed by that young man's parents whom I think we should recognize.
Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!
Folks, I want you to join me in giving a real Nevada thank you to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!
We also have, as a special added attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir who have chosen a certain special song and a special arrangement to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.
Boys.
The plaque.
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?
Okay, that's good.
Now, Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.
He arranged everything through your man Turnbull.
-Yes, yes.
-Sit down.
I thought that you and
I would talk alone.
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.
Well, it's perfectly all right with me but I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you.
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my position has ever talked to you before.
The Corleone family has done well in Nevada.
You own, or control, two major hotels in Vegas and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in so there was no problem with the Gaming Commission.
Now my sources tell me that you plan to make a move against the Tropigala.
They tell me that within a week, you're going to move Klingman out.
Quite an expansion. However, it will leave you with a little technical problem.
The license will still be in Klingman's name.
-Turnbull is a good man.
-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.
I don't want to spend more time here than I have to.
You can have the license.
The price is 250,000 dollars.
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.
The price for the license is less than 20,000 dollars, right?
That's right.
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.
I don't like your kind of people.
I don't like to see you come out to this clean country in oily hair dressed up in those silk suits and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans.
I'll do business with you, but the fact is that I despise your masquerade, the dishonest way you pose yourself and your whole fucking family.
Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy.
But never think it applies to my family.
All right, all right.
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.
Let's say that you'll pay me because it's in your interest.
I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. One more thing.
Don't you contact me again, ever.
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.
Senator, you can have my answer now if you like.
My offer is this...
Nothing.
Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would like you to put up.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.
-Honey, we have to go.
-Really? I'm sorry.
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch, you look great!
Frank Pentangeli!
I thought you was never coming out west, you big bum!
I've got to check on my boys.
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker with chopped liver and says, "canapés”.
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"
Bring out the peppers and sardines!
Seeing you reminds me of New York in the old days!
You remember Willi Cicci, who was with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?
No, that was no heart attack.
That's what I'm here to see your brother Mike about.
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?
Do I have to get a letter of introduction to get a sit-down?
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.
Rocco.
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.
Johnny?
Tom won't stay. He only handles specific areas of the business.
Sure, Mike.
-What are you drinking, Johnny?
-Anisette.
-If you need anything, I'll be outside.
-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?
It's not good.
Can I do anything or send anything?
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
That casino...
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.
The real owners are the old Lakeville Road group and our friend in Miami.
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of it too, but I've been instructed to tell you that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along.
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.
Hyman Roth always makes money for his partners.
One by one, our old friends are gone.
Death, natural or not, prison, deported...
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he always made money for his partners.
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional musicians there isn't one Italian!
Let's have a tarantella!
You! Up, up, up!
Questa mano!
What the hell have we here?
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too. May I stay?
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?
Al, please get him a drink!
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book passage on The Queen.
Why don't you go to a travel agent?
We're getting married first.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet, and you're getting married?
You see your children on weekends.
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno for a theft you don't even know about.
You fly around the world with men who use you!
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?
I need money.
Connie, Connie, Connie...
I want to be reasonable with you.
Why don't you stay with the family?
You can live on the estate with your kids.
You won't be deprived of anything.
I don't know this Merle. I don't know what he does or what he lives on.
Tell him marriage is out of the question and you don't want to see him anymore.
He'll understand, believe me.
Connie.
If you don't listen to me and marry this man, you'll disappoint me.
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!
What's "Chen dannay"?
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily for 100 years. The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner!
I know, I know.
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're just jealous because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to.
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!
What are you doing to me, you big slob? Help!
Fredo!
-I can't control her, Mikey.
-You're my brother, don't apologize.
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.
I welched.
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.
-He hated them more than I do.
-Frankie, they feel cheated.
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains and you're drinking...
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.
Champagne cocktails, and passing judgment on how I run my family.
Your family's still called Corleone.
And you'll run it like a Corleone.
My family doesn't eat here, doesn't eat in Las Vegas...
...and doesn't eat in Miami...
...with Hyman Roth!
You're a good old man and I like you.
You were loyal to my father for years.
The Rosato brothers are taking hostages.
They spit right in my face, all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.
-Not touched?
-No, I want you to be fair with them.
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?
Tom, listen. They recruit spics, they recruit niggers.
They do violence in their grandmothers' neighborhoods!
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!
And they leave the gambling to last.
I want to run my family without you on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!
-No.
-Morte.
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood.
You know my father did business with Hyman Roth. He respected him.
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth, but he never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!
I want everybody here to know, there's not going to be no trouble from me!
Don Corleone.
Cicci, the door...
You want him to leave now?
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.
The old man had too much wine.
It's late.
How's the baby?
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, it does, Michael.
Kay?
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.
It couldn't be helped, though.
It made me think of what you once told me.
"In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate."
That was seven years ago.
I know. I'm trying, darling.
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
Kay, are you all right?
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop! Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
Yeah, come in.
-Mike, are you all right?
-Yeah.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
Well, he's got a good heart.
But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death.
Tom, you're my brother.
I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.
I give you complete power. Over Fredo and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.
I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family.
-If we catch them, will we find out...
-We won't catch them.
Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already.
They were killed by somebody close to us.
Inside. Very, very frightened that they botched it.
You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this?
See... All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think.
On that basis, anything is possible.
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here! There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired out of New York. I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
-Rocco.
Anthony, everything is going to be all right. Try to sleep.
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.
I know. Did you like them?
Yeah. I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Well, they were friends.
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.
I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.
-Will you take me?
-No, I can't, Anthony.
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.
I could help you.
I know. Some day you will.
Get some sleep.
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.
I left Naples. I left Mama.
For a no-good tramp!
Now here I am in America, in New York.
Alone! Thinking of my mother.
Without news from home.
Finally, a letter from Naples!
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
To you, she's beautiful. For me, there's only my wife and son.
Our dear mother -
...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
Sit down, you bum!
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter! Let her go!
Here, take all my money!
Vito, come on.
I know what you're thinking. But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
Even my father, in the grocery store.
If he's Italian...
...why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that. Did you like my angel?
If you're happy, I'm happy.
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
Hey, you speak Italian?
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
Abbandando, meet my nephew!
How's business?
It's good, it's good.
Fanucci's mad. Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount.
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure. He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
I'm a friend, right? So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
You've always been good to me, ever since I came here.
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
Oh, no!
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.
What a nice pear!
I'm Clemenza, you still have my goods?
Did you look inside?
I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would. But who has money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
Yeah, sure.
My wife would like it.
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.
Well, he won't mind.
Come on in.
Hey, Vito, come on in!
This is your friend's place?
This is a real palace.
One of the best.
Vito, give me a hand, will you?
Look how pretty it is, Santino!
Come on in.
It's all right. Hyman's in there.
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
-No, thank you.
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...
-Mr. Roth?
-Come in, Michael.
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.
It's almost over.
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.
I enjoy watching football in the afternoon.
One of the things I love about this country. Baseball too.
Ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919.
I heard you had some trouble.
Stupid.
People behaving like that with guns.
The important thing is you're all right.
Good health is the most important thing.
More than success, more than money.
More than power.
I came here because there's going to be more bloodshed.
I wanted you to know, so another war won't start.
Nobody wants another war.
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission to get rid of the Rosato brothers.
When I refused he tried to have me killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.
I'll visit him soon.
The important thing is that nothing interferes with our plans for the future.
Nothing is more important.
-You're a wise and considerate man.
-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.
-There's much I can learn from you.
-Whatever I can do to help, Michael.
-Excuse me. Lunch.
-Come in.
-Thank you, my dear.
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
You're young, I'm old and sick.
What we'll do in the next few months will make history.
It's never been done before.
Not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible.
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?
He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den. You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died. We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything. What can I do?
Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand. I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
Jesus Christ, Mike.
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid. We had to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
He taught me, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good.
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.
-Yeah?
-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?
-Who's that, honey?
-Listen good, Fredo.
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal.
-Oh, God.
-Will he come alone?
I don't know. You've got me in deep enough already.
Everything will be all right. Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal.
All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys.
You lied to me. I don't want you to call me anymore.
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
-Frankie, I've got nobody here.
-Wait in the car, Cicc'.
-Frankie.
-That's okay, Cicc'.
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie. Give us a taste.
We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie.
-You won't regret it.
-I don't like the C note, Rosato.
I take that as an insult.
Michael Corleone says hello!
Close the door!
Your friend the cop...
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?
I just came in to clean up a little, you know?
What's the matter?
-Is that something on the floor?
-Carmine, not here!
Anthony!
You open this bar and I'll blow your head in!
Freddy, it's good to see you.
-How is he?
-He's okay. He's in the back.
Girls, take a hike.
In this room here.
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.
I thought I could help you, Senator.
Hagen?
-Listen, I did not...
-It's all right.
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay. You're very lucky.
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.
Had this happened some place else, we couldn't have helped you.
When I woke up, I was on the floor.
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game. Jesus.
Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus God!
God!
I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember.
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl.
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
-Sorry, but we're not to let you through.
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City.
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
-No, within the compound will be fine.
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.
-Am I a prisoner?
-That's not how we see it, Kay.
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.
Joe.
Cuba, Cuba!
Most respected gentlemen.
Welcome to Havana.
I want to thank this distinguished group of American industrialists for continuing to work with Cuba for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history.
Mr. William Shaw, representing the General Fruit Company.
Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of United Telephone and Telegraph Company.
Mr. Petty,
Regional Vice President of the Pan American Mining Corporation.
Mr. Robert Allen of South American Sugar.
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada, representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities.
And my old friend and associate from Florida,
Mr. Hyman Roth.
I would like to thank United Telephone and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.
A solid gold telephone.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to look at it.
-Mr. President?
-Yes?
Could you discuss the rebel activity and what this can mean to our businesses?
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.
I assure you that, although the rebels have started a campaign in Las Villas, my staff indicates, with assurance, that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara before the New Year.
I want to put you all at ease.
We will tolerate no guerrillas in the casinos or the swimming pools.
He said that they're making an arrest, and in a few minutes he'll let us through.
Johnny...
It's nothing.
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.
Viva Fidel!
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.
Make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it.
I'm very pleased you're all able to come from such distances to be with me today.
When a man comes to this point in his life, he wants to turn over the things he's been blessed with.
Turn them over to friends, as a reward for the friends he's had and to make sure that everything goes well after he's gone.
-Not for years.
-Hear, hear!
We'll see. The doctors would disagree, but what do they know?
These are wonderful things that we've achieved in Havana and there's no limit to where we can go from here.
This kind of government knows how to help business, to encourage it.
The hotels here are bigger and swankier than any of the joints in Vegas.
We can thank our friends in the Cuban government which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis and has relaxed restrictions on imports.
What I'm saying is that we have now what we have always needed...
Real partnership with a government.
Smaller piece.
You all know Michael Corleone and we all remember his father.
At the time of my retirement, or death,
I turn over all my interests in the Havana operation to his control.
But, all of you will share.
The Nacionale will go to the Lakeville Road Boys, the Capri to the Corleone family, the Sevilla Biltmore also, but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,
Dino and Eddie, for a piece and to handle the casino operations.
We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested by the military police.
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket.
He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels for 50 years. It's in their blood.
I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties.
We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels.
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.
If I could only live to see it, to be there with you.
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
Here we are, protected. Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI.
90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government.
90 miles. It's nothing.
Just one small step for a man looking to be President of the United States and having the cash to make it possible.
Michael, we're bigger than U.S. Steel.
Mikey, how are you? Okay?
-Hi! Freddy Corleone.
-Mio frati.
Jesus Christ, what a trip!
I thought, "What if somebody knows what I've got in here".
Can you imagine that? Two million dollars on the seat next to me.
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.
You want to count it?
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.
That's great! Havana's great.
It's my kind of town.
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?
No. I've never met them.
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?
I thought maybe we'd go out together.
I know a place where we can spend some time together.
Sometimes I think I should have married a woman like you did. Like Kay.
Have kids. Have a family.
For once in my life, be more like
Pop.
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."
"You were left on the doorstep by gypsies."
Sometimes I think it's true.
You're no gypsy, Fredo.
Mikey, I was mad at you.
Why didn't we spend time like this before?
You want a drink, right? Waiter!
Por favor...
-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.
-That's it?
-That's it.
Uno Banana Daiquiri and a club soda.
Senator Geary flies in from Washington tomorrow with some government people.
I want you to show them a good time in Havana.
-That's my specialty, right?
-Can I trust you with something?
Of course, Mike.
Later in the evening we're all invited to the Presidential Palace to bring in the New Year.
After it's over they'll take me home in a military car, alone.
For my protection.
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.
-Who?
-Roth.
It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home.
It was Roth all along.
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.
But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out.
-How can I help?
-Just go along, as if you know nothing.
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow.
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English.
-Gracias, señor.
-Buenas noches.
-Honey, go to the casino.
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money. Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to... Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?
I know I didn't.
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.
During Prohibition we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune. Your father, too.
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.
Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.s going to the West Coast.
That kid's name was Moe Greene and the city he invented was Las Vegas.
This was a great man.
A man of vision and guts.
And there isn't even a plaque, signpost or statue of him in that town.
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
No one knows who gave the order.
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.
And I said to myself,
"This is the business we've chosen."
I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business.
That two million in a bag in your room...
I'm going in to take a nap.
When I wake, if the money is on the table, I know I have a partner.
If it isn't, I know I don't.
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.
Senator Payton from Florida...
Judge DeMalco from New York...
Senator Ream from Maryland...
Fred Corngold from UTT.
-That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
-He does?
Gentlemen, it's refill time!
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...
I think I'll try one of those redheaded Yolandas.
-That you got! Con gusto...
-Johnny!
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.
-We never met. Johnny Ola.
-Pleasure.
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!
-Feliz Año Nuevo!
-Happy New Year.
-Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
-Everybody stands.
-It's worth it. You won't believe this.
-I don't believe it already.
-50 dollars, right?
-You've got a bet, mister.
That's Superman.
Did I tell you or did I tell you?
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.
It's real. That's why he's called Superman.
Hey, Freddy, where did you find this place?
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!
-I see it, but still don't believe it!
-50 bucks, Pat.
Roth won't go here, but Johnny knows these places!
-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
-I want to see him break a brick!
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.
...and you'll continue to get those.
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country.
The American public believe in non-intervention...
Fredo! Where are you going?
I'm getting a real drink, because I can't...
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just long enough to bring in the New Year.
It's New Year's Eve. Come on, just for a minute.
There's a plane waiting to take us to Miami in an hour.
Don't make a big thing about it.
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...
...my position in Cuba is untenable.
I am resigning from office to avoid further bloodshed.
And I shall leave the city immediately.
I wish all of you good luck.
Salud!
Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!
Fredo!
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.
Roth is dead.
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.
Fredo!
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!
Al. Get me a wet towel.
Does Kay know I'm back?
My boy? Did you get him something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
-What was it, so I'll know.
It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in. It's nice.
Thank you, Al.
Fellows, could you step outside for a minute?
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What? Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.
Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods.
But you don't even send a dress to my house. No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
Give me $200 each, for your own protection. And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole - I'll take a little less.
And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less.
Now don't refuse me.
Understand, paisan?
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
Vito, leave this to us.
He's one person, we're three.
He's got guns, we've got guns.
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.
Who?
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!
We'll all be better off if we pay him. Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.
If Fanucci says $200...
...he means it, Vito!
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants. Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
Don't argue with him, since he's so tough.
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.
I was right.
Only $100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just give me a little time.
You understand, don't you?
You've got balls, young man!
How come I never heard of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work for good money.
No hard feelings, right? If I can help you, let me know.
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
Oh, this is too violent for me!
What've you got there?
Michael, your father loves you very much.
Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company?
That's right.
But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization.
No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator.
What was your position?
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.
-What is that?
-A button, you know, Senator.
No, I don't know. Tell me.
When the boss says "push a button" on a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?
Mr. Questadt.
-You mean you kill people?
-What?
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.
Yeah, that's right.
And the head of your family is Michael Corleone?
Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.
Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone?
No, I never talked to him.
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify your answer a bit?
-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?
I'm particularly interested in knowing, was there always a buffer involved?
Someone in between you and your superiors who gave the order.
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!
You may find this very amusing, but the members of this committee do not.
Tell me something, Ma.
What did Papa think... deep in his heart?
He was being strong...
Strong for his family.
But by being strong for his family...
...could he...
...lose it?
You're thinking about your wife... about the baby you lost.
But you and your wife can always have another baby.
No, I meant...lose his family.
But you can never lose your family.
Times are changing.
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.
Take it as a gift.
If there's something I can do for you, you come, we talk.
Signora Colombo, why did you come to see me?
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave.
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street.
I'm sorry, but...
I could give you a couple dollars to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.
They break the windows, they dirty the floors...
A real pig-sty, eh?
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted for no good reason.
She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her.
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
Are you Sicilian?
No, I'm Calabrese.
We're practically paisan, do me this favor.
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
Besides, the new tenants pay more rent.
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
Of course, the dog stays. Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here...Roberto, the one who owns those rat holes.
He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you.
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!
Because after all, Don Vito, money isn't everything.
Can I sit down?
Your kindness to that widow made me ashamed of myself.
The rent stays like before!
I'll even lower it.
I'll lower it $5.
I'll lower it $10!
Can I offer you some coffee?
I'm late for an appointment! I can't this time! Ask me another time!
You'll have to excuse me for now.
I wish I could stay longer!
Just call me and I'll be here!
He won't be back. He'll hide out in the Bronx!
-Vito, what do you think?
-We'll make a big business!
-New York City.
-Would you speak up, please?
New York City.
-Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
-Yes, I am.
-Where was he born?
-Corleone, Sicily.
Did he at times use an alias that was known in certain circles as Godfather?
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to verify the witness' statement.
For years many of my constituents have been of Italian descent.
I've come to know them well.
They have honored me with their support and their friendship.
I can proudly say that some of my very best friends are Italian-Americans.
However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings in order to preside over a very important meeting of my own committee.
Before I leave, I do want to say this, that these hearings on the Mafia are in no way whatsoever a slur upon the great Italian people.
I can state from my own knowledge and experience that Italian-Americans are among the most loyal, most law-abiding, patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.
It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman, if we allowed a few rotten apples to give a bad name to the whole barrel.
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi to the present day,
Italian-Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our nation.
They are the salt of the earth, and one of the backbones of this country.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.
Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.
We have testimony from a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.
He stated that you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in the country.
-Are you?
-No, I'm not.
He testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York police captain in 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.
-Do you deny this?
-Yes, I do.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of "the Five Families" in New York to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
-It's a complete falsehood.
-Mr. Questadt.
Is it true you have a controlling interest in three major hotels in Las Vegas?
No, it's not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels there, but very little.
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.
Do you have any control over gambling and narcotics in New York State?
No, I do not.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement.
Mr. Chairman, I think this statement is totally out of order at this time.
Sir, my client has answered this committee's questions with sincerity.
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment, so this statement should be heard!
No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read his statement. I'll put it in the record.
In the hopes of clearing my family name to give my children their share of the American way of life without a blemish on their name and background,
I have appeared before this committee and given it all my cooperation.
I consider it a great personal dishonor to have to deny that I am a criminal.
I wish to have the following noted for the record...
That I served my country faithfully in World War Two and was awarded the Navy Cross for actions in defense of my country.
That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime.
That no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or any other name has ever been made public.
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, although it's my right to do so.
I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have besmirched it.
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly with your love for our country.
We'll be in recess until 10:00 a.m. Monday when we will produce a witness who'll corroborate the charges against you.
At which time you may very well be subject to indictment for perjury.
I remind you that you're still under subpoena. Adjourned!
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
A ten-to-one shot he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.
-Well, just get a good night's sleep.
-Yeah.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I've got you a new suit, new shirt, new tie.
I'll shave you myself in the morning.
You'll look respectable for 50 million of your fellow Americans.
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Come on! I saw this 19 times.
You've got a great home here, for the rest of your life.
Nobody gets near you, you're not going anywhere.
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.
You'll live better here than most people outside.
Some deal!
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth. He engineered it, Michael.
When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him.
They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more.
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.
We can't get to him. You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.
Roth, he played this one beautifully.
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now? Is there anything you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
They've got Pentangeli.
I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike.
I swear to God I didn't know.
Johnny Ola bumped into me in Beverly Hills.
He said that he wanted to talk.
He said that you and Roth were in on a big deal together.
And that there was something in it for me if I could help him out.
He said that you were being tough on the negotiations but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast, it would be good for the family.
And you believed that story?
You believed that?
He said there was something in it for me, on my own!
-I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
-Taken care of me?
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?
"Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that!"
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."
"Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"
I'm your older brother, but was stepped over!
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. I'm smart and I want respect!
Is there anything you can tell me about this investigation? Anything more?
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.
Fredo, you're nothing to me now.
Not a brother, not a friend.
I don't want to know you, or what you do.
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there.
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.
There's more people than at a ballgame in here.
-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
-Frankie Five-Angels...
This committee will come to order!
-State your name, please.
-Frank Pentangeli.
-Where were you born?
-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.
Where do you live now?
I live in an army barracks with the FBI guys.
We have here a witness that will further testify to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling.
This witness has had no buffer between himself and Michael Corleone.
He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone.
-Senator.
-Thank you, Chairman.
Mr. Pentangeli.
Mr. Pentangeli. Were you a member of the Corleone family?
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather?
I never knew any Godfather.
I have my own family.
Mr. Pentangeli, you...
You are contradicting your own sworn statement.
I ask you again, sir, here and now under oath... were you at any time a member of a crime organization led by Michael Corleone?
I don't know nothing about that!
I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.
We have a sworn affidavit.
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone.
Do you deny this confession, and do you realize what will happen if you do?
The FBI guys promised me a deal so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.
But it was all lies. Everything!
They kept saying,
"Michael Corleone did this" and "Michael Corleone did that".
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify the gentleman sitting to your left?
I can answer that.
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
-Is he related to the witness?
-He is, I believe, his brother.
-Will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand English.
He came at his own expense to aid his brother.
He's not under subpoena and has an impeccable reputation.
-He knows nothing about this?
-To my knowledge, nothing.
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.
-The witness is excused.
-Senator!
Senator! This committee owes an apology!
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!
-Michael, excuse me.
-Hello, darling.
The children are outside. We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.
Rocco?
I'll be in my room, Mike.
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.
I brought the children to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, I'm not going to stay long.
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.
Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.
-I wasn't going to say anything...
-What do you mean, "too late"?
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.
All he had to do was show his face.
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.
You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave!
Things between men and women will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.
I never thought that would ever happen, but it has.
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?
-Michael, you haven't heard me.
-Kay, what do you want from me?
Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me?
Don't you know me? Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
In time, you'll feel differently.
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
I'll make it up to you, Kay.
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change. I've learned that I have the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.
-We'll go on.
-Oh, Michael!
Michael, you are blind.
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
I didn't want your son, Michael!
I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world!
It was an abortion, Michael.
It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end!
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.
There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me.
Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000...
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.
Allow me the honor of introducing someone.
My partner in America, in New York.
His name is Vito Corleone.
We'll send him olive oil from here.
To his company in America.
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.
We'd like your blessing, and your permission to start work.
Where is this young man from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...Antonio Andolini.
Louder, I don't hear so good.
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...
...and this is for you!
Michael, say goodbye.
Hi, Al.
Can I speak with you for a second, Tom?
Tom, where's Mike?
Waiting for you to leave.
-Can I talk with him?
-Sorry, Fredo. No chance.
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.
Michael, it's Connie.
Michael...
I'd like to stay close to home now, if it's all right.
Is Kay coming?
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Please, I want to talk to you.
Michael, I hated you for so many years.
I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know that I could hurt you.
You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was.
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
He's so sweet, and helpless without you.
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
Tom, sit down.
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there.
His passport's been invalidated, except to return here.
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
-That's right. That's where I want it met.
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
-Tom, you surprise me.
If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone.
-Rocco?
-Difficult. Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it, are they strong enough?
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.
Are you with me in these things, or what?
Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas.
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. What is this?
So...you're staying?
Yes, I'm staying.
What do you want me to do?
Hey, Anthony.
How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
You know, when I was your age,
I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father. Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
-Yeah, don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home.
That's my brother! Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie.
You were always interested in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33.
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.
You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".
-And it worked.
-Yeah, it worked.
Those were the great old days, you know.
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, it was once.
Frankie.
When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors.
Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened.
And their families were taken care of.
That was a good break, a nice deal.
Yeah.
They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party before they did it.
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.
-See you, Tom.
-Addio, Frankie.
Kay. You have to go.
-So pretty...
-Kay, please hurry. He's coming.
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.
Kay, please.
All right.
Mary, come here.
Anthony.
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.
Easy.
Anthony! Anthony!
-He's here, we're going fishing.
-No!
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.
Shit!
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno with your pop.
-I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.
Hey, Anthony.
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.
Let's go.
-Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody.
-I understand.
What's your reaction to the Israeli High Court ruling?
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life.
Hey, Frankie! Come on out, let's play some Hearts.
Frankie!
Is it true you're worth over 300 million dollars?
I'm a retired investor, living on a pension.
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot.
Jesus Christ.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners.
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa.
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Sit down. Talk to each other.
Hey, Mr. Einstein...
-The cake.
-Sally, get in here!
-I was scared.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah. You help her, Carlo.
-What is that? Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
-30,000 enlisted this morning.
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
-You're right, that's Pop talking!
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college and join the army!
I did.
I've enlisted in the Marines.
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.
I didn't want it.
Come on! Knock it off!
-Punk!
-Sonny, sit down.
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!
Go and show Carlo the tree.
Nice.
Break your father's heart on his birthday.
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.
Don't encourage him!
Get me a drink. Go on!
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.
Many times he and I have talked about your future.
You've talked to my father about my future?
-My future.
-Mikey, he has high hopes for you.
-I have my own plans for my future.
-Did you go to college to get stupid?
He's here!
Come on.
Stupid!
Surprise!
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States.
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.
It soon became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jails.
Of the 125,000 refugees that landed in Florida, an estimated 25,000 had criminal records.
...they are unwilling to adapt to the spirit of our revolution.
We don't want them!
We don't need them!
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA
What do you call yourself?
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.
And my father, he was from the United States.
Just like you, you know?
He was a Yankee.
He used to take me a lot to the movies.
I learned.
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.
Sometime. Somewhere.
Mother?
She dead, too.
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.
I was this, that.
Construction business.
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?
Nobody. Everybody's dead.
You ever been to jail, Tony?
Me? Jail? No way, no.
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?
You like to dress up like a woman?
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?
Just answer the questions, Tony.
Okay. No.
Fuck, no.
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?
Never, man.
Heroin?
Cocaine?
No.
Where'd you get the beauty scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?
How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy?
This was when I was a kid, you know?
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.
And this?
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.
Sweetheart, my ass! We've been seeing more and more of these.
Some kind of code these guys used in the can.
Pitchfork means an assassin or something.
You want to tell us about it...
or you want to take a trip to the detention centre?
Okay, you got me.
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.
It was a Canadian tourist.
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!
Come on!
So I fuck up!
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.
You a Communist?
How'd you like it?
They tell you always what to do, what to think, what to feel.
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?
I don't have to listen to this!
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!
Do you want a chivato on every corner... watching everything you do?
Everything you say, man?
You know I eat octopus three times a day?
I got fucking octopus coming out of my ears.
I got fucking Russian shoes, my feet's coming through.
How'd you like that?
You want me to stay there and do nothing?
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.
I'm Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuba.
I want my fucking human rights, now!
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.
Get him out of here.
Know something?
You can send me anywhere.
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.
There's nothing you can do to me that Castro hasn't done...
Get him out of here!
So?
So?
What'd you tell them?
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.
They didn't go for it.
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.
I told you to tell them you was in a sanatarium, not sanitation.
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.
No, I told you to say you had TB and you was in a sanatarium.
You was cured.
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.
They'd think you was a horse and let you out.
ONE MONTH LATER
Tony! Montana!
Tony Montana! Come here.
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.
Come on, man. It's important.
So close, man.
Come on.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.
Are you ready for some good news?
Sure. What you got, man?
We can be outta this place in 30 days.
Not only that, but we got a green card and a job in Miami.
Now are we made or are we made, man?
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?
- No.
- You're not kidding?
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.
Rebenga?
- I know that name.
- Yeah?
- He's political.
- Yeah.
Well, he's coming in here today. Castro just sprung him.
This guy was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days.
Castro felt he couldn't trust him and threw him in jail.
But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death.
One of the guy's brothers is a rich guy in Miami now.
He wants the favor repaid.
That's where we come in.
It's ugly, man.
Yeah.
You tell your guys in Miami, your friend... it'd be a pleasure.
I'd kill a Communist for fun... but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.
Libertad! Libertad!
Rebenga!
From a friend you fucked!
That face. That's nice.
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.
Fuck!
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon.
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.
He's coming!
What do you want from me?
Fucking thing!
I told you.
What's wrong?
Look at that one.
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.
Look at those titties.
Look at that punk with her.
What's he got that I don't have?
Well, he's very handsome, for one thing, you know?
I mean, look at the way he dresses.
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.
And a little coke money doesn't hurt nobody.
Look at this.
Fucking onions.
They ought to be picking gold from the street.
There's two guys looking for you out there.
That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.
Don't stay too fucking long.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Waldo! Good to see you, man.
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.
Tony, that's Omar Suarez, and that's Waldo Rojas over there.
I got something for you.
Yeah? What do we gotta do?
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.
Who do you think we are, baggage handlers?
The going rate on a boat is $1,000 a night.
You know that.
First you gotta work your way up to $500.
What I did for you in Freedom Town, what was that?
That Rebenga hit was a game of dominoes?
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.
What's with this dishwasher, chico?
Don't he know we could've got any space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?
- Then why didn't you?
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher, or I'll kick your monkey ass.
Who the fuck are you?
You can't do that, man!
The Colombians!
Okay, all right, big man!
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.
You know something about cocaine?
You kidding me or what?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday.
New guys. They say they got two keys for us, for openers.
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.
If it's what they say, pay 'em and bring it back.
Do that, you get $5,000.
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?
You know how to handle a machine gun?
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.
Be at Hector's Bodega at noon Friday.
You get the buy money then.
If anything happens to that buy money... my boss will stick your heads up your asses... faster than a rabbit gets fucked!
I'm scared.
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.
You'll have a heart attack.
You act like that guy's doing you a favor or something.
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?
He says "Colombians," and you make these eyes...
I don't like fucking Colombians, okay?
What you guys doing?
There's a lot of dishes to be washed.
Wash 'em yourself.
I retire!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.
Not that one, man! That one!
Which one?
The young one.
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!
The money stays in the trunk till I come out.
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.
I'm not out in 15 minutes, something's wrong. Okay?
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?
So my brother-in-law sees everything's okay.
Sure. No problem.
No problem.
Hello. This is Marta.
Marta, hello.
I am Hector.
And I am Tony.
So, Omar says you're okay.
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.
Okay.
So, you got the money?
You got the stuff?
Sure I have the stuff, but not right here with me now.
I got it close by.
I don't have the money either, man.
I have it close by, too.
Where?
In the car?
No, not in the car, man.
No?
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?
Not far.
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?
Where you from, Tony?
What the fuck difference does it make where I'm from?
Take it easy, man.
I just want to get to know who I do business with.
You'll know me once you do business with me and stop fucking around.
Okay?
What's the story?
Tony!
You know, Frog Face, you just fucked yourself.
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?
You want to give me the cash... or do I kill your brother first... before I kill you?
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass?
See if it fits.
Yeah? Okay.
It's very important.
I understand.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You forecasted an earthquake...
in the 3-to-4-point range this morning.
We had an earthquake in the 3-to-4-point range.
I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.
However, isn't it rather slender evidence...
You have such beautiful skin.
I like the way you...
I don't know what I'm supposed to do today, but...
Antonio, mira!
Watch what happens to your friend.
If you don't want this to happen to you... give me the money.
Come on, come on.
Now the leg.
Let's do it, man. Come on.
We're all gonna be all right.
Okay, cara cicatriz.
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.
Last chance, pendejo!
Fuck you!
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.
Okay, take him out of here, quick!
Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.
- Your turn.
- I kill you!
Die!
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!
Close the door!
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.
Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.
You do that, Omar. You do that.
You still got the money?
Yeah.
And I got the yeyo.
You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.
Bring it here.
Fuck you.
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.
Not you, me.
Nice fucking guy.
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.
You can call me Frank.
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.
Even the fucking prosecutors around town... they all call me Frank.
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?
Manny Ribera.
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.
We heard about that.
Omar, he tells me great things about you guys.
Well, Omar's okay.
Not to mention, of course, the nice job you did for me.
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.
- That was fun.
- That was fun?
- Damn right.
- That was fun.
Sometimes it's fun.
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.
I need a guy with steel in his balls, Tony.
A guy like you. And I need him around me all the time.
You, Tony, and your compadre here.
Here's the stuff.
Two keys.
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.
My gift to you.
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.
If people would do business the right way... there'd be no fuck-ups like this.
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.
You're gonna find, you stay loyal in this business... you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.
And you'll find out your biggest problem... is not bringing in the stuff... but what to do with all the fucking cash!
I hope I have that problem someday.
You'll have that problem, don't worry.
Sit down over here.
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?
Jesus! Fucking broad.
She spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.
Gotta get her in between.
She's coming.
Yeah.
You gotta jump on her when she's not looking.
That's the best time.
What are you guys doing tonight?
You wanna go to a nice restaurant with me? You hungry?
I could eat a horse.
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?
It's nothing.
It went right through me.
It hit the wall.
I ran out of bullets like an asshole.
When I changed the clip, a guy who I thought I killed...
wasn't dead and shot me.
The guy was behind me. I killed him.
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.
Nine millimeter.
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.
Where you going? Come on.
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana. Elvira.
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?
I thought we'd go to the Babylon Club.
- Again?
- Again.
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted to assassinate you... you wouldn't be too hard to find.
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?
I got nothing but friends!
You never know. Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.
The catcher? That son of a bitch, he didn't get a base hit all season.
I should kill him!
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.
They got the biggest distribution set-up from here to Houston...
Tucson, all down that way.
What do you think of that?
Look.
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.
El Gordo!
He's got more cash than anybody in this place.
He's a real chazer!
You know what a chazer is?
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.
Lesson Number 1:
Don't underestimate... the other guy's greed!
Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.
'Course, not everybody follows the rules.
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.
Omar, you pour it, and you bring another bottle right away, will you?
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.
So, here's to old friends and to new friends.
How you like it, Tony?
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.
I'm gonna get you $550 suits... so you look real sharp.
'Cause I want you to work for me.
I want you and your boys to work with Omar here.
We are going to do... something big next month.
We are running a string of mules from Colombia.
You do good on that, there'll be some other things.
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.
You want a cigar?
You wanna dance, Frank, or sit here and have a heart attack?
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.
Don't foam into the Dommie P.
How about you?
What? You want me to dance?
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.
Go on. Have some fun.
What do you think of him?
I think he's a fucking peasant!
But you get a guy like that on your side... he breaks his back for you.
- What's your name?
- What?
What's your name? Elvira what?
- Hancock.
- What?
- Hancock!
- Hancock?
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.
Flying around.
Where you from?
- Baltimore.
- What?
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?
I'm just trying to be friendly.
I don't need another friend... especially one who just got off a banana boat.
Banana boat?
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.
You're thinking of someone else, maybe.
Aren't you part of the Cuban crime wave?
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.
I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.
What is your problem, baby?
You're good-looking.
You got a beautiful body, beautiful legs... a beautiful face, all these guys in love with you.
Only you got a look in your eye... like you haven't been fucked in a year!
Hey, José.
Who, why, when and how I fuck is none of your business, okay?
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.
Not yet, but you gotta give me some time.
Even if I were blind, desperate... starved and begging for it on a desert island... you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.
That chick he's with...
Yeah?
She likes me.
She likes you? How do you know?
I know.
The eyes, chico. They never lie.
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?
That's the boss's lady, okay?
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.
That guy's soft.
Look in his face.
The booze and the concha tell him what to do.
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time we were in a fucking cage, okay?
You remember.
I'd like to forget that.
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?
The world, chico... and everything in it.
THREE MONTHS LATER
This is paradise.
This is paradise, I'm telling you.
This town's like a great big pussy just waiting to get fucked.
I should've come here 10 years ago.
I'd have been a millionaire by this time.
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat... my own car, my own golf course.
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.
A line of blue jeans.
With my name written on the back of chicks' asses.
How's that?
That sounds completely crazy to me.
Look at that. Look.
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.
We're missing the action.
Want to have some ice cream with my friend and me?
Get lost, greaseball!
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.
You can't do it that way.
You know how you pick up chicks in this country?
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.
Figures you wouldn't understand.
But the women in this country, when you do that, they know.
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.
It'll take practice, but you gotta learn.
'Cause women love when you suck the pussy.
Look at that.
She's looking at us.
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.
I'm with you, man.
I'm gonna get her.
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.
You want to see something funny?
Take a look over there.
See that man?
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.
I gotta watch my friend.
He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.
Look at that.
You're sick!
You see what happened to him?
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.
Causing trouble like that, come on.
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?
What I try to tell you?
This country, you gotta make the money first.
Then when you get the money, you get the power.
Then when you get the power, then you get the women.
That's why you gotta make your own moves.
That's the one I rented.
No. That's her, man. There she is.
About time.
Frank got held up at the golf course.
He told me to pick you up.
He said he'd meet us at the track later.
He said to bet on Ice Cream in the first, by the way.
In that thing? You must be kidding.
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.
It's got a few years, but it's a cream puff.
It looks like somebody's nightmare.
So, you like this better?
It's like one of them tigers from India.
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.
He says he's gonna buy one.
You do that and you won't have any friends left.
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.
You gonna drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat?
Maybe. Some lady tiger.
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.
Bullet-proof this, okay?
And this here and here.
And the windows.
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.
And a radio with scanners... to pick up flying saucers, stuff like that.
Don't forget the fog lights.
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!
I thought you were taking me to Frank.
We got an hour. You hungry?
No, but I'm bored.
Well, that figures.
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?
Good doing business with you.
I wouldn't buy the car if you didn't like it.
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you, Tony?
Yeah. You know who?
What would Frank say?
I like Frank, you know?
Only I like you better.
- You got some for me?
- Sure.
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.
Shit.
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
No!
Playtime is over, okay?
Mama?
Long time.
No postcards from jail?
Gina.
- Tony?
- Look at you.
You're beautiful.
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.
Look at that. She looks like me.
You know the last time I saw you, you was like that.
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.
I got something for you.
It's no big deal.
I never thought I'd see you again, you know?
You think they'd keep a guy like me down?
Well, no.
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.
- For me?
- I think so.
It's nothing much, you know, nothing.
See what's written on the back?
On the back?
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!
Mama is still working in the factory... and I work part-time in a beauty parlor.
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!
All that's over, starting today.
Why?
My kid sister don't have to work in no beauty parlor, and Mama... she don't have to sew in no factory.
Your son made it, Mama.
He's a success.
That's why
I didn't come around before.
I want you to see what a good boy I've been.
Here's $1,000.
For you, Mama.
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.
No?
No.
What are you doing now?
Banks, or is it still bodegas, you and the others?
No! Things are different now.
I'm working with an anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now.
I get a lot of political contributions.
Sure you do.
A gun sticking in somebody's face is how.
You know, all we hear about in the papers... is animals like you and the killings.
It's Cubans like you who are giving a bad name to our people.
People who come here, work hard and make a good name for themselves.
People who send their children to school.
What are you saying?
That's your son...
Son? I wish I had one.
He's a bum.
He was a bum then and he's a bum now.
Who do you think you are?
We haven't heard a word from you in five years.
You suddenly show up here, throw some money around... and think you can get my respect.
You think you can buy me with jewellery?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes... and your jail manners and make fun of us?
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!
You are not going to destroy her.
I don't need your money.
I work for my living.
I don't want you in this house anymore!
I don't want you around Gina.
So come on. Get out!
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.
Why do you have to spoil it for everybody?
I'm sorry, Tony.
Okay, Mama.
No. Tony, wait a minute!
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!
Tony, wait, please!
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...
Forget Papa. We never had one.
I know you did some bad things back then.
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.
The Communists... they're always trying to tell you what to do.
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.
I just... I don't know.
I just want you to know that I don't care.
It doesn't matter to me how long you've been away, five or ten years.
You're my blood, always.
I know.
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.
What will I tell her?
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.
Don't tell her I gave it to you, but give her some from time to time.
And listen, you go out yourself.
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.
You gotta get some fun out of life.
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
A pussycat like you? Come here.
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to you.
Let's go.
She's beautiful. How come you...
Stay away from her. You hear?
She's not for you.
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production... of 200 kilos refined every month of the year.
The problem is,
I have no steady market.
Basically, what I'm looking for is somebody in the States... who can share the risk with me, somebody who can guarantee... to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come... but with his trial coming up, it's hard to leave the country.
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.
We'll talk at my house, shall we?
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.
This Lopez guarantees to buy 150 kilos from me... every month of the year.
He picks it up here.
I can sell it to him for as little as...
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.
But then we got to take the risk of moving it.
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?
That means we have to go to war with them.
We cut out the Colombians, we take risks on both sides.
Why don't we split the risk?
You guarantee your delivery, say, as far as Panama... we take it from there.
Panama is risky. It costs me more.
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.
$13,500? What, are you nuts?
$13,500? We still got to take that shit to Florida.
Do you know what that's like these days?
You got the Navy everywhere.
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s with the satellite-tracking shit.
You got the fucking Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.
We're losing one out of every nine loads.
That's no duckwalk anymore, let me tell you.
Forget about $13,500.
What do you suggest that is reasonable?
Excuse me. One moment.
What the fuck's the matter with you?
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.
If he wants to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.
Fuck you. How's that?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
You need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut.
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.
Why not talk to him?
You think he wants to give you the money?
Shut the fuck up.
I'm doing the talking here, not you.
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.
Close your mouth.
I can't wait to see what Frank's gonna react to this one.
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.
Now where were we?
Panama.
You're looking for a partner, right?
Something like that.
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves.
I am down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it.
That's my limit. I got no right.
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?
Let him propose a proposition, then we can talk more.
You got no authority here.
I started you in this business, so shut the fuck up.
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.
No, it is all right.
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.
Well, good.
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.
Good.
My associates can escort you to my chopper...
to take you to Santa Cruz.
I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.
You'll be back here tomorrow in time for lunch.
Good.
Good talking to you.
Why not leave your friend here?
While you're gone, he can tell me how to run my business.
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him.
I guess so.
Let's finish our lunch.
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.
You got everything a man could want.
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about the rest of your organization.
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch...
from several years ago in New York.
He was an informer for the police.
He put Vito Duval and Nello and Gino Ramos away for life.
So how do I know you're not a chivato, too, Tony?
Let's get this straight now.
I've never fucked anybody over who didn't have it coming.
You got that?
All I have in this world is my balls and my word.
I don't break them for no one, you understand?
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...
I never trusted him.
For all I know, he had me set up... and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.
You want to go on with me, say it.
You don't, then you make a move.
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.
But I say to myself... this Lopez, your boss...
he had chivatos like that working for him.
His judgment stinks.
So I think to myself... how many other mistakes has this Lopez guy made?
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.
Frank is smart, you know?
You can't blame him for that animal.
It's a crazy business we're in, you know?
That could happen to anyone, even you.
Why don't I go back and talk to Frank... and work it out?
I'll fix things between us.
You got my word on that.
I think you and me, we can work this thing out... we do business together for a long time.
Just remember...
I'll only tell you one time... don't fuck me, Tony.
Don't you ever try to fuck me.
You what?
You made a deal for fucking $18 million... without even checking with me?
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?
- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!
At $10,500 a key. It's puro.
You can't lose money. No way.
We make $75 million on this deal.
$75 million.
That is serious money.
What is Sosa going to do... when I don't come up with the first $5 million?
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.
I make a couple of moves... a million here, a million there, you got it.
You've been making moves on your own?
I got ears, you know? I hear things.
What do you hear about Echevierra and the Diaz brothers?
What about Gomez?
What'll he do when you start moving 2,000 keys...
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and fuck the Diaz brothers!
Fuck 'em all!
I'll bury those cockroaches!
What they ever do for us?
Look, Frank, the time has come.
We gotta expand.
The whole operation. Distribution.
New York, Chicago, LA.
We gotta set our own mark and enforce it.
We gotta think big now.
Think big.
Like your friend Sosa.
Let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker.
He is a snake, that's what he is.
You turn your back on him, he'll stick it in.
You don't trust a guy like that.
You want me to believe...
Omar was a stoolie because Sosa said so?
You bought that line?
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there.
Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know.
Like what?
Like what?
You tell me, "Like what."
You calling me a liar, Frank?
That what you're calling me?
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are for now.
You stall your deal with Sosa.
Stall it?
Okay, boss.
Come on.
I am the boss.
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.
Remember I told you when you started... the guys who last in this business... are the guys who fly straight...
low-key, quiet.
And the guys who want it all...
chicas, champagne, flash... they don't last.
You finished?
Can I go now?
Hi, there.
You just missed Frank.
Too bad.
Only I didn't come to see Frank.
This is not the time or the place, Tony.
Make an appointment.
That's okay.
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.
So why don't we have a couple of drinks...
act normal...
and just take it easy.
Come on. I like Scotch.
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.
We're all normal here.
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.
That's right.
I think it's easier, don't you?
Makes things easier.
Thank you.
Here's to "the land of opportunity."
For you, maybe.
You like kids?
Kids?
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.
Sure. Why not?
As long as there's a nurse.
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.
Frank's gonna be back any minute.
Come here.
Sit here.
I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.
Okay, here's the story.
I come from the gutter. I know that.
I got no education... but that's okay.
I know the street... and I'm making all the right connections.
With the right woman, there's no stopping me.
I could go right to the top.
Anyway... what I got to tell you is this:
I like you.
I liked you the first time I laid eyes on you.
I said, "She's a tiger.
"She'll belong to me."
Anyway...
I want you to marry me.
I want you to be the mother of my children.
Me? Marry you?
That's right.
What about Frank, Tony?
What will you do about Frank?
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.
Just think about it, okay?
I want you to really think about it.
I'll go now. Take care.
All your enemies are gone.
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.
What the fuck she doing here?
Come on, man. She's just dancing. Come on. Take it easy.
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?
He's some guy who works for Luco. He's nobody.
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?
Yeah. Forget him.
Hello, Tony. You remember me?
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?
Chief Detective, Narcotics.
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.
No, not lately.
What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?
Whoever's giving you your information... is taking you for a long ride.
Tony, baby, we gonna talk... or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls... here and now?
Keep your eye on her.
I'll do that.
Okay.
- My office.
- Good.
The word on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.
That means you're not a small-time punk anymore... you're public property now.
Supreme Court says that your privacy can be invaded.
Okay. How much?
How much?
There's an answer to that, too.
Here's how much.
Can you see it?
- Big number.
- Yeah!
That's on a monthly basis, same thing every month.
You know how this works?
No. You tell me.
We tell you who's moving against you... and we shake down who you want shaken down.
Let's say that you got a real problem making a collection.
And then we step in for you.
Got eight killers with badges working for me.
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.
You feed me a bust now and then.
Some cowboy setting himself up in business.
Small fry, you know?
We like snacks.
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?
How do I know what rock they're gonna crawl out from under?
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.
You think I want this conversation going any farther than this table?
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.
I don't want to see them embarrassed.
If they're embarrassed, they'll suffer.
If they suffer, they'll make you suffer.
You understand what I'm talking about?
Thanks for the drink.
By the way...
I got a vacation coming up.
I'm gonna take the wife to London, England.
We've never been there.
So throw in a couple of round-trip tickets, first class.
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.
Every day above ground is a good day.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Yeah. Now that's the idea.
Okay, Mel.
You think about what I said?
About the kids?
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.
Why don't you find your own girl?
My own girl?
Yeah.
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't hear anything if you go on like this.
Will you do something?
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!
I'm giving you orders. Blow!
Orders? You giving me orders?
The only thing in this world... that gives orders is balls.
You got that?
Balls.
Let's go.
Elvira.
When you gonna learn?
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.
That cocksucker.
What happened?
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?
How do you know?
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?
He's fertilizer.
He's letting me know he's got weight on me.
I'll tell you what, man.
You know our little trip we've been planning to New York?
It might be a good time.
Wait. Where you going?
Welcome to my private room.
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.
I got a beautiful, nice, white lounge chair for you.
Gina, you taste so muy bueno.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!
Get out!
Damn you!
You think he's cute?
I saw him putting his hand all over your ass.
My kid sister in a toilet.
It's none of your business.
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!
Listen to me. Come here.
I catch you here again, I'm gonna wipe you all over the fucking place.
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!
You think you can tell me what to do?
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.
I'll do what I want to do, see whoever I want to see.
And if I want to fuck them, then I'll fuck them!
Fucking, man! Come on, man.
What the fuck you want?
You want something?
No. Don't touch me.
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.
Another great night here at the Babylon?
Okay. All right!
Do another gram, you'll all be babbling on.
Is that coke in your bra, or are you just glad to see me?
A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.
I'm in a good mood. I was depressed when I got up this morning.
I had a dry dream, but I'm better now.
I do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish, too.
That's the height of culture,
I assure you.
But my favorite Cuban of all time has to be Ricky Ricardo.
Mr. Babalu himself.
He had the same problem for 10 years.
"Lucy, don't come down to the club."
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.
All right? He cares about you.
To him, you're still his little sister.
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.
I'm 20 years old now.
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?
Right now, you happen to be the best thing in his life.
The only thing that's any good, that's pure.
Of course he doesn't want you mixing with those people... growing up to be like him.
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.
Protect me against what?
Against guys like that asshole you were dancing with tonight.
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.
By taking her to the toilet to make out?
You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.
Here's a guy I found in the jungle.
From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.
Give a warm Babylon welcome to the one and only Octavio!
Look around. Go out with someone who has something on the ball...
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?
For instance, someone who's got a real job, like a banker.
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?
Are you crazy?
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.
What?
Look, Gina...
Tony and I are like brothers, all right?
You're his kid sister.
- So what?
- That's where it ends.
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!
That's not the point here!
It's not for me. Don't look at me.
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.
Really? Then where are you?
Shit, you're weird.
- I'm weird?
- Hello?
Hello, Miriam?
Tony!
Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second.
It's Tony.
What are you doing, checking up on me?
Get your clothes on and meet me... in front of Lopez Motors in 45 minutes.
What? What happened?
Nothing we can't face.
All right. I'll be there.
You're still on the phone. Let's go.
Take it easy, okay?
I'm leaving now. Fuck.
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.
This is what
I want you to do for me:
You call Lopez.
Call him at his office at 3:00 sharp.
And you tell him:
"We fucked up, he got away."
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?
"We fucked up. He got away."
What time?
3:00 sharp.
So when are we gonna make some money on this thing?
Six months to start don't mean shit, Larry.
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.
So you owe me.
Listen, go down to the ball game tonight.
I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?
Mel, guess what?
My Little League team, the Little Lopezers... they won the division tonight.
That's great. Congratulations.
What'd you do, fix the umpire?
Jesus Christ.
Tony, what happened to you?
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.
Who the fuck did this?
Hitters. I don't know.
Somebody must've brought them in.
I've never seen them before.
Hello, Mel.
Got an answer to this, too?
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.
They got a beef going back to the Sun Ray thing.
Maybe you're right, you know?
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.
We'll return the favor for you, in spades.
I'll take care of this myself.
What is the gun for, Tony?
What, this? It's nothing.
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.
You gonna answer, Frank?
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.
Hello.
It's all right. I'm gonna be home in an hour. Don't worry.
Frank, you're a piece of shit.
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about... you fucking cockroach.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
You know what a chazer is, Frank?
That's a pig that don't fly straight.
Neither do you, Frank.
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?
I brought you in.
So we had a few differences, no big deal.
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.
I stayed loyal to you.
I made what I could on the side, but I never turned on you, Frank!
Never!
But you... a man who ain't got his word is a cockroach.
Mel. Do something, will you?
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.
All right, Tony. I was the one.
Please, give me a second chance.
Will you do that? Please?
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.
Okay? $10 million.
I got it in a vault over there in Spain, Tony.
We go over there, we get on a plane, and it's yours.
Okay? All of it. $10 million.
Okay, Tony?
Please, Tony?
Elvira? You want Elvira?
You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.
I never did nothing to nobody.
No, you never did nothing to nobody.
You had somebody else do it for you.
Tony, I'm begging you.
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.
I won't kill you.
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!
No! No!
Every dog has his day, Mel?
I told him... it didn't make any sense... clipping you when we had you working for us. He wouldn't listen.
He got hot tonight about the broad.
He fucked up.
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.
Don't go too far, Tony.
I'm not, Mel. You are.
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!
Whoever says you was one?
Wait a minute!
You let me go. I'll fix this up.
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself... one of them first-class tickets to the Resurrection.
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?
You want a job, Ernie?
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.
Man, you got a job!
Tony! Thanks.
God, what's happened?
Where's Frank?
Where do you think?
Come on. Get your stuff.
You're coming with me.
So you come to me with some kind of thing. Okay.
You propose it, I talk to you.
But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.
I'm bringing in twice as much as I ever did before.
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.
That's serious money.
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.
No way.
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me... the harder it is for me to rinse.
That's a problem. I didn't know.
The fact is, I can't take any more of your money... unless I raise the rates on you.
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.
The IRS is coming...
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.
I'm talking.
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.
The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida.
There was a Time Magazine story that didn't help.
There's a recession.
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.
I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...
6% on your fives.
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!
I'll fly the cash myself to the Bahamas.
Once, maybe. Then what?
You'll trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank... with 20 million of your hard-earned dollars?
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.
Who else can you trust?
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.
Did you hear that guy?
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.
Stay with us.
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.
That prick!
Fucking WASP whore.
Talking to me like I'm some maricón who came over on a boat.
I tell you what. We don't need that smiling motherfucker.
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.
And he's connected.
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.
I don't trust them.
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?
- Look at that.
- What?
That cable truck there.
Since when does it take three days to rig a cable?
What? You been watching it for three days?
The thing has been there for three days.
What am I gonna do, not look at it?
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.
Could be the Diaz brothers, coming to get me.
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.
Then we're gonna blow that fucking truck back to Colombia!
Come on. We're not the only dopers living on the block.
Okay? Remember that.
That truck could be anybody and anything.
It could be a cable company...
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.
For someone who's in charge of my security...
Here are the keys to the front door.
Go down there. Give them the keys!
I'm just trying to say something.
You're spending a lot of money on this counter-surveillance.
I don't give a fuck.
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.
12% isn't peanuts.
I don't give a fuck!
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.
Our thinking, our fucking attitude, you know?
We're not fucking hungry anymore.
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.
New construction. New jobs.
Growth that's financed by Florida Security Trust.
We've put your money to work for 75 years...
building a more prosperous Miami.
Count on us being here tomorrow.
That's because for 75 years you been fucking everybody.
Somebody should do something about those whores.
I mean, charging me 10 points on my money.
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.
True capitalist if ever I met one.
Did you hear that?
How would you know, bubblehead?
You ever do nothing besides get your hair fixed... and powder your nose?
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.
Nothing exceeds like excess.
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?
What should I know?
Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time?
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.
Listen.
What time is it?
This Seidelbaum.
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...
The drug-related violence that's plagued South Florida...
He's good for a laugh, this guy.
With a small law-enforcement budget, how can you put a dent...
on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?
It seems at times all you can do...
is put your finger in the dike and pray.
Put your fingers in a dyke?
The only place you can get your fingers... is in some dyke.
Not by outlawing the substances, but by legalizing and taxing them.
These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element.
I am not one of those voices.
I know that. But you know why?
'Cause you got your head up your culo, that's why.
That fucking guy, he never tells the truth.
... splendor of our city at its best.
It's those guys, man!
It's the fucking bankers, the politicians... they're the ones that wanna make coke illegal!
So they can make the fucking money, and then get the fucking votes!
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!
They fuck anything and anyone.
Can't you stop saying "fuck" all the time?
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?
You're boring.
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.
That's 'cause he was so smart.
You know what you're becoming?
You're an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking...
Who the fuck you calling a "spic," you white piece of bread?
Get out of the way of the TV!
Dig a hole in the yard, bury it, and forget about it.
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.
Know what your problem is, pussycat?
What is my problem?
You got nothing to do with your life.
Why don't you get a job or something?
Do something. Be a nurse.
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.
Anything beats lying around all day waiting for me to fuck you!
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.
No? Frank was better?
You're an asshole!
Where you going? Come here!
Elvie!
I was kidding!
I was only kidding!
I guess sometimes married life is not all it's cracked up to be.
- Where you going?
- I got a date.
You got a date? Come here.
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.
Yeah, it's all set up.
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.
You like the ladies more than the money.
That's your problem.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?
If you don't trust me with that kind of thing... who're you gonna trust?
Junior partner.
Bullshit, man.
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.
You are an asshole, man!
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.
Fuck you, man!
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!
Who do I trust? Me!
Fuck him. "Trust."
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.
I need that shit.
I don't need him.
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.
Back then I worked in pictures down in Colombia.
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.
- I was his driver.
- No shit?
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.
Italian guy.
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?
Do you know Benny Alvarez?
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?
- Subtotal.
- No?
He's a nice guy.
You want a company cheque here?
I got $284,600.
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.
This cheque here, where does this check go?
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?
Montana Realty Company.
Montana Realty Company.
That's $284,000.
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.
You ask him.
We're up to what?
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.
$200,000 more.
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!
Get your hands up!
Go against the wall, turn around.
You're not kidding.
You're under arrest for violation of the RICO Statute.
"You have the right to remain silent.
"Anything you say can and will be taken against you."
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.
You see that eye there in the clock?
Say, "Hi, honey."
That's pretty cute. Look at that.
You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?
I was supposed to meet this chick at 3:00.
You're a fucking pain in the ass.
All right, Benny, kill it.
You understand the rights
I've given you?
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!
Save your breath.
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.
I'm changing dollar bills, that's all.
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer... that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska.
So dress warm.
Give me a cheque for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.
I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge.
They're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion... and they'll get it.
So, what am I looking at here?
Five years. You'll be out in three.
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.
Three fucking years!
For what?
Washing money? The fucking country was built on washed money.
Can't be that bad.
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...
Fuck you, man!
I'm not going back in any cage, okay?
No way. I been there.
Okay, look.
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.
With that kind of money, you can buy the Supreme Court.
Tony, the law has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000... undeclared staring into a videotape camera... honey baby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxicab.
I'm so glad you could come on such short notice.
I really appreciate it.
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?
When you gonna have another Tony to take your place?
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.
I want you to meet some of my friends.
This is Pedro Quinn... chairman of the Andes Sugar Corporation.
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.
Pleasure.
This is Ariel Bleyer... with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?
Sit here, Tony.
Gentlemen.
I would like to discuss something... that is of interest to all of us here.
You have a problem, Tony.
We have a problem.
I think together we can solve all our problems.
We all know you have tax troubles in your country...
and that you may have to do a little time.
We have friends in Washington... that assure us these troubles can be taken care of.
You may have to pay some back taxes, a big fine... but there will be no prison.
Okay.
So what's your problem, Alex?
I'll show you my problem.
I've heard about financial...
support the government receives...
from the drug industry in Bolivia.
Well, the irony of this is that this money...
which is in the billions...
is coming from your country.
You are the major purchaser of our national product...
which is cocaine.
You're saying the U.S. Government...
is spending millions to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets.
At the same time...
we are doing business with the same government...
that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
Let me show you a few of the other characters...
that are involved in this tragic comedy.
My organization just recently traced a large purchase by this man.
This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.
He is the Minister of the Defense of Bolivia, my country.
And General Cucombre just a couple months ago...
bought a $12 million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister...
what is he doing living in Switzerland?
Guarding cash registers?
This man here, Alejandro Sosa, a very interesting character.
He's a wealthy landowner...
educated in England, very good family.
But this man is the business brain and drug overlord...
of an empire that stretches across the Andes.
He's not your ordinary drug dealer.
Well, discussing it openly...
He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.
It's embarrassing, Tony.
That is our problem.
You remember Alberto, don't you?
How could I forget him?
Alberto is an expert in the disposal business.
He's going to help us fix our problem.
But he doesn't speak English.
He doesn't know his way around the States too well.
He needs a little help.
Is that a problem, Tony?
No problem.
Good.
So what's the big mystery with the Bolivian situation?
You gonna tell me what happened with Sosa, or what?
A lot of bullshit, that's what happened.
Politics.
I want you to stay down here for a while.
Run things for me.
I gotta go to New York next week.
Fuck this, man.
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.
You don't like it?
You got me into this mess in the first place.
With that fucking Seidelbaum, that right?
With Seidelbaum?
What does Seidelbaum have to do with Sosa?
How do you connect those two?
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?
I'm not hungry.
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.
Do you even know that Sheffield said he can get you a postponement?
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?
Eating, drinking... fucking, sucking...
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?
Then what?
Tell me. Then what?
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.
You got tits, you need a bra.
They got hair on them.
You got a liver, and they got spots on it... and you're eating this fucking shit... and you're looking like these rich fucking mummies in here.
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.
This what I work for? Tell me.
Look at that.
A junkie.
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.
Sleeps all day with them black shades on.
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.
I can't even have a kid with her.
Her womb is so polluted...
I can't even have a fucking little baby with her!
You son of a bitch!
You fuck!
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!
What makes you so much better than me?
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.
Real contribution to human history.
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?
Tell the world.
What kind of a father would you make?
Gonna drive him to school in the mornings?
Are you even gonna be alive by the time the kid goes to school?
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...
Do we ever go anywhere without having 600 thugs... hanging around all the time?
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.
What kind of life is that?
Can't you see... what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.
We're not winners, we're losers.
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.
I'm not going home with you.
I'm not going home with anybody.
I'm going home alone.
I'm leaving you.
I don't need this shit anymore.
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.
Let her go.
Another Quaalude, she gonna love me again.
What're you looking at?
You're all a bunch of fucking assholes.
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.
You need people like me.
You need people like me... so you can point your fucking fingers... and say, "That's the bad guy."
So... what does that make you?
Good?
You're not good.
You just know how to hide... how to lie.
Me, I don't have that problem.
Me, I always tell the truth.
Even when I lie.
So say good night to the bad guy!
Come on.
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again... let me tell you.
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.
There's a bad guy coming through!
Better get out of his way!
NEW YORK CITY
No. You tell Sheffield to keep his nose out of it.
There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.
Just tell him to stay out of it!
Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?
Yeah, all right.
Tony, everything go okay?
Yeah, everything is roses.
Ernie, what time do you got?
- Ten to.
- Ten to.
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.
Sit down.
You don't tell me what to do here!
He's coming out.
He's coming.
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.
We do it in front of the United Nations.
That's how they want it.
I don't care where you blow him up.
Tell me when, okay?
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.
I want you to stay thirty meters behind the car, okay?
Thirty meters. No more.
I heard you the first time.
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.
I told you thirty meters.
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.
Look. Here he comes.
Where's he going?
What's he doing that way?
What the fuck he doing?
What the fuck is that? Come here.
You said she took the kids in the other car!
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!
Forget it!
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.
No way. If Sosa says we do it now, we do it now. Let's go.
This fucking guy.
Okay, just stay behind him.
Slowly, slowly.
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.
Okay. Easy.
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.
This is so fucking bad.
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!
I see them, all right? I see them!
Ten meters, ten meters!
Move it. Move it!
Shut the fuck up, okay?
You don't have the guts to look them in the eye when you kill them.
You gotta hide with that shit...
Shut your mouth.
He's getting up. Let's do it.
Make you feel good?
Make you feel good to kill a mama and her kids. Make you feel big.
Shut your mouth!
Like you, big man! Fuck you!
What do you think I am?
You think I kill two kids and a woman?
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!
You die, motherfucker!
What do you think I am?
You think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!
I told you, no fucking kids!
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.
Nick, where the fuck you been?
On a delivery?
Where the hell is Manny?
I been calling all over.
Where is he?
I don't know, Tony.
He's been gone the last couple of days.
He didn't say nothing.
He's gone? Where?
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?
You can't trust nobody anymore!
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.
He didn't say nothing.
He took off?
Are you all right?
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!
When I get back there...
I'll kick some ass all over the place!
When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!
This fucking cocksucker.
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.
Gone? Where?
She got to see you right away.
Tell her I'll call her tonight.
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?
No.
No.
Okay, listen to me.
If she calls, just tell her I love her.
Okay? Just tell her that.
You hear from Manny?
No.
Your mama called, she gotta see you.
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.
They told me.
Okay. I'm coming over.
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.
Put it on the speaker.
What happened, Tony?
Alex, how you doing?
What happened?
We had some problems.
Alex?
Tony, what happened?
We had a little problem.
I heard.
How you hear that?
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.
He was not supposed to give that speech.
Well, your guy, Alberto, he's a piece of shit.
I told him to do something, he didn't listen... so I cancelled his contract.
My partners and I are pissed off.
That's okay. No big deal.
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.
No, Tony, you can't do that.
They found what was under the car.
Now our friend has got security up the ass.
The heat will come down hard on my partners and me.
There's not gonna be a next time...
- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.
I told you a long time ago, you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
You want to fuck with...
Who the fuck you think I am, your fucking bellboy?
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?
Alex, you there? Hey!
He's not there. Cálmate, man.
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.
One night, I follow her in a taxi.
She goes to a fancy house in Coconut Grove.
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?
I don't know.
There was this car in the driveway.
I know if I go there, she'll kill me.
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?
400 something...
Citrus Drive.
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.
She says to me, "Mira, shut up!
"Mind your own business."
Exactly like you do to me.
Ever since you came back, she's been getting this way.
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?
Why do you have to destroy... everything that comes your way?
409 Citrus Drive.
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.
Jesus, Tony.
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.
Go get Gina.
No!
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!
God!
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Gina.
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.
- You got her?
- I got her.
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.
She's cooling down. Right?
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.
What are we gonna do now?
Do?
We're going to war.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eat that Sosa for breakfast!
Close that fucker down.
Tony, take it easy.
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.
Come on.
This cocksucker's gonna run all over you.
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.
We gotta get organized here.
Fuck! Manny.
How the fuck I do that?
How the fuck I do that, Manny?
Manolo.
Is this what you want, Tony?
You can't stand for another man to be touching me.
So you want me, Tony?
What are you talking about?
Is that it?
Here I am, Tony.
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?
I'm all yours now.
You better come and get me now.
Come on.
Come and get me.
Come and get me.
You do it now before it's too late.
Come on, Tony.
Fuck me.
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!
Die!
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.
Please talk to me.
Don't be mad at me.
Please. Gina, come on.
I love Manny, you know?
I love him.
And I love you, too, you know?
Give me a smile.
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!
Please! Tony!
Let me in, boss! Please!
Tony, open the fucking door!
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.
You wait for me. I'm coming back.
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?
You're fucking with the best!
You want to fuck with me?
You cockroaches.
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.
You wanna play rough?
Say hello to my little friend!
You want to play rough?
There! You like that?
You want more?
You whores!
Cowards!
Want to fuck with me?
Go ahead!
Come on!
How do you like that?
You fucking maricón!
You think you can take me?
You need a fucking army if you gonna take me!
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!
You fuck with me, you fucking with the best!
I'm still standing.
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!
You think you kill me with bullets?
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

Thank you, sir
I wish you had stayed on to take your degree
I couldn't afford to
But don't give up your writing
I remember your stories in the college magazine about village life
They were very good. You know, one can earn a living by writing

Good morning. Sit down
What use will that be?
It will rest your legs
I haven't come up to rest my legs
You know very well why I'm here
I'm going to ask a straight question, and I'd like a straight answer
- What is the date?
- The tenth
- How many months rent do you owe me?
- Three
That makes twenty-one rupees
Will you pay me now, or shall I return this evening?
That makes three questions, not one
It's not fair
Many things are not fair
Is it fair that I should house you for nothing?
That you should use electricity all day without paying for it?
You have had education.
You have pictures of great men on the wall
Is it fair that you don't pay the rent?
It's a sign of greatness, you know
I, too, could turn a pretty phrase...
...but it would not be fit for your young ears
Anyway, either I get my money this evening...
...or I'll look for a new lodger
This letter is for you, not me
We're both Rays
We are pleased to accept your short story "A Man of the Soil"...
...for publication in the next
ssue of Sahityik
Not bad news, I hope
Why do you get so few letters?
Does nobody write to you?
I'd like to open a love letter by mistake
Perhaps it's as well
I've experienced matrimonial complications
HARIMATI PRIMARY SCHOOL
You advertised for a teacher
Qualifications?
- Intermediate Science
- No good, we want Matriculation
But I got that before Intermediate
What did the advertisement say?
It did specify Matriculation
Then why harp on Intermediate?
What's the point?
Would you work for ten rupees a month?
Well?
I understand you want someone in your factory.
I have Matriculation
Any experience of labelling?
Labelling?
No, but I can learn
Go through that door and down the passage.
Take a look first
Pulu!
You're a fine friend.
Why didn't you tell me you'd left the student hostel?
I've been searching north Calcutta for you since four o'clock
I finally got your address from the people you give private lessons to
What's so funny?
You've put on weight
I had.
I lost it these last three hours
Would you like tea at the cafe around the corner?
All right.
But I've two tickets for us to see Sadhabar Ekadashi
Is this a hideout? Are you forging banknotes or something?
I wish I could
And you cook for yourself?
I'll cook you a meal one day:
Rice and potatoes
What about the railway job?
I thought you'd got it
There was a strike on, and they wanted people as strike-breakers
So you've been unemployed?
I give some private lessons
- How much do you make?
- Fifteen rupees a month
Didn't you learn to type?
Yes, I thought it might be useful
Good. I'll get you a job as soon as we return
Where are we going?
You'll come with me to my cousin
Aparna's wedding on Monday
- Where?
- Just for a few days
- But where?
- Khulna.
Khulna!
It's a hundred miles away
You'll love it there
An old-world village, a lovely river with boats on it
Fields of grass and paddy.
Bamboo groves, mango orchards
Doesn't it tempt you?
Trees full of birds:
Magpies, thrushes, nightingales
And in the evening, fireflies and oil lamps aglow
No electricity
Doesn't it sound tempting?
You'll come, won't you?
Take me back to thy lap,
O Mother Earth
Take back thy son and wrap him
n thine ample robe
Let me be one with the soil, and spread myself
Far and wide, like the joys of spring, let me burst the heart's narrow cage reak down the stonewalls of self and the cheerless prison of the mind
To rush forth in a rapture of delight
And flow to the far ends of the earth, surging, billowing, rolling on
A policeman
Who's there?
Am Mainaak, son of the Himalayas, hiding my wings in the sea
What's come over you?
You sound as if you've had too much to drink
I don't think I'll take that job
Don't be absurd
Why should I become a clerk?
There is no reason why I should
I'm a free man, without ties, no one to worry about
Why should I become a clerk?
But you can't keep pawning books to pay the rent
- Things will change
- Not without a job
Listen, those with real talent...
Needn't eat?
Apurba Kumar Ray
Make fun of me, but just wait and see
Something up your sleeve?
Some new poems?
You're too prosaic
You'll go abroad, become an engineer, get a fat job and settle down
So I'm prosaic? That's gratitude!
Who took you in hand in Calcutta?
Country bumpkin scared of the traffic
Who read your first short story, and what did he say about it?
Don't get so worked up
Do you know why I feel so elated?
I've had my first good meal for months, thanks to you
Well, are you writing anything?
A wonderful novel
Why didn't you tell me?
- Do you know a good publisher?
- No problem
A boy
A village boy.
Poor, but sensitive
Father, a priest. He dies
The boy doesn't want to be a priest.
He wants to study, he's ambitious
He studies
In the process, I see him struggle
He sheds superstition and prejudice
He takes nothing on trust
He tries to be rational
He has imagination, he's intrigued by little things
He has greatness in him, perhaps.
He has the ability to create
But he doesn't
Right, but that's not a tragedy
He remains poor, in want
But he doesn't turn from life, he doesn't want to escape
He is fulfilled, he wants to live
This is autobiography
Partly, but there are imaginary characters, plot, love...
Love?
What do you know of love?
You've never been within ten paces of a girl
It's not that easy, you have no experience
- Is imagination worth nothing?
- Not where love is concerned
- You're quite wrong
- I'm absolutely right
How much further wilt thou lead me,
O Fair One?
Tell me what shore thy golden boat will touch
Whatever I ask thee, O thou from distant lands
Thou smilest in thine own sweet way
And I can never know what is in thy mind
Silently, thou liftest a finger pointing to the trackless, wild sea
As, far to the west, the sun goes down in the sky
What lies there?
What do we go to seek?
Tell me, I pray thee,
O stranger fair
Where, at the edge of evening, glows the day...
Give me your hand
Wonderful. Really wonderful
Look who is here!
It's Pulu, and not alone
I hope the journey was not too unpleasant for city people
My youngest son, Murari.
He's studying at Daulatpur College
Take his luggage
My aunt
It's a pity you didn't think of him as a possible son-in-law
Where have I seen him before?
Impossible. He's never been here
But I know his face so well
Yes, I saw a picture of Lord Krishna looking just like him
Lord Krishna...
...complete with his flute
Binu, my son, come out now
What's wrong? Isn't he well?
It's nothing. The sun was so hot
The long journey and the fasting must have upset him
Bring water, and a fan
This is a fine wedding
That boy is insane
Who says so? He is perfectly sane.
The journey and the heat...
If you don't stop the wedding, I will
But the auspicious hour is passing
Leave this room!
It's you who is mad
When the hour has passed, my daughter will never marry
Isn't there another auspicious hour, at ten?
Don't ask me. This means ruin for me
Have I missed the ceremony?
There's no wedding
The bridegroom is mad
Apu, everything depends on you now
Are you joking?
What is all this?
If the wedding does not take place at the auspicious times...
...the bride is cursed
But what can I do?
We have to find another husband for her and you are the obvious choice
You want me to be a substitute bridegroom?
Is this a play or a novel?
What do you take me for?
Are you still living in the Dark Ages?
Calm down and listen to me
No, I won't listen to a pack of lunatics
Everything depends on you
It's no use, let's go
Come here a moment
Can you really get me that job?
You'll have to lend me a shirt, and I must have a shave
Your daughter didn't worship Shiva in vain.
A curse became a blessing
The moment I saw him,
I knew he was nearer to me than my own kin
Pulu has brought many of his friends here...
...but I've never felt so drawn to anyone
There are a few things that I must tell you
I've had no opportunity before
How much do you know about me?
Has Pulu told you anything?
Yes
What did he say?
You're an orphan
Yes.
I lost my father when I was ten
Mother died seven years later
I had a sister, too
What else did he tell you?
You write well
He told you that, did he?
Can you read?
Yes. Bengali
I'm writing my novel in Bengali
I know
What else did he say?
Nothing else
That's not very much
You know little of the man you married
I have no means, no job...
...and almost no future
What kind of home shall I take you to?
You've been brought up in these surroundings
A spacious house, servants, fine rooms
This marriage was forced on me.
I was against it, but...
Something changed my mind,
I felt I would be doing a noble thing
Everything became confused
Why don't you say something?
I can't decide until I know your mind
Aparna, will you be able to endure poverty?
Can you live with a poor husband?
Yes
Can you really?
Why not?
Then I'll take you with me.
If your father objects,
I'll ignore him
- Will you object?
- I don't know
- I wonder what they'll say
- Who?
My neighbours.
I went to a wedding, but I shall return with the bride
I'll come back for the luggage
This is my room
Sit down. I won't be long
You must be very sad
Really not?
They want to see us downstairs
Make way. Let's see the bride
What a lovely bride!
Why gawp? Am I new?
Only after meals. You promised
Do you lament your decision?
What?
I don't know such difficult words
Will "regret" do?
Yes
- Do you regret it?
- Regret what?
- Do I have to explain that too?
- Yes
You missed out on a rich husband
- You're laughing!
- No, I'm crying
You must feel sorry
Of course.
I could have had an easy life
- I'm going.
- Where?
To look for a maid servant
Don't be silly. Come back, please
Who will pay for the servant?
I'll get more private lessons
Then send me back to my parents
One lesson is bad enough after a hard day's work
What should I do, then?
I'll tell you:
Give up the lesson you have
And then what?
Then my poor husband will come home early
Then I shall lament no more
God of Fire!
Destroy his meditation!
Are you cross with me?
Yes. Why do we always take a cab?
Buses are crowded. We're alone here
But it costs much more
Does it matter?
Soon you're going to your parents, my expenses will be halved
Only for two months
Isn't that a long time?
What about the extra expenses when we come back?
Ah, yes...
I wouldn't have let you go, but your mother was so insistent
And I felt you'd rather be with her at such a time
A relief for you, too.
No one to bother you for two months
One job will be done
I'll have time to work on my novel.
I haven't touched it since we married
Is that my fault?
No, it's your virtue. You know how much my novel means to me, don't you?
- Well, you mean much more
- Really?
I shall dedicate it to you
You'll what?
I know what "wife" means
You don't. I do
I do, too
- What?
- The matches
What is there in your eyes?
Kohl
We'll expect you in the holidays
I'll do my best. Send a telegram when you arrive; letters take so long
- Promise you'll come
- Haven't I given my word?
You must write twice a week
- You must write, too
- Not unless you do
Write to my office address, or Mr. Ray will open your letters
I had so many things to tell you
Yes, I asked Pintu's mother to make you some cakes
There's a bill to pay at the grocer's
I've left some jewellery behind
Please take care of yourself
You'll see her in a week, so cheer up
I wish I knew your secret
How to be married and happy on forty-five rupees a month
How do you know I'm happy?
I can guess
I don't know what your wife is like, but mine...
I like them to be a little pert...
...a little saucy, a little naughty
It adds spice to a marriage, don't you think?
My wife is just the opposite
Never quarrels, never complains, never answers back...
...always meek and obedient
Utterly bland, tasteless
Plus this
You've promised to come on the 8th
f you don't, I'll never speak to you again, never, ever
You should have sent me eight letters last month...
...and I only got seven
should never trust you
And I feel jealous of that girl next door
She sees you morning and evening, and I don't
Do keep the window shut
What else is there to tell?
The more I write, the more you will laugh at my mistakes ut I don't care.
You are the writer, not me
Please take good care of yourself
am well, but my heart is sick.
T will heal when you come
f you don't, I'll never speak to you again, never, ever
What is it?
Aparna...
In childbirth...
She said: "I'm leaving him in your care, Mrs. Ganguly
"He's so absent-minded, he forgets to eat sometimes"
Such sweet words and such gentle ways
Well, it's a good thing the baby was saved.
Fate works in strange ways
But a young fellow like you shouldn't give up
"While Krishna has his knot of hair and flute there'll be women to serve him"
Why, you could marry ten times over if you wanted
Dear Pulu. You must have heard the news by now
hear you're going abroad.
Wish you success
'm going away, too
don't know where I'm going, ut I do know why:
Want to be free
'm taking my novel with me.
'Ll send it to you if I finish it
You may publish it
f you like it enough.
Yours, Apu
What have you thrown in my food?
I'll teach you a lesson, my lad!
He's bitten me
Wait and see what your grandfather will do
You'll tell grandfather?
Just wait. You need a good hiding
He'll bash you if you do
Who will bash me?
My father. He lives in Calcutta
Father! That's a good one!
We haven't seen his pigtail these last five years
Do fathers have pigtails?
He's not shown up once, even to see his own son
He's sent three money orders.
Perhaps he calls that doing his duty
Where is Apu?
I was dead against the marriage
It was you and your aunt who took my daughter...
Do you know where Apu is?
I'd just like to know
Somewhere in Central India, working in some coal mine, the vagabond
And the boy takes after him
Always running around and getting up to mischief
When your aunt was alive she could manage him, but it's too much for me
Do you know Apu's address?
Whatever is on his letter
Do you think he'll come back?
Not that heartless brute
When did you get back?
I went to my uncle, looking for you
- What are you doing here?
- Working
- Since when?
- About a year
So far from home?
I didn't come here for a job
I arrived here in my wanderings
I had to fill my stomach
- Has it been filled now?
- More or less
How is the novel getting along?
I threw it away
Why throw it away?
What's the use?
Come along
Are you going to stay here?
- I'm thinking of going away
- Where?
Anywhere. Perhaps abroad.
I'm saving up
Going alone?
- Who else is there?
- Kajal
Your son
So that's what they called him
- Go back home
- Why?
The boy needs someone to look after him
There's such a thing as a father's duty, or did you throw duty away, too?
Who says I don't do my duty?
I've sent money
- Is that all you can do?
- I can't do any more
Don't you love your son?
No
How can I love him?
I've never seen him, to me he is unreal, untrue
For me he doesn't exist
You must have lost your senses
Anyway, I've done my duty.
The rest is up to you
Come here for a moment
My train leaves at seven
Come here
Please do something for the boy, put him in a home or something
- Do that yourself
- No, I can't
- It's not possible for me
- I can't understand why not
There is something which I can't forget
Because Kajal exists...
Aparna does not
I've sent money and I'll send more if necessary
More than that, I cannot do
I have no love for him.
He is like a stranger
If you think he is not being looked after...
...make some arrangement for him
Shall I give you money now?
I've no time. I have to start a new job on Monday
Who is it?
Who do you want?
I'm Apurba
Have you come to fetch him?
I've arranged to leave him with friends in my home village
I'm going away
He's upstairs
He's been feverish, but he's better now
I'm your father
What are you doing?
You might have killed the boy
Won't you make friends with me?
I know lots of good stories
Ghost stories, stories about demons...
...kings, queens, princes and winged horses
Want to hear them?
I'll leave this jewellery with you...
...in case you want to send him to boarding school
It seems to be the only way to be relieved of his burden
Can't you take him with you by force?
As his father you have the right to do that
No, I couldn't do that
I knew it. I knew all along that you could do nothing
What do you want to say, Kajal?
Where are you going?
Will you come with me?
Are you going to Calcutta?
If I did, would you come with me?
Would you take me to my father?
Certainly
Will he be cross with me?
Why should he be?
He'll never leave me?
Never
Who are you?
I'm your friend
Will you come with me?
Grandpa will be angry
Grandpa won't know, I won't tell him
I believe in America.
America has made my fortune.
And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.
I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family.
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.
Two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend.
They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.
She resisted, she kept her honor.
So they beat her like an animal.
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered, held together by wire.
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.
But I wept. Why did I weep?
She was the light of my life.
Beautiful girl.
Now she will never be beautiful again.
Sorry.
I went to the police, like a good American.
These two boys were brought to trial.
The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, but suspended the sentence.
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.
Then I said to my wife, " For justice, we must go to Don Corleone. "
VITO: Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?
What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.
What is that?
(WHISPERING) I want them dead.
That I cannot do.
I'll give you anything you ask.
I've known you many years, but this is the first time you've asked for help.
I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of coffee.
Even though my wife is godmother to your only child.
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.
And you were afraid to be in my debt.
BONASERA: I didn't want to get into trouble.
I understand.
You found Paradise in America.
You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law.
You didn't need a friend like me.
But now you come to me and say,
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "
But you don't ask with respect.
You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.
You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money.
BONASERA: I ask you for justice.
That is notjustice.
Your daughter is alive.
Let them suffer , then, as she suffers.
How much shall I pay you?
Bonasera, Bonasera.
What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?
If you'd come in friendship, the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.
And if an honest man like you should make enemies, they'd be my enemies.
And then they would fear you.
Be my friend?
Godfather?
Good.
Some day, and that day may never come, I'll ask a service of you.
But until that day accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.
 -Gràzie, Godfather.
-Prego.
Give this to Clemenza.
I want people that aren't going to get carried away.
We're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker says.

-Where's Michael?
-Don't worry, he'll be here.
We're not taking the picture without Michael.
-What's the matter?
-It's Michael.
VITO: Don Barzini.
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.
Paulie! More wine.
-You look terrific on the floor.
-Are you a dance judge or something?
Take a walk and do your job.
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.
You watch yourself, all right?
20 , 30 grand. In small bills, cash.
In that little silk purse.
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!
Hey, Paulie!
I got two gabagool, capocol, and a prosciut.
PAULI E: Stupid jerk!
What's the matter?
-Have to go back to work.
-Tom.
No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day.
Don Corleone,  honored and grateful that you have invited me.
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.
SONNY: Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!
Come here, come here, come here!
...but towards the end, he was paroled to help with the American war effort, so for six months he's worked in my pastry shop.
Nazorine, what can I do for you?
Now that the war is over , this boy, Enzo, they want to repatriate him back to Italy.
Godfather , I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...
You want Enzo to stay in this country, and your daughter to be married.
NAZORINE: You understand everything.
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!
The bride, the groom and the angel...
-Who should I give this job to?
-Not to our paisan.
Give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list?
Hey, Michael!
TOM : He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
Is this necessary?
He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
Don Corleone,  honored and grateful that you have invited me on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.
Michael...
That man over there is talking to himself.
See that scary guy over there?
-He's a very scary guy.
-What's his name?
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.
Michael, he's coming over here!
You look terrific!
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.
Your father's been asking for you.
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
Why does your brother have a different name?
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen in the street.
He had no home, so my father took him in.
He's been with us ever since.
He's a good lawyer.
Not a Sicilian. I think he's going to be consigliere.
-What's that?
-That's a, like a counselor , an advisor.
Very important for the family.
You like your lasagna?
Don Corleone. honored and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding.
On the day of your daughter's wedding.
And I hope that their first child will be a masculine child.
I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.
-For your daughter's bridal purse.
-Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.
Don Corleone,  going to leave you now, because I know you're busy.
Thank you.
Signora Corleone!
No!

Senator Cauley apologized for not coming, but said you'd understand.
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.
What is that outside?
Johnny! Johnny!
I love you!
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!
-He's probably in trouble again.
-He's a good godson.
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!
You never said you knew Johnny Fontane!
-Sure. You want to meet him?
-Great! Sure.
-My father helped him with his career.
-He did?
How?
(JOHNNY SINGING
I HAVE BUT ONE HEART)
-Let's listen to this song.
-Michael...
Please, Michael. Tell me.
When Johnny was starting out, he was signed to a personal service contract with a big bandleader.
And as his career got better and better , he wanted to get out of it.
Johnny is my father's godson.
My father went to see this bandleader.
He offered him $ 10 ,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no.
So the next day my father went to see him, but this time with Luca Brasi.
Within an hour , he signed a release for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.
-How did he do that?
-Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and father said that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.
That's a true story.
(SINGING IN ITALIAN)
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.
MAMA CORLEONE: Beautiful!
I'll take care of it.
Tom...
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.
How are you, Fredo?
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.
-Hi.
-How are you doing?
-This is my brother Mike.
-Are you having a good time?
Yeah. This is your friend?
JOHNNY: I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top again.
But this...man won't give it to me, the head of the studio.
-What's his name?
-Woltz.
He won't give it to me, and he says there's no chance.
TOM : Sonny?
Sonny?
TOM : Sonny?
-Sonny, are you in there?
-What?
The old man wants you.
One minute.
JOHNNY: A month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best -seller.
The main character is a guy just like me.
I wouldn't even have to act.
Godfather , I don't know what to do.
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood finocchio that cries like a woman?
(M I M ICKING JOHNNY) "What can I do?
What can I do?" What is that nonsense?
Ridiculous.
-You spend time with your family?
-Sure I do.
Good.
Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.
You look terrible. I want you to eat.
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood big shot will give you what you want.
It's too late, they start shooting in a week. going to make him an offer he can't refuse.
Just go outside and enjoy yourself, and forget about all this nonsense.
-I want you to leave it all to me.
-All right.
-What time does my daughter leave?
-Soon, after they cut the cake.
Do we give your son -in -law something important?
Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the family business with him.
-What else?
-Virgil Sollozzo called.
-We'll have to see him next week.
-When you come back from California.
-When am I going to California?
-Tonight.
I want you to talk to this movie big shot and settle this business for Johnny.
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding.
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.
M ICHAEL: Wait a minute.
KAY: No, Michael. Not me.
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!
MAN: You need a little more heat on that arc.
Start talking.
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.
This friend would give his friendship to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.
Give Johnny the part in that war film you're starting next week.
And what favor would your friend grant Mr. Woltz?
He could make your future union problems disappear.
And one of your stars has just moved from marijuana to heroin.
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!
Let me lay it on the line.
Johnny Fontane will never get that movie!
No matter how many Dago Guinea greaseballs come out of the woodwork!
- German -Irish.
-Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.
- going to make trouble for you!
- a lawyer. I haven't threatened...
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.
I'll wait for your call.
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.
Check him out.
-It's really beautiful.
-Look at this.
-It used to decorate a king's palace.
-Very nice.
WOLTZ: Why didn't you say you work for Corleone?
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.
-I only use his name when necessary.
-WOLTZ: How's your drink?
-Fine.
-Now I'll show you something beautiful.
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?
There you are. $600 ,000 on four hoofs.
I bet Russian czars never paid that for a single horse.
Khartoum.
Khartoum. not going to race him, though. going to put him out to stud.
Thanks, Tony.
Let's get something to eat.
TOM : Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship.
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.
This favor I can't give him.
He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star. going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her , to make her a big star.
Let me be even more frank.
To show you that  not a hard -hearted man. That it's not all dollars and cents.
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had and I've had them all over the world.
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
And she runs off.
She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous!
And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!
You get the hell out of here!
If that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him  no bandleader.
Yeah, I heard that story.
Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening.
Maybe your car can take me to the airport.
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately.
-You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
-No, I slept on the plane.
I have the Sollozzo notes here.
Now...
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
He's supposed to be very good with a knife,
but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint.
His business is narcotics.
He has fields in Turkey, where they grow poppy.
In Sicily he has plants to process them into heroin.
He needs cash, he needs protection from the police.
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.
-What about his prison record?
-One term in Italy, one here.
He's known as a top narcotics man.
-Santino, what do you think?
-A lot of money in that white powder.
Tom?
TOM: Yes. There's more money in narcotics than anything else.
If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families.
With that money they can buy more police and political power.
Then they come after us.
Now we have unions and gambling, and that's great¤, but narcotics is the future.
If we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in 10 years' time.
So? What's your answer going to be, Pop?
Don Corleone.
I need a man who has powerful friends.
I need a million dollars in cash.
I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.
-What is the interest for my family?
In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars.
And then it would go up.
And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?
My compliments.
I'll take care of them, out of my share.
So I receive 30% for finance, political influence and legal protection?
That's right.
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?
If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance, te salud, Don Corleone.
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man, to be treated with respect.
But, I must say no to you.
And I'll give you my reason.
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was involved in drugs instead of gambling, which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business.
It doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living.
But your business is...a little dangerous.
If you're worried about security, the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
-The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
-Wait a minute.
I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them.
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to congratulate you on your new business.
I know you'll do well, and good luck.
Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
Santino.
Come here.
What's the matter with you?
Your brain is going soft from playing with that girl.
Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.
Go on.
Tom, what's this nonsense?
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.
-Take it away.
-Take it over there.
And tell Luca Brasi to come in. a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow.
Find out what he's got under his fingernails.
Go to the Tattaglias.
Make them think that you're not too happy with our family and find out what you can.
I got something for your mother and for Sonny and a tie for Freddy, and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
-What do you want for Christmas?
-Just you.
(HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE
CHRISTMAS PLAYING ON RADIO)
VITO: Andiamo, Fredo.
-Tell Paulie to get the car.
-Okay, Pop.
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.
Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.
-Luca!  Bruno Tattaglia.
-I know.
You know who I am?
(IN ITALIAN) I know you.
(IN ITALIAN) You have been talking to the Tattaglia family...right?
I think you and I can do business.
I need someone strong like you.
I heard you are not happy...
...with the Corleone family.
Want to join me?
What's in it for me?
$50 ,000 to start with.
Not bad!
Agreed?
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
-Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
-I haven't got time.
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.
What are you worried about? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
Get in.
-Fredo,  going to buy some fruit.
-Okay, Pop.
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
Would you like me better if I were a nun? Like in the story.
No.
-What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
-Now, that's a thought.
Michael.
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
What's the matter?
They don't say if he's dead or alive.
-Sonny, it's Michael.
-Where have you been?
-Is he all right?
-We don't know yet.
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.
 -Are you there?
-Yeah,  here.
 -Where have you been? I was worried.
-Didn't Tom tell you I called?
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?
SANDRA: Oh, my God.
Sonny!
Stay back there.
-Who is it?
-Open up, it's Clemenza.
There's more news about your old man.
Word is out that he's already dead.
-What's the matter with you?
-Take it easy!
-Where was Paulie?
-Sick. He's been sick all winter.
-How often?
-Only three, four times.
-Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
-Pick him up now.
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him to my father's house right now.
-You want anyone sent over here?
-No. Go ahead. going to have a couple of our people come over to the house.
-Hello?
-SOLLOZZO: Santino Corleone?
-Yeah.
-We have Tom Hagen.
In three hours he'll be released with our proposition.
Listen to what he has to say before you do anything.
What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of yours, Sonny.
I'll wait.
(HANGS UP)
SOLLOZZO: Your boss is dead.
I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared.
I want you to help the Corleones and me.
We got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up.
Drink it.
It's up to you to make peace between me and Sonny.
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?
And you knew it was the right thing to do.
-Sonny will come after you.
-That will be his first reaction, sure.
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.
The other New York families will go along with anything to prevent war.
Let's face it, with all due respect, the Don  - rest in peace  - was slipping.
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back.
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.
It's good business, Tom.
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Yeah, well...
Let me worry about Luca.
You just talk to Sonny.
And the other two kids.
-I'll do my best.
-Good.
Now you can go.
I don't like violence, Tom. a businessman.
Blood is a big expense.
He's still alive.
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.
Your mother is at the hospital with your father. Looks like he'll pull through.
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...
M ICHAEL: You gonna kill all those guys?
Stay out of it.
TOM : If you get rid of Sollozzo, everything falls into line.
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.
-Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
-We've been trying all night.
Hey, do me a favor...
TOM : Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?
If we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength.
The other New York families might support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
This is almost 1 946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
If your father dies you make the deal.
-Easy to say. He's not your father.
- as much a son as you or Mike.
What is it?
-Paulie, I told you to stay put.
-The guy at the gates has a package.
Tessio, go see what it is.
-Shall I stay?
-SONNY: Yeah. Are you all right?
- fine.
-There's food. Are you hungry?
-No.
-A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
-Go ahead.
-That might be a good idea.
Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.
-Make that the first thing on your list.
-Understood.
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to Luca's apartment.
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.
Hanging around the house on the phone would be a big help.
Try Luca again.
-What's this?
-TESSIO: A Sicilian message.
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
- going.
-When will you be home?
Probably late.
-Don't forget the cannoli!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear -view mirror.
Sonny's running wild. He wants to go to mattresses already.
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
-Know a good spot on the West Side?
-I'll think about it.
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.
Watch the kids.
ROCCO: Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up 1 8 mattresses and bring me the bill.
PAULI E: Yeah, all right.
ROCCO: Make sure they're clean, because the guys will be there a long time.
PAULI E: They're clean and exterminated.
ROCCO: (CHUCKLING)
That's a bad word to use.
Exterminate! Watch out, so we don't exterminate you!
ROCCO: Pull over.
I've got to take a leak.
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
CLEMENZA: Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!
-Yeah.
-Phone call!
-Who is it?
-Some girl.
-Hello. Kay?
-KAY: How's your father?
He's going to make it.
I love you.
Huh?
I love you!
 -Michael?
-Yeah, I know.
 -Tell me you love me.
-I can't talk.
Can't you say it?
I'll see you tonight.
Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?
I love you with all my heart. If I don't see you again soon,  going to die!
Come and learn something. You might have to cook for 20 guys some day.
You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic.
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.
You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs.
Add a little bit of wine.
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.
Cut the crap. I have more important things for you. How's Paulie?
You won't see him no more.
-Where are you going?
-To the city.
-Send bodyguards with him.
- going to the hospital...
CLEMENZA: He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.
Send somebody with him anyway.
(ALL OF MY LIFE
PLAYING ON RADIO)
-I have to go.
-Can I go with you?
No, Kay. There will be detectives there, people from the press.
I'll wait in the cab.
I don't want you to get involved.
When will I see you again?
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call you at your parents' house.
-When will I see you again, Michael?
-I don't know.
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.
Michael Corleone. This is my father.
What happened to the guards?
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.
The police made them leave about 10 minutes ago.
Get me Long Beach 45620 , please.
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
Sonny,  at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.
 -Don't panic.
-I won't panic. sorry, but you will have to leave.
We're going to move him to another room.
Can you disconnect the tubes?
-That's out of the question!
-Do you know my father?
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?
Help me, please.
-Who are you?
-I am Enzo, the baker.
-Remember me?
-Enzo.
You'd better go, there's going to be trouble.
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to help you. For your father.
Listen. Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital, all right?
I'll be out in a minute.
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now. with you now. with you.
Get rid of these. Come here.
Put your hand in your pocket, like you have a gun. You'll be all right.
You did good.
I thought all you Guinea hoods were locked up!
-Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
-You little punk!
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.
-Stay away from this hospital!
-Not until my father's room is guarded.
-Phil, take him in!
-The kid's clean, Captain.
-He's a war hero. He's never been...
-I said take him in!
-What's The Turk paying you?
-Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
Stand him up straight. the Corleones' attorney. These men are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
They're licensed to carry firearms.
If you interfere, you'll have to appear before the judge and show cause.
Let him go.
-What's with all the new faces?
-We'll need them now.
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.
Jesus Christ.
Looks like a fortress around here.
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen on the street 24 hours a day.
That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead.
Mike, let me look at you.
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.
-He wants a meeting today.
-What did he say?
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.
He promises that the deal is too good to refuse.
-And Bruno Tattaglia?
-That's part of the deal.
-He cancels out what they did to Father.
-We should listen to them.
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.
No more meetings, discussions, or Sollozzo tricks.
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...
-The other families...
-They hand me Sollozzo!
-They shot my father...
-Even that was business, not personal.
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.
No more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win.
I found out about Captain McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money.
McCluskey has agreed to be The Turk's bodyguard.
So when Sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable.
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain.
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!
Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.
All right, we'll wait.
We can't wait. We can't wait.
No matter what Sollozzo says, he's going to kill Pop.
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.
-Mike is right.
-SONNY: Let me ask you something.
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?
They want to have a meeting with me, right?
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.
Let's set the meeting.
Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.
We insist it's a public place.
A bar , a restaurant.
Some place where there are people, so I feel safe.
They'll search me when I meet them, right?
So I can't have a weapon on me.
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for me then I'll kill them both.
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.
Now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you?
This isn't like the army! You have to get close and get their brains on your suit.
You're taking this very personal.
Tom, this is business and he's taking it personal.
-Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
-Mikey... talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop.
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming.
That's a terrific story. We have newspaper people on the payroll, right?
-They might like a story like that.
-They might.
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.
CLEMENZA: It's as cold as they come.
Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints.
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt. Try it.
Is the trigger too tight?
My ears!
I left it noisy, so it scares away any pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?
-Sit down, finish my dinner.
-Don't fool around.
Let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face, so walk out fast, but don't run.
Don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either.
They'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing.
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where, and we'll catch the hell.
-How bad do you think it will be?
-Pretty goddamn bad.
All the other families will probably line up against us.
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you. Being a hero and all.
Your father too.
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held.
How much time do we have?
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
CLEMENZA: We could put a tail on them.
Sollozzo would lose our ass.
-What about the negotiator?
-He's playing pinochle with my men.
-He's happy. They're letting him win.
-Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
The negotiator plays cards until Mike is back safe.
-He could blast whoever is in the car.
-CLEMENZA: They'll expect that.
Sollozzo might not even be in the car , Sonny!
I'll get it.
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
-Is it reliable?
-My man in McCluskey's precinct.
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.
-Anybody know this joint?
-Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.
They've got an old -fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant, you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.
Then you go to take a leak. No, better still, you ask permission to go.
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.
I want somebody very good to plant that gun.
I don't want him coming out with just his dick.
-The gun will be there.
-You drive him and pick him up.
Let's move.
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?
Yeah, a million times.
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out.
How long do you think it will be before I can come back?
At least a year.
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and...
I'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right.
Take care.
Take care, Mike. glad you came. I hope we can straighten everything out.
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.
I swear on my children that he won't be, Mike.
But you have to keep an open mind when we talk.
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.
McCLUSKEY: He's a good kid. sorry about the other night, Mike.
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.
I guess  getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.
He's clean.
Going to Jersey?
Maybe.
Nice work, Lou.
-How's the food in this restaurant?
-Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
McCLUSKEY: I'll have it.
- going to speak Italian to Mikey.
-Go ahead.
What I want...
What's most important to me is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.
What guarantees can I give you? the hunted one!
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid. not that clever.
All I want is a truce.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?
When you got to go, you got to go.
He's clean.
Don't take too long.
I've frisked a thousand punks.
Okay, you take over.
I love you, Grandpa.
CONNIE:  sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank. "
Go with your mother.
Take them downstairs.
Go on, Carlo, you too.
Go on.
-What's the matter with you, Carlo?
-Shut up and set the table.
Since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations.
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.
They hit us, so we hit them back.
Through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out material about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
So things are loosening up.
And  sending Fredo to Las Vegas, under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.
-I want him to rest.
- going to learn the casino business.
(SOFTLY) Where's Michael?
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
But he's safe. We're starting to work to bring him back.
I want you to find out where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
I want him now.
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell will break loose. Pop can negotiate.
-He must get better first. I'll decide...
-War is costly. We can't do business.
-Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
-We can't afford a stalemate.
-No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
-You're getting a great reputation!
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!
Pop had Genco. Look what I got. sorry. I didn't mean that.
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
Niggers are having a good time with our policy banks in Harlem.
Driving new Cadillacs, paying 50% on a bet.
That's because they've started making big money.
Papa never talked business at the table.
-CARLO: Shut up, Connie...
-Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
Don't interfere.
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...
We don't discuss business at the table.
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
Why are you so far from the house?
You know  responsible to your father for your life.
The bodyguards are here.
It's still dangerous...
We've heard from Santino in New York...
Your enemies know you're here.
Did Santino say when
I can go back?
It's out of the question.
Where are you going now?
To Corleone.
Take my car.
I want to walk.
Be careful.
Michael. Corleone.
Where have all the men gone?
They're all dead from vendettas.
There are the names of the dead.
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable!
America! Take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!
(IN ITALIAN) Mamma mia what a beauty.
I think you got hit by the thunderbolt.
(IN ITALIAN) In Sicily women are more dangerous than shotguns.
Did you have a good hunt?
You know all the girls around here?
We saw some real beauties.
One of them struck our friend like a thunderbolt.
She would tempt the devil himself.
Really put together.
Right, Calo?
Such hair , such mouth!
The girls around here are beautiful...but virtuous.
This one had a purple dress...
And a purple ribbon in her hair.
A type more Greek than Italian.
Do you know her?
There's no girl like that in this town.
My God, I understand!
What's wrong?
Let's go.
It's his daughter.
Tell him to come here.
Call him.
Fabrizio, you translate.
I apologize if I offended you. a stranger in this country.
I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter. an American, hiding in Sicily.
My name is Michael Corleone.
There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information.
But then your daughter would lose a father instead of gaining a husband.
I want to meet your daughter.
With your permission, and under the supervision of your family.
With all respect.
(IN ITALIAN) Come to my house
Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli.
(IN ITALIAN) What's her name?
Apollonia.
SONNY: I'll knock you dizzy.
Save it for the library.
We've got to pick up my sister.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
-It was my fault!
-Where is he?
It was my fault. I hit him.
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me... just going to get a doctor to take a look at you.
Sonny, please don't do anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?
Make that baby an orphan before he's born?
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?
Tell them to stop taking in action.
(COMMENTATOR NARRATING

We lost enough money last week.
Come here, come here!
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.
-I want to reach Michael.
-Nobody knows where he is.
All we know is that he's all right.
-What was that?
-An accident, but nobody was hurt.
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
He'll get in touch with you.
I let my cab go, so can I call another one, please?
Come on. Sorry.
-Hello?
-WOMAN: Is Carlo there?
-Who is this?
-A friend of Carlo.
Tell him that I can't make it tonight until later.

-Dinner's on the table.
- not hungry.
-The food is getting cold.
-I'll eat out later.
-You just told me to make you dinner!

Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?
Maybe I will.
-Clean it up!
-Like hell I will!
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...
Clean it!
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer , like your father!
-All you Corleones are murderers!
-I hate you!
Come on, kill me!
Get out of here!
-I hate you!
-Now I'll kill you.
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.
Yeah, Connie.
You wait there.
No, you just wait there.
Son -of-a -bitch.
-Son -of-a -bitch!
-What's the matter?
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.
Sonny!
-Sonny.
-Get out of here!
Go after him, go on!
Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!
Give me a drop.
My wife is crying upstairs.
I hear cars coming to the house.
Consigliere of mine, tell your Don what everyone seems to know.
I didn't tell Mama anything.
I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.
But you needed a drink first.
Yeah.
Well, now you've had your drink.
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.
I want no inquiries made.
I want no acts of vengeance.
I want you to arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families.
This war stops now.
Call Bonasera.
I need him now.
This is Tom Hagen.  calling for Vito Corleone, at his request.
You owe your Don a service.
He has no doubt that you will repay it.
He will be at your funeral parlor in one hour. Be there to greet him.
Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this service?
Yes. What do you want me to do?
I want you to use all your powers and all your skills.
I don't want his mother to see him this way.
Look how they massacred my boy.
It's safer to teach you English!
I know English...
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.
Greetings, Don Tommasino.
How are things in Palermo?
Michael is teaching me to drive...watch, I'll show you.
How are things in Palermo?
Young people don't respect anything anymore... times are changing for the worse.
This place has become too dangerous for you.
I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa...right now.
What's wrong?
Bad news from America.
Your brother , Santino, they killed him.
Let's go...you promised.
Fabrizio!
(IN ITALIAN) Get the car.
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?
No, take her to her father's house until things are safe.
Okay, anything you say.
(IN ITALIAN) Calo, where is Apollonia?
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.
She'll make a good American wife.
Wait, I'll get the baggage.
Fabrizio!
(IN ITALIAN) Where are you going?
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
No, Apollonia!
VITO: Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting, and the other heads of the five families from New York and New Jersey.
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx, and from Brooklyn
Philip Tattaglia.
And from Staten Island we have with us Victor Strachi.
And the other associates that came as far as from California and Kansas City and all the other territories of the country. Thank you.
How did things ever get so far?
I don't know.
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees, then  willing to let things go on as before.
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.
He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.
He refused to share them.
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?
All of you know me.
When did I ever refuse, except one time? And why?
Because I believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come.
It's not like gambling or liquor or even women, which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the Church.
Even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things are going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.
I believed that then and I believe that now.
Times have changed.
It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted.
A refusal is not the act of a friend.
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share them or let others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well.
Certainly he can present a bill for such services.
After all, we're not communists.
I also don't believe in drugs.
For years I paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business.
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment, we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "
They can't resist. I want to control it as a business, keep it respectable.
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.
That's an infàmia.
In my city we would keep the traffic to the colored.
They're animals, so let them lose their souls.
I hoped that we could come here and reason together.
And  willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution.
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled.
Don Corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace.
I must have strict assurance from Corleone.
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger , will he attempt any individual vendetta?
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.
You talk about vengeance.
Will vengeance bring your son back to you?
Or my boy to me?
I forgo the vengeance of my son.
But I have selfish reasons.
My youngest son was forced to leave this country because of this Sollozzo business.
And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.
Cleared of all these false charges.
But  a superstitious man.
If an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer¤, or if he should hang himself in his jail cell, or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning, then  going to blame some of the people in this room.
And that I do not forgive.
But, that aside let me say that I swear on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records?
Mention it. Don't insist.
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.
Tattaglia's a pimp.
He could never have outfought Santino.
But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along.
Come on, Nancy.
Keep together , everyone. Brian.
Okay, all right.
How long have you been back?
I've been back a year.
Longer than that, I think.
It's good to see you, Kay. working for my father now, Kay.
He's been sick. Very sick.
But you're not like him.
You told me you weren't going to become like your father.
My father is no different than any other powerful man.
Any man who's responsible for other people.
Like a senator or president.
-How naive you sound.
-Why?
They don't have men killed.
Who's being naive, Kay?
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.
In five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.
Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business. Kay...
Michael, why did you come here? Why?
What do you want with me after all this time? I've been calling and writing.
I came because I need you.
I care for you.
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...
I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us.
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that we have each other.
That we have a life together.
That we have children. Our children.
Kay, I need you.
And I love you.
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it!
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-M ICHAEL: Be patient.
TESSIO:  not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.
M ICHAEL: Be patient.
CARLO: We must protect ourselves.
-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...
You once said that one day Tessio and me could form our own family.
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.
Michael is now head of the family.
If he gives his permission, then you have my blessing.
After we make the move to Nevada you can leave the Corleone family and go on your own.
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time there will be nothing left to build on.
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.
Things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions.
That's all I can tell you now.
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
When we make our move there, you'll be my right -hand man.
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
That's no reflection on Tom, just how I want it.
If I ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? That's it.
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.
Mike... Why am I out?
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.
Things may get rough with the move.
Tom.
I advised Michael. I never thought you were a bad consigliere.
I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace.
Michael has all my confidence, just as you do.
But there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen.
-Maybe I could help.
-You're out, Tom.
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.
Let me open the door , all right?
(PLAYING
FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)
-Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
-All for you, kid! It's all his idea.
JOHNNY: Your brother Freddy.
FREDO: Girls?
-Anything you want, kid, anything.
-Who are the girls?
-That's for you to find out.
-Get rid of them, Fredo.
-Hey, Mike...
- here on business. Get rid of them. tired. Get rid of the band too.
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
Hey, come on! Scram!
Come on, honey. I don't know what's the matter with him, Johnny.
Sorry.
I don't know. He's tired.
What happened to Moe Greene?
He had some business. He said to give him a call when the party started.
Well, give him a call.
-Johnny, how are you?
-Nice to see you, Mike.
M ICHAEL: We're proud of you.
JOHNNY: Thanks.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.
Well, I owe it all to him.
He knows how grateful you are.
That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.
Mike, what can I do?
We're thinking of giving up our interests in the olive oil business and settling here.
Moe will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.
-Tom!
-Are you sure?
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
See, Johnny...
We figure that entertainment would draw gamblers to the casino.
We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year.
Perhaps convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same.
We're counting on you.
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.
Good.
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
-Good to see you.
-How are you, Moe?
Have everything? Specially prepared food, the best dancers, and good credit.
Draw chips for everybody, so they can play on the house.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
Buy me out?
The casino, the hotel.
The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out? No, I buy you out.
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.
-You think  skimming off the top?
-You're unlucky.
You Guineas make me laugh.
I took Freddy in when you had a bad time, and now you try to push me out!
You did that because we bankrolled your casino
Yes. First of all, you're all done.
You don't have that kind of muscle anymore.
The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by the others.
Do you think you can come to my hotel and take over?
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel!
Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
He flies off the handle sometimes, but we're good friends.
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.
We had an argument, so I had to straighten him out.
You straightened my brother out?
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.
What's wrong with you?
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.
Son -of-a -bitch!
Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were out with cheerleaders.
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...
Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.
If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
Fredo...
You're my older brother , and I love you.
But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.
Ever.
I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me.
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city, see a show and have dinner.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
-Let her ask.
-She's afraid to.
They want you to be godfather to their boy.
-We'll see.
-Will you?
Let me think about it. Come on.
Barzini will move against you first.
He'll set up a meeting with someone you absolutely trust.
Guaranteeing your safety.
And at that meeting you'll be assassinated.
I like to drink wine more than I used to.
-Anyway,  drinking more.
-It's good for you, Pop.
I don't know.
Are you happy with your wife and children?
-Very happy.
-That's good.
I hope you don't mind the way I keep going over this Barzini business.
-No, not at all.
-It's an old habit.
I spend my life trying not to be careless.
Women and children can be careless, but not men.
-How's your boy?
-He's good.
He looks more like you every day.
He's smarter than I am. He's three and can read the funny papers.
Read the funny papers.
I want you to arrange for a telephone man to check all in - and out -going calls.
-I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
-That's right. I forgot.
What's the matter?
What's bothering you?
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, so I'll handle it.
I knew that Santino would have to go through all this.
And Fredo...
Fredo was, well...
But I never wanted this for you.
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize for taking care of my family.
And I refused to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots.
I don't apologize. That's my life, but I thought that, that when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings.
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.
Another pezzonovante.
Well...
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.
Now listen, whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting, he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
Can I hold it, please?
-Can I water these?
-Yes, go ahead.
Over here, over here.
Be careful. You're spilling it.
Anthony!
Come here, come here.
That's it. We'll put it right there.
I'll show you something. Come here.
Stand there.
Give me an orange!
That's a new trick.
You run in there. Run in there.
ANTHONY: Where are you?
Mike, can I have a minute?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
He says we can straighten out any of our problems.
-You talked to him?
-Yeah.
I can arrange security. On my territory.
-All right?
-All right.
Do you know how they're going to come at you?
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
Where I'll be safe.
I always thought it would be Clemenza, not Tessio.
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.
But  going to wait.
After the baptism.
I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.
(RECITING CONTINUES)
PRI EST: Michael, do you believe in God, the Father ,
Creator of Heaven and Earth?
I do.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?
MICHAEL: I do.
PRIEST: Do you believe in the
Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?
MICHAEL: I do.
(RECITING CONTINUES IN LATIN)
(BABY CRYING)
(RECITING CONTINUES)
PRI EST: Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
WOMAN: Oh, God!
-And all his pomps?
-I do renounce them.
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?
I will.
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may the Lord be with you. Amen.
Kay!
Kiss your godfather.
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.
Everybody has to leave without us.
-CONNIE: Mike, it's our first vacation!
-Connie, please.
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.
I'll only be a couple of days.
We're on our way to Brooklyn.
-I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- sure he will.
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car , so you two go on ahead.
-That screws up my arrangements.
-That's what he said.
I can't go either , Sal.
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.
-He understands that.
-Excuse me, Sal.
Tom, can you get me off the hook?
-For old times' sake?
-Can't do it, Sally.
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.
-Mike, you got it all wrong.
-You fingered Sonny for Barzini.
That little farce you played with my sister.
-You think that could fool a Corleone?
- innocent. I swear on the kids.
-Please, don't do this.
-Sit down.
Don't do this to me, please.
Barzini is dead.
So is Philip Tattaglia.
Moe Greene.
Strachi. Cuneo.
Today I settle all family business, so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
Admit what you did.
Get him a drink.
Come on.
Don't be afraid, Carlo.
Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow? godfather to your son, Carlo.
Go ahead, drink, drink.
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.
You're finished. putting you on a plane to Vegas.
Tom.
I want you to stay there. Understand?
Only don't tell me you're innocent.
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.
Who approached you?
Tattaglia or Barzini?
It was Barzini.
Good.
There's a car waiting outside to take you to the airport.
I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.
-Mike...
-Get out of my sight.
Hello, Carlo.
- trying to tell you...
-CONNIE: Mama, please!
Michael!
KAY: What is it?
CONNIE: Where is he?
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.
You waited until Papa died, so nobody could stop you.
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?
KAY: Connie.
CONNIE: Why do you think he kept Carlo at the Mall?
He knew he was going to kill him.
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold -hearted bastard!
Want to know how many men he had killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
That's your husband, that's your husband!
No! No, no...
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
She's hysterical.
Hysterical.
Michael, is it true?
-Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
-Is it true?
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!
All right.
This one time.
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.
Is it true?
Is it?
No.
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.
Don Corleone.

The film studios Mosfilm and ICAIC thank the insurgent army, the people's militia, the Cuban Ministry of Interior Affairs and Academy of Sciences, and also those who gave help in the creation of this film.
I am Cuba.
Once, Christopher Columbus landed here.
He wrote in his diary:
''This is the most beautiful land ever seen by human eyes.''
Thank you, Senor Columbus.
When you saw me for the first time,
I was singing and laughing.
I waved the fronds of my palms to greet your sails.
I thought your ships brought happiness.
I am Cuba.
Ships took my sugar and left me tears.
Strange thing, sugar,
Senor Columbus.
It contains so many tears, but it is sweet.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment of truth.
The voting depends on you!
We ask that you give a big hand to our beauties.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Louder.
Another big hand.
Louder, louder!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Crazy love.
Crazy love.
This crazy love in my blood.
She loves me.
I can't live anymore without your love.
Crazy love.
This crazy love, the love of my life.
I can't live anymore without your love.
It's crazy love that my heart feels for you.
Take, take all my love, my sweet little love.
I can't live anymore without your love.
Crazy love.
I am, I am love-crazy, crazy.
I am crazy for your love.
Crazy love.
Love crazy.
Crazy is the love
I feel for you.
Crazy, crazy, crazy for your love.
Crazy, crazy for your love.
Bob, that's indecent.
Ah, nuts!
Nothing's indecent in Cuba if you've got the dough!
- Good morning, Rene.
- How are you, senora?
So-so. This heat.
Oranges, white pineapples.
California plums, nice juicy pears, cheap.
How's business, Rene?
- Fine, fine. How are you doing?
-You've come to keep him company?
Got any fruit for me?
I do, the best.
You see, this is what
I was telling you about.
I think I'm going to become a fruit seller too.
- Well, see you later.
- Okay, man, see you.
- Who was that?
- Regular customers.
I'm afraid, Rene.
You don't have to be afraid of anything.
Look.
Look. We're going to be married in that church.
And you'll be wearing a white dress.
A white dress.
You've never kissed anyone, have you?
Listen, I'll bring you fruit every day at your job.
How come you don't tell me where you work?
Too bad I don't sell flowers.
I would give all my flowers to you.
I love you, Maria.
Fellows, I'd like you to meet Betty.
Look at that, she brings her own tangerine.
Interesting.
No, it's not interesting, senor.
Mister, mister!
Money! One coin, please!
Money.
Mister, mister!
Money! One coin, please!
I am Cuba.
Why are you running away?
You came here to have fun?
Go ahead, have fun!
Isn't this a happy picture?
Don't avert your eyes. Look!
I am Cuba.
For you, I am the casino, the bar, the hotels.
But the hands of these children and old people are also me.
I hoped and prayed that it would rain for you, cane.
I've helped you.
Now you help me.
Grow tall, taller than me.
I used to think... the worst in life was death.
Now I know better.
The worst is life.
I am so frightened for my children.
All my life I have worked, and all that time I have lived in debt.
Grow tall, sugarcane.
Not for me; for them.
You hear me? Grow tall.
Papa, it's Senor Acosta.
Busy working, Pedro?
Yeah, working.
Well, soon you'll be able to take a little rest.
I've sold these lands to the United Fruit Company.
What about my sugarcane?
You raised it on my land!
But I worked it with my own sweat.
I give that sweat to you as a gift.
What about my house?
Your house isn't your house anymore.
Have you forgotten this?
You can't forge a signature like that.
No, you can't forge a signature like that.
Pedro, your house isn't yours anymore.
Your house isn't yours anymore.
I've sold these lands to United Fruit.
I've sold these lands to United Fruit.
You grew your sugarcane on my land.
Your house isn't yours anymore.
Why did they come, Papa?
What happened?
Nothing important.
Why are you standing there like a stick?
We need to get back to work.
Papa, are you tired?
Papa, are you tired?
I am not tired.
I am not tired!
I am not tired!
I am not tired!
I am not tired.
I am not tired!
I am not tired!
Today has been a wonderful day.
Just great!
You can go to the village today.
Have some fun. Listen to some music.
Really, Papa?
What about you?
I am too old.
Music was made for the young.
You're not old, Papa.
You are not old.
Go on.
Here, take this, Pablo.
But this is your last peso, Papa.
Today it's the last one, but soon we'll have lots of money.
Don't you see how much money there is here?
Don't you see how much money there is here?
Don't you see how much money there is here?
Two Coca-Colas.
Give me some money.
Let's go, my guajira, let's go to Havana.
Let's go, my guajira, let's go to the city.
I like parties, rooster fights, my hammock, and my shack.
I like the curve of your waist.
I like the way your hips move, my sweet.
Let's go, my guajira, let's go to Havana.
Let's go, my guajira, let's go to the city.
The sway of your hips has the wonderful flavor of ripe fruit.
So does the twist of your body.
Prepare the saddle and mount the rhythm.
Beat the drums!
Look over there, Pancho!
Aren't those old Pedro's children?
Looks as if their business is doing well.
Beat the drums.
Swing that body.
Watch her move.
It's the greatest.
Move your feet.
Move your feet.
I am Cuba.
Sometimes it seems to me that the sap of my palm trees are full of blood.
Sometimes it seems to me that the murmuring sounds around us are not the ocean but choked-back tears of the people.
Who answers for this blood?
Who is responsible for these tears?
General Fulgencio Batista, honorable president of the republic, receives an award.
I'm going to stop.
Let's part here.
See you tomorrow.
Hold on.
What?
I was thinking.
Maybe it's better not to spend the night at home.
Okay.
They didn't hurt you?
Calm down.
It's all over.
- What's your name?
- Gloria.
Well, Gloria, you're all right.
They're gone.
Calm down.
- And you, what's your name?
- Enrique.
Thank you, Enrique.
Extra! Extra!
The latest news!
Fidel Castro and all those with him... were killed in the Oriente province!
Stop at the university.
They killed Fidel Castro.
Here. It's in the paper.
Where's Alberto?
Alberto, Fidel Castro has been killed!
It's a lie, Enrique.
Here's what we need to do.
We have to let all Havana know that this is a lie.
Fidel Castro is alive.
He and his comrades have landed in the Oriente province...
Careful.
And have begun the struggle.
Write this down :
Batista is spreading the rumor that Fidel is dead to divert the people.
Fidel is in the Sierra Maestra.
He's gathering all honest people under the banner of the revolution.
Read this.
They've killed Juan, Carlos, and Luis.
Are we just going to go on sitting here with our hands folded?
No, Enrique, we won't just be sitting around.
That fat murderer is going to keep killing our comrades.
Everything is planned.
We're ready, but this is not the time.
Why not?
So we kill this one, but in his place, they'll put another.
We'll kill that one too.
So that's how we're going to spend the rest of our lives?
What are we going to accomplish by killing one man?
They'll just put another one in his place only much harsher.
And he'll keep on killing our comrades!
You cannot confuse people, or one man, with a system.
But people make the system.
True, but we have to struggle against the system, not the people.
I understand. But this is not a human being. He's a murderer.
He's killing our comrades.
Don't you think
I want to kill him too?
But they have landed successfully.
Fidel is alive.
There is a new struggle developing there, and we must assist that effort.
The people have to know everything!
I know, but what we do with this murderer is just as important.
Let's decide.
We'll discuss this later. Later.
When? When?
If you want, raise the question at the group meeting.
Understand, not now.
Alberto, they killed Pepe last night.
And what are we going to do about it?
I have already told you.
We'll discuss this later.
The forgiveness, you sing my song.
With such melody, it tries to get me to forget your betrayal.
You want to come back.
Perhaps you think of me.
Perhaps you cry for me.
Perhaps, but is that really you?
Now you beg for forgiveness and you sing your song.
With such melody, it tries to get me to forget your betrayal.
But now don't you understand that it's taken you too long to come back and that I cannot forget that you made me cry?
I won't be able to forgive you.
What's the matter with you?
Can't you see where you're going?
You're nuts! Are you crazy?
Are you asleep?
You were right under my wheels.
You maniac. Imbecile!
Are you drunk? Answer me!
What's wrong?
This guy almost got me put in jail.
What is he, crazy?
He's just lovesick.
Be careful, Enrique. Watch out when you're in the middle of the street.
- Don't be mad, old man.
- Get him out of here.
Where to, Enrique?
What's up?
What's the matter?
Enrique, what's going on?
I couldn't...
He was having fried eggs for breakfast.
Fried eggs?
What are you talking about?
Tell me!
He was with the kids.
I couldn't...
Did you consider the consequences?
Who gave you permission to do this?
Who?
Shit!
Open up!
Everybody stay where you are!
Search them!
Whose book is this?
Yours?
Who does this book belong to?
Lenin : ''The State and Revolution''
- Whose book is this?
- It's ours.
- Yours?
- It's our book.
And anybody who hasn't read it is an ignoramus.
Long live freedom!
Long live the revolution!
Cubans! Fidel lives!
He's up in the Sierra Maestra with his comrades.
He and his comrades are fighting against Batista.
Long live liberty!
Death to the tyrant!
Liberty or death!
Down with tyranny!
I am Cuba.
There are two paths for people when they are born.
The path of slavery, it crushes and decays.
And the path of the star, it illuminates but kills.
You will choose the star.
Your path will be hard, and it will be marked by blood.
But in the name of justice, wherever a single person goes, thousands more will rise up.
And when there are no more people, then the stones will rise up.
I am Cuba.
When men are born, there are two paths.
You will choose the star.
The path will be hard...
And it will be marked by blood.
For the last time, clear the steps.
It's an order!
Run to the battle, fellow people of Bayamo.
Your country looks at you with pride.
Do not fear a glorious death.
To die for your motherland is to live.
To live enchained is to submit to insult and ignominy.
Hear the bugle sound.
Prepare for battle, O valiant ones.
Onward.
Come on, guys!
All together--the cars!
Enrique! Enrique!
Where is Fidel?
Fidel?
I am Fidel.
- Where is Fidel?
- I am Fidel.
I am Fidel.
I am Cuba.
These are the people about whom legends will be told.
From all parts, they're coming to the mountains of the Sierra Maestra.
They are going to fight.
Come in. Have a seat.
Amelia, bring another plate.
Do you need the rifle, too?
No.
These hands aren't for killing.
They're for sowing.
But is this land you are sowing yours?
Have you finished?
Don't you wish there were a school on your land?
Shoes for your kids?
That when they are sick, they would be treated?
Or are they going to live the way you do?
I want to live in peace.
Me too.
What about this, then?
So as to live in peace.
Get out!
He's exhausted, Mariano.
Let him stay the night.
Do you hear that, Mariano?
They're bombing the revolutionaries.
Amelia, calm down.
Amelia, calm down.
Amelia! Amelia!
Listen, Mariano, listen!
Amelia, wait! Wait!
Amelia! Calm down, dear.
Amelia!
Mariano, my child!
Amelia!
I have to go.
I have to go.
Halt!
This is the Insurgent Radio broadcasting from the Oriente province, from Sierra Maestra, free territory of Cuba.
Cubans, join the struggle.
You, victim of humiliation, hatred, and crime.
You have borne on your shoulders injustice, destitution, and the deprivation of your rights. Listen!
Revolution! Revolution!
In the face of hostile malice, you, peasant; you, worker; you, student; you, Cuban!
Raise your armed fist!
The revolution is fighting for the complete and absolute national independence of our motherland.
The revolution fights for the right of everyone to get an education and equal opportunity, for the defense of life given to each of us.
In defense of people's well-being, we fight!
Each family has the right to adequate housing.
Each Cuban has the right to work.
Thousands of heads of families and thousands of young people have no work. They have no future.
The revolution will industrialize the country.
It will eliminate unemployment and will restore to the people all the wealth that was stolen from them.
You, farmer.
You, worker.
You, student.
Take your place in the struggle.
This is your revolution!
Liberty or death!
I knew you would come.
I knew it.
Now I need a rifle.
A rifle?
This guy thinks they grow on trees!
Plant some.
Maybe more will grow.
Look, Mariano.
You have to capture a rifle in battle.
Every one of us has done it that way.
I am Cuba.
Your hands have gotten used to farming tools.
But now a rifle is in your hands.
You are not shooting to kill.
You are firing at the past.
You are firing to protect your future.
Run to the battle, fellow people of Bayamo.
Your country looks at you with pride.
Do not fear a glorious death.
To die for your motherland is to live.
To live enchained is to submit to insult and ignominy.
Hear the bugle sound.
Prepare for battle, O valiant ones.
Onward.

Come here. That's a boy.
In you go, in you go!
Joyce, breakfast's ready!
Blimey, Marjorie, this is piping!
Mrs. Clitherow's advertising for a lodger next door.
It's in the Classified under Vacancies.
It's different for Mrs. Clitherow. She's a war widow. We don't need a lodger.
Did I say a word about getting a lodger? - You were about to.
All my life I've provided. I've given two of your daughters fully catered weddings.
I helped Vernon when he needed it and still managed to build up a tidy nest egg.
I'm not going to have the neighbors saying I can't cut the mustard at this stage of the game
- Putting your foot down, Stanley
Very funny.
No, I've made up my mind, I m taking a lodger.
He's having the room with the double bed. - Joyce can have that
Joyce is staying with me.
Joyce! Get down here! And sharpish!
I'll be down in a minute!
Morning.
- Morning, slow poke.
Did you know that Sir
Walter Raleigh's wife. loved him so much that for
30 years after his death... she carried his head around in her handbag
Eat your breakfast and don't be common.
Mr. Guppy? Maurice?
I am that man. Have been all my life.
Sorry. Do I know you?
I'm Harold.Your brother.
How do you do?
- Hello...
Lemon puff?
- Thanks.
I expect you're wondering where I sprung from.
You're welcome here,
Harold. You're family.
Even if Morris hasn't seen you since you were a child.
I was in Australia for a bit. I've been travelling ever since I left the home,
I just left the Merchant Navy and decided to look you up.
Missed it. You know, family.
Well, you would.. I expect.
I'll top the pot up.
She'll warm to you, Harold.
I'm sorry if this sounds hard...
...we don't know you, you're a total stranger.
I only want to get to know him.
Look, he must feel the same.
Spit it out Harold, are you looking for somewhere to stay?
That's not why I'm here.
He's my brother, he's family.
Maurice has family. I'm his family.
I just don't want any trouble.
Very good, Joyce.
Remember, you are Naiads and
Dryads, spirits of wood and water.
So smile. Smile! Water nymphs are always happy.
That's not a smile
Pauline, that's a grimace.
They may be free spirits, but they usually keep in step.
And they always keep their bottoms in.
From the top, Mr. Jarvis.
You have a room to let?
I hope you like dogs, Mr...
- Guppy. Harold Guppy. I love animals.
That's an excellent quality in a man. Show warm nature.
You never see Mr.
Khrushchev playing with a pet
His name's Princess. After
Princess Margaret Rose.
But it's a boy.
- But he doesn't know that. Upstairs?
Stay, Princess.
That's my husband's room.
He's at work. He's a machine operator.
Always managed to hold a job. Even with one leg.
Bathroom.
This will be your room.
It has a double bed. - So I see, yes.
You have full use of all facilities.
My gentlemen have always been part of the family.
They usually call me "mum."
- Just what I'm looking for.
My daughter and I share the back room.
My husband and I keep separate rooms for medical reasons.
So! Would you like a cup of tea?
There's no need to go to all this trouble Mrs Beasley.
We don't stint in this household, Mr. Guppy
Had enough of rationing during the war.
I think you'll find us very generous. Now, tuck in.
Is that your daughter?
- Maureen, yes.
Living in the Midlands now.
Married a man with property in Ashby de la Zouch.
I made that wedding dress.
Yes, the little bridesmaid's
- Very professional.
Yes. I'm a devil with the needle.
Come to me with all your mending.
Here's a little bridesmade Joyce.
She's my late blessin'.
Thirteen in a fortnight.
You'll be here for the party.
Are you a local man?
I have family here. That's why I came.
Very close. They moved here after I was sent away.
Sent away?
Yes, I was 10. My dad was dead.
And my mum couldn't get a handle on me. I was... difficult.
So my mum had me sent away.
This is very disturbing, Mr. Guppy.
Well, I was a bit of a tearaway. She couldn't cope.
I was only ten, but I was a little beggar.
I got sorted out when I joined the Navy.
They did tests on me. I had an accident.
Well, I got in a little fight, and, well, any, anyway... The doctors got hold of me, did these tests...
What kind of tests?
- Blood tests and such.
Turns out I had low blood sugar, which caus me to lose my temper.
Now I have a couple of boiled sweets every day. And I'm happy as Larry.
Roundtrees are the best.
That or a sugar lumo.
But, you haven't been in any trouble.
...have you, Harold?
Don't worry about it.
I was just a bit of a rapscallion, that's all.
When I was 10.
Yes, well boys will be boys.
See you in the pub.
Marjorie! - That will be Mr. Beasley.
Do me a favor. We agreed on three pounds for the rent... but I will tell him it's three guineas. It s just a little deception.
Whatever you say Mrs. Beasley.
And don't be disturbed by his missing leg.
Does he have any references?
Oh, Dad, you do show me up. Mr.
Guppy's Navy man, isn't that so?
...careful, we got a young girl in the house. You understand?
Really Stanley, you are shocking, it's all been arranged
Now please just remember your manners and shake on it!
Marjorie! Is that you?
You'll wake Joyce up! - Come here for a moment, love.
Sit down just a minute.
Stanley!
- I'd like some company, love.
I miss ya, Marjorie. At night.
Remember what the doctor said.
But it's been 6 years since you had that trouble.
Stanley, you know i can't risk intimacy
I just need a little... comfort, love.
Stanley, if If you don't let go,
I'll spill this water on you what's it.
That'll cool down your ardor, a notch.
Come on, love. - For heaven's sake!
Stanley, be a man.
What's up mum?
- Nothing, darling. Run off to bed.
I'll bring you a glass of water.
Mum?
- Yeah?
I'm bleeding.
Down there.
- No need to draw a picture.
Have they told you about this at school? - I think so.
So. You know what to do then?
- Think so.
Good. We'll find some...equipment that
Maureen left behind in the cupboard.
I'm gonna make us some cocoa then.
Joyce, ever wonder what your life will be like when you're a grown woman?
All the time. I'll have a man,
I expect.
Like Montgomery Gift or Dirk Bogart.
He won't go to the pub every night.
He'll stay at home and tell me things and help me do the washin' up.
I expect he'll be a man with two legs.
Joyce, you know, if ever you're confused about anythin', if ever you wanna talk or anything you want to know, you can always ask one of your sisters.
- Yes, Mum.
Men aren't the answer though, Joyce.
Will I have to go to school tomorrow?
Yes! Not using this as an excuse every month
Anvway we've another lodger moving in tomorrow.
Don't want you getting under his feet.
Are you coming to my birthday party? -Yes, I have a new dress.
It's going to be the most wonderful birthday party ever. Much better than Valerie Andre
Will there be any boys there?
Better than boys, Pauline.
- What do you mean?
There's going to be a man.
A proper one. - Who is he?
He's our new lodger. He'll be there for tea.
What does he look like?
- He looks a bit like Montgomery Clift.
What did you girls learn at school this week, Pauline?
We started biology with Miss Newborn.
Oh. What's that all about, then?
It's th study of living orgasms.
Well I'm off down to the pub.
I think I'll join you. Thanks for the tea, Mrs Beasley.
What? What have I said?
- Joice you are a disgrace!
You made Mr. Guppy feel very uncomfortable.
Now when he comes back, I expect you to be nice to him.
Show him your stamp album or something.
I don't want him off to the pub with your father every night.
Bang! Blew it clean off. Clean slice.
They dragged me screamin' into the trench.
Fully conscious. "I lost me leg!
I lost me leg!" Then
I, I hear this voice.
It's the sergeant.
He said, "You haven't lost your leg, son.
It's over there with my arm."
Started to laugh. He was always the bastard, that sergeant.
But he saved my life. Made me laugh.
You were very lucky,
Stanley. - Bloody lucky,
In France, they still employ someone every day to go out and collect bones off the battlefield.
My leg could still be out there.
And the sergeant's arm.
- and the sergeant's arm.
Your round, Harold
Best foot forward, Stanley.
Blimey, it's pelting down there.
You're going straight back out again.
Princess needs his constitutional.
No ifs, no buts, no arguments. Out you go.
No, no need for you to get another soaking, Harold.
Dad's used to it.
What can I get you? Sandwich, biscuit, cocoa?
I think I'll just turn in Mrs Beasley.
Now, Harold. What must you call me?
Mum. - That's better.
- I think I'll just turn in, Mum.
I'll have a nice breakfast ready for you first thing.
Night.
- Good night.
Mr. Guppy.
Have you heard of the hagfish?
- Heard of the what?
It's really nasty. It kills its victims by wrapping itself around them so tight that it digs into their flesh.
And once it's buried itself inside them, it eats them from the inside out.
Miss Newborn told us that in Biology.
Ah... - Good night!
- Good night! you missed!
- Come on!
Harold can't get me!
Ah, you're dead! You're...
I'm not, no, me no dead.
Me protected by heap big magic of sacred tomahawk!
Ah, oh, you monster.
I nearly threw a fit!
Customer, Mrs. Beasley.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Paxon.
It's Mrs. Fox-Davies now. I've married again - Oh, congratulations.
I've brought my lingerie in to be cleaned. It's my wedding trousseau.
I never thought the day would plunge again.
Roland took me to Capri.
Have you ever been to Capri, Mrs.Beasley?
Isn't that where Gracie Fields lives?
- It's just heavenly.
Yes, my husband doesn't approve of
Gracie Fields. She married an Italian.
It looks just like Elizabeth Taylor.
Yes...
The wages of sin, Pamela. Be warned.
I knew Angela Paxman when her hair was natural.
She was showin' her scanties when she was sixteen, and she's still showin' them now
- Oh, but they're beautiful.
I tell you Pamela.
I'd rather be dead than brazen.
I wouldn't swap places with Angela Fox whatsit for all the silk drawers in China.
Remember, people talk,
Pamela. People talk.
I'm really sorry!
- Harold!
Iris! Good Lord, how are you?
I'm fine. How are you settling in?
Very well, I'm a window cleaner.
Got myself a lovely home, nice family. I've landed on my feet.
Good. You will come and see us, won't you
Now that you've found us?
Of course. I can't stop now. I have to get t the shop before it closes.
Harold, come for Christmas.
Maurice would be thrilled.
That's lovely. Thank you.
I've come for the birthday cake.
- All right.
Isn't there any real food in this house?
Harold? Can I borrow you a tick?
What do you think of our little girl?
Well, how do I look?
Like the belle of the ball
- Thanks.
"Will I grow rich?" Said the bells of Shore Ditch.
"When will that be?"
Here comes a casualty
I'd be convinced.
In comes a to chop off your...
...head!
No!
Mum, I don't why you didn't do this on Saturday night.
It would've been much more convenient. There's school tomorrow.
It's Joyce's birthday today, not
Saturday. It wouldn't be the same.
It was not wise to let those girls have so mi cider. They seem quite tipsy,
They'll have hangovers tomorrow.
Oh, nonsense. You can't get drunk on cider
Not on Whiteley's. It's a well established firm.
Besides, they're grammar school girls.
Grammar school girls know how to behave
I don't know. The way you see things sometimes is beyond me.
Your new lodger seems to have won a few hearts.
He's enjoying himself as much as the children. They love him.
Yes. Harold certainly has a way with the little ones. Joyce simply dotes on him.
And he's, uh, very nice looking.
Deirdre. Remember you're a married woman.
I still got eyes on my head.
Do you know any more party games, Mr. Guppy?
Do I know any party games?
You want a kiss?
- Sure.
Come here, gorgeous.
You're the apple of my eye. Don't you forget it.
He always gets maudlin when he's drunk.
You spin it for me will ya?
I'm too old for this sort of thing
I've been longing for this since you've been here.
Any chance of cocoa, Mum?
We used the last of the milk in the trifle.
You should've ordered extra.
I had to come, Harold.
I wouldn't have, only...
Well, it's probably the Ruby wine.
Dutch courage.
- What do you want?
Just to talk.
May I sit on the bed?
I like your pajamas, Harold.
They're very distinguished.
I think you should go back to your room, get some sleep.
I can't sleep. You've got me so
I can't sleep, Harold.
I'm a very lonely woman.
I Don't know whether you've noticed that, but I am, I'm very lonely.
That color suits you. - Keep your voice down. Stanley might hear
May I get into bed with you? Please?
Please. I want to. You'll...
You'll make me very happy.
I know I shouldn't.
May I, please?
- No, I don't think you should.
Don't reject me, I couldn't bear it.
Mr. Beasley's always been very friendly with me.
I don't want to have a scene with him.
It's not wise for you to get in here with me.
Stanley and I get on very well together.
Don't be angry with me.
- Stop carrying on like this.
I'm really frightened that
Stanley will hear what is goin' on and come to the wrong conclusion.
- Stop goin' on about that man!?
He's been a beast to me. know what my life's been like with that man all these years.
He's made me so miserable.
I just want a little comfort.
That's all.
I've been so sad for such a long time.
I just need to cuddle.
Please.
Stop that.
- I wasn't doing anything
Harold, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
- I'm sorry. I am sorry.
That's all right. Come on.
Oh, hurry up.
Take it off.
Mum?
- It's Joyce, it's Joyce!
Run along to bed, Joyce. You've had enough excitement for one day.
Why are you in bed with Harold?
Curiosity killed the cat, young miss, and don't you raise your voice to me.
Come back to our room.
I don't like it on my own.
Since when were you giving the orders in this house?
Now, just go back to bed.
- No.
Keep your voice down, you'll wake your father.
Can I get into bed with you?
- No.
There's loads of room on this side.
- I said no. Now scram.
It's not fair. I'll tell Dad.
- Joyce, be quiet!
I don't care if dad wakes up. it's not fair, it's my birthday!
Well, you may as well get in if it'll shut you up. Put the landing light off.
You can't allow that.
That's not decent.
Nonsense. There won't be any harm done I'm her mother.
It's all right.
Now, good night.
Good night.
We'll speak in morning
She's asleep?
I think so. - Good.
Oh, Mum.
Good morning, Harold.
You overslept. You don't want to be late on your first day of work.
I've packed you a lunch. Sandwiches.
And I've used the last of that nice lamb.
You know cold meat gets stuck under your plate.
I've prepared you egg. No complaint
- We got our first Christmas card.
From the British Limbless
Ex Servicemen Association.
They're always very prompt.
Hurry up, Harold. You're walking me to school.
You don't need walking to school, Joyce.
Harold promised me last night.
You do remember last night, Harold?
Come along Harold.
Was that adultery last night, Harold?
Weren't you asleep? - Well, sort of.
It was a bit difficult.
I expect it has to be kept secret
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You must've been havin' a dream.
If it was adultery, you're lucky you're not Japanese. - Why?
The Japanese used to crucify men for adultery. Just the man, that is.
And while he was slowly dying, he was forced to look on as his girlfriend was ripped in two by a pair of bullocks.
That is disgusting. - And King John hanged three of his wife's boyfriends over her bed as a warning to her
I don't know where you get these horrible stories.
What do you do exactly when you're having adultery?
Well, it isn't the sort of thing nice people talk about.
It's not decent. They won't like you.
Harold?
Will you kiss me?
- No.
Well, we could go back there. Nobody will see us.
I just want to know what it's like. Looks so silly.
You're too young. - I'm thirteen. I know how to smoke and everything, look.
Stop messin' about, Joyce, you'll be late for school. Come on.
It's not fair. Harold!You should be nice to me.
Otherwise I might tell
Dad about the secret.
He might think he's King
John. Then where will you be?
I won't give in to blackmail, Joyce.
Of course not.
What's blackmail?
Oh, Dad! - Oh, Stanley, if you can't do anything useful, just get out from under our feet.
- Do you fancy a drink, Harold?
No. Harold's helping us with the Christmas decorations, aren't you, Harold?
- Yes, Mum.
Well, I'm off to the...
- To the pub! Yes, see you later.
Don't you have any homework, Joyce?
It's the school holidays, Dad.
Oh, yeah, heh, of course.
Well, I'll see you later then.
How about a glass of Ruby wine?
Thanks. - I want some wine.
- You won't like it.
I'll tell Dad on you.
If you say that one more time,
I swear I'm gonna swing for you.
Here. Have some of mine.
Will you buy me a bicycle for Christmas, Harold?
If you go on like this, you won't grow up to t a lady.
Good night, Dad.
- G'night, Mum.
Happy Christmas, everybody.
Happy Christmas.
- It's fantastic.
Say cheese.
- Cheese!
Boy, what has Mummy got for you?
Open wide.
Now, Harold. What must you call me?
Iris was very upset that you didn't show up last Christmas.
It was a big gesture for her to invite you. We didn't hear a word.
Well, I couldn't. I can't explain.
Why are you here now?
Are you in trouble
Yeah. No, I don' think so.
Is it your job?
- I haven't got a job
I thought you were a window cleaner.
Oh, that was just for a couple of weeks.
Then I worked at a building site.
What happened?
- I got cold.
How do you pay your rent?
I thought you came back here to be near your family.
That's me.
I'm all the family you have.
I've only seen you a couple of times. You seem to be avoiding us.
Suddenly here you are stinking of whiskey and upsetting my wife.
Do you want me to go?
- Listen, Harold...
I'm not tryin' to push you away. I'm your brother.
I want to know what's wrong.
Talk to me.
It's my landlady. I've been carrying on with my landlady like married couple.
You don't mean... Oh, Harold!
Not a platonic relationship.
Yeah, I'm afraid so, Maurice.
Every night for months.
So, how old is this woman, Harold?
Is there sugar in that?
I need sugar.
Thank you, Mrs. Rumperts. -Thank you.
I need this by next Thursday, please.
- Certainly.
What name is it?
- Mrs. Guppy.
Guppy? My lodger's name is Guppy.
Well, I call him my lodger but really he's one of the family.
Harold Guppy. Any relation?
He's my brother in law.
- Well, isn't that a coincidence?
Yes. Isn't it? Thursday, then?
Mrs Beasley, can I bother you for a sec?
Yes, Mr. Pugh? - I need a little help here. Woman's touch,
I've been given the sack, Mrs. Beasley.
Good gracious, why?
- It's a question of morals.
If you take my drift, it's a matter of decency
Oh, Mrs. Beasley.
I'm gonna have a baby.
Pamela, you silly, silly girl.
I'll fetch your hat and coat.
Clean her up, and send her home.We can't be having this on the premises.
No use crying over spilt milk, dear.
Mrs. Beasley, what have I done?
I thought that was pretty obvious.
It's a bit late to cry about it.
I met him at a dance.
- Who? - You know. Him.
He took me to the cricket pavilion...
- Spare me the details.
He said he loved me. But
I haven't seen him since.
Well, who can blame him, Pamela?
No decent man is going to hook up with a girl with morals as loose as that.
Oh, please don't be cruel, Mrs. Beasley.
You know you can't have your cake and eat it.
It wouldn't be fair on the rest of us!
There are lots of people who'd like to throw wind and do as they please.
How many times have I told you... a lady's reputation is all she has.
I didn't say it'd be easy to keep.
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela.
Please, Mr. Pugh, I need the money.
I'm sorry, Miss Greaves, we can't condone this sort of behavior in this firm.
We have a role to play in the community. Responsibilities.
Sorry.
There are times when I thank the Lord my girls passed their grammar school entrance exam.
A grammar school girl would never go for a jaunt with a man.
A moral fiber. Education is a wonderful thing.
A wonderful thing.
Give over, Joyce, What are you doing?
I picked some flowers.
Aren't they pretty?
Well, you Shouldn't pick these. You'll wet your bed.
Oh, that's an old wive's tale. And that's dandelions, not these things. like being alone with you. Without Mum, I mean.
I'm glad she bought you the bike. She buys you lots of presents, doesn't she?
We'd better make tracks. Come on.
I don't want to qo home.
I want to stay here all night!
Catch our deaths!
- No we wouldn't.
We could stay in a hotel.
We passed one down the road.
We couldn't afford it. And anyway, your dad would murder me.
He's old and stupid. He wouldn't know.
Don't talk like that about your dad. You're lucky to have one.
He'd skin me alive.
We could wire Mum. Say we had apuncture or I twisted my ankle or something.
And then we could stay in a hotel and have a meal with ice cream
Don't be daft, Joyce.
Please, Harold, I want to.
Come on.
Harold, you should do as I say.
Unless youre looking for trouble
I'm afraid all our twin bedded rooms are occupied.
That's all right. My daughter and I are used to bunking together.
No luggage?
- No.
Follow me, sir.
I hope you'll both be comfortable.
If you need anything, just ask for Bunty.
Get into bed, Harold.
- When you're asleep.
Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're very pretty.
I'm prettier than Mum.
She's old. She's a grandmother, and she wears glasses.
You're prettier than Mum, yeah.
You get into bed with Mum.
Yeah.
It's not fair.
You need a shave.
- Do I?
None of the boys i know have to shave.
They just have fluff on their faces.
I like it.
You wanna play a dangerous game, my girl.
You mustn't carry a chip on your shoulder.
Don't lecture me, Joyce.
- I'm interested in you.
Everyone's a bloody mind doctor these days, aren't they? Ask a few questions, get a few answers, read a few articles in the Woman's Realm and wham!
All problems solved.
You're just a kid, Joyce.
Stop messin' around with me.
I am not messin' around. I like you.
You don't know me. You imagine me in a certain way.
What are you goin' on about?
Leave me alone! You don't give a damn about me!
Harold, you're scaring me.
- Alright.
Now tell me you ddidn't think about me last night in bed
Harold, don't!
- And you don't lie in bed and imagine me pressin' against you, naked.
Even with your eyes closed you can still se me, can't you?
Every detail... the heat of my breath on your cheek... the shape of my mouth, the smoothness of my skin.
Imagine my skin rubbing against you through your night dress.
My hips against your hips... my hands all over you, everywhere.
Imagine. Undressing you.
Harold! - And you let your hands explore me, don't you?
And you push me down on the bed. want me to take all your clothes off.
You want me to climb onto you, and into you.
Deep. Inside you.
It doesn't go away when you open your eye does it? Look at me.
You can still feel me, can't you?
Yes. 1 feel you.
Joyce.
- Yes?
Don't forget to clean your teeth.
Now you know how it feels like having someone messing with you
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever think you are too old for one of those, my girl.
Now get upstairs and pack some things,
You're gonna stay with Mona and Jack.
If you've laid one finger on my daughter I'll kill you.
You didn't, did you, Harold?
Did you play games with Joyce?
What if 1 did?
She's my baby. She's just my baby.
No I didn't touch her.
But for God's sake, with all the carryin' on and what she's seen, would it really have mattered if I had?
Oh, Harold. It's different with us.
We're grown ups. Grown ups are supposed to have these feelings.
What feelings?
- You know. Don't make me say it.
Look, there are no feelings in what we do, we just go at it like animals rutting.
Harold!
- It's just sex! Lust! Copulation!
Fucking! - Stop it! You are being deliberately cheap!
But it is cheap the way we do it!		But it is cheap!
How dare you speak to me like that.
I'm not some squalid little tart ready to be insulted. I am a lady!
See the way 1 look at it, the only feelings you've got are between your legs.
Filth. Filth.
You're a hip, uh, hippo, what is that word? You're a bloody hippo!
I'm going to stay at my brother's.
Yeah, righty o.
I made you some sandwiches.
Can't have my boy getting hungry.
I'm sorry, Harold. It's all my fault.
Everything's my fault.
Cut the crusts off, how you like them. - Thanks.
I've tried my best.
I'm a good wife and good a mother.
You can ask anybody that.
Anybody.
Just not satisfied, that's all.
And that's pride.
I opened that tin of sardines.
I know you h your eye on them.
I do have feelings, Harold.
I need. I need...
I need you.
I've joined the Army.
- What?
You've done what Harold? - I joined the Army. 12 year engagement.
Find something you like and stick with it.
You've had your chanches.
- I don't have any qualifications.
You don't need qualifications.
I think it'll be good for me.
- It's that woman, isn't it?
She's been driving me nuts,
But you don't want to join the Army, Harold
Believe me. I served 11 years myself.
You're not cut out for it.
1 just don't think you'd like it.
I grew up in reform schools. 1 spent all those years in the Merchant Navy.
I like being told what to do, I'm used to it.
Don't worry I'll be all right.
Where will you be posted?
I asked to be sent as far from here as possible.
Dear Harold. Please come back home. I will be just a mother to you.
I would be so happy to do just your cooking, washing and ironing.
Think what comfort you've had for two pounds a week.
Baths when you like...
Cook what you like for breakfast.
Just let me see you.
If you're worried about the money, I have enough money to buy you out of the army.
30 pounds is a lot money, but it's worth it fo you.
Please write to me soon.
I shall write to you every day.
I enclose a postal order for five shillings. Love, Mum.
P.S. Do you know where the red handled pliers are?
Hello, Mrs. Guppy.
Good afternoon.
Have you heard from Harold recently?
Oh, yes. We correspond regularly.
Does he seem happy to you?
With the Army - yes.
Army life suits him down to the ground.
I think he needs the discipline, don't you?
And there's his girlfriend, of course.
Jean. He's going to pop the question.
But here I am telling you. I expect you know all about it, don't you?
Oh, yes, he tells me everything. Like a son me.
Princess Margaret's personal message issued from Clearance House began with these words.
"I would like it to be known that I have decided not to..."
"...marry group Captain
Peter Townsend."
"Mindful of the church's teaching that
Christian marriage is indissoluble,"
...and conscious of my duty to the
Commonwealth,
"1 have resolved to put these considerations before any others."
The love and affection, sympathy and understanding, of a nation and Commonwealth... go out to Princess Margaret in her couragous decision.
It's so sad, isn't it?
That poor man. How could she do that to him?
I don't understand.
King Edward gave up his throne for Mrs. Simpson.
Princess Margaret's got nothin' to lose.
She's not the Queen. Poor man.
Come on. Blow your nose and forget about it, you soft apeth.
Do you remember Mrs. Ellis? Ruth Ellis.
That woman they hanged last Summer.
Oh, yeah.
- I didn't understand her, either.
She shot her lover, because he was leavin' her.
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, she'd never get him back once he was dead, would she?
It's barmy killing somebody for love.
It's just stupid.
I've bought you a present.
- It's a bit early for Christmas.
Oh, Harold!
If 1 ruled the whole world, I would give up my throne for you, Jean.
Oh, Harold!
Come on, tuck in here, you soft apeth.
Good girl.
Look at that, eh?
Shut up, Pauline, somebody will hear us.
I want to go home! Leave me alone!
What's going on?
Sounds like World War III
We were just playing.
- I wanna go home!
I hate you, Joyce Beasley! You hurt me!
Joyce! what have you done to upset Pauline?
She put her hand up my gym slip and hurt me and she said it was a game.
I want to go home!
And I'll tell you something.
You're not my best friend anymore, that's for certain.
Valerie Andrews was right about you. You' peculiar!
What was that all about?
Mum. Harold sent me a birthday card.
He wrote to you?
I don't like to take this tone with you, Harold. but unless you stop this nonsense and come home I will take Joice to police and tell them about the night you went to the hotel with her
I'm not bluffing. Harold. I'm doing this for your own good.
You are family. We all want you back and will make you happy here. Mum.
P.S. 1 enclose a 10 shilling postal order.
Mrs. Beasley? Telephone!
He said he'd ring back in 5 minutes.
I don't approve of private use of office equipment!
This is a business, bare that in mind
- Oh, I will, Mr. Pugh, thank you.
Hello?
- Hello? Mum?
When are you coming home, Harold?
- I'm getting married.
I want you to leave me alone.
Stop writing and sending me money.
Bugger!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Good boy. Must not get anxious, it's only mum.
I've got a new start here, mum.
- Now, be quiet, Harold, and listen.
I'm going to send you a check to get you out of the Army.
Now you've gotta stop this.
Shut up. You've got me at the end of my tether, if that was your intention.
It's time to come home.
You've had your little jaunt.
If you don't come back soon,
I'm writing this Jean person you're mixed up with... and tell her about all the goings on with Joyce
Oh, how'd you know about Jean?
Who told you about Jean.
I don't mean to be unpleasant, but
I have to be firm for your own good.
Hurt me just as much as it hurts you, Harold.
Hello? Hello?
Who is it at this time of nigt?
- You go to bed, I'll deal with it.
Are you stayin' for good this time,
Harold?
Well, I dunno. We'll see. No more messin' about, eh?
No. I mean yes. I'm sorry about...
Yeah, me too. Yeah, all my fault.
Dance?
- No, no
Come on, it's easy. You just count one, two, three. - Oh, goodness, dear me.
One, two, three, one, two, three.
My foot. - Sorry.
S'all right. Did you know, that in
Victorian times girls in the ballet would regularly catch fire from the footlights?
No. - They'd spark up like
Catherine wheels.
Incinerated.
- Terrible.
That's why they're called the Corpse de Ballet. Keep in time, Harold.
Harold, don't!
I'll go sit down here.
It's old, but in very good condition.
- Yes, I see.
It's been well looked after.
- It's been my pride and joy.
So what do you think, Harold?
120 pounds.
Can you afford it?
Whatever will keep you here is worth it.
I think it's time we put your father's tea on.
That.s a pretty flower.
Joyce, that's your fourth glass.
- So? Who's counting?
I am. You'll be drunk.
Can't tell me what to do. I do as I like.
I don't know what's gotten into you.
You're talking like a proper madame.
Why won't he do it to me?
- Do what?
What he does to you.
Sex. - You disgusting little mare.
Get upstairs and wash your mouth out with soap and water.
I thought you were a nice girl, Joyce
Shows what you know, I'm no virgin.
I've been with a boy and we've had sexual intercourse.
It happened in Slough, so there.
Shut up! Shut up!
- You can't make me.
I don't believe you.
You've been drinking and are showing off.
There's nothing clever about telling dirty lies
If Harold doesn't do it to me, I'll make a noise every night you go into his room
Dad'll get wise to it.
And that's a promise
That'll stop your hanky panky.
I'll give you a good hiding if you don't stop.
Make me. Make me.
Mum!
- Come on!
No! What are you doing? Harold!
Dad, you can't.
No! Stop it! Get off of me!
It's the answer, Joyce!
No, Harold. No!Let go! I'll tell Dad!
You've got to be cruel to be kind, Joyce.
No!
Just shut up, Joyce!
That should sober her up.
- What are we to do, Harold?
Don't look at me, she's your daughter.
We could send her to boarding school.
Well, boarding school's expensive.
- Stanley's working. I have savings.
My heritance. - What's going on?
What are you plotting?
You're up to something.
Joyce, darling, how would you like to go away to boardin' school?
Don't be stupid. You can't get rid of me that easily.
Don't speak to me like that!
You will do as you are told.
Are you going to stop her?
We have to calm her down before Stanley gets home.
Joyce, come back here!
Stop messin' about!
This is a right mess!
- Go away!
Listen, Joyce. The best idea is to go along with this boarding school idea.
Leave me alone!
- You'll probably enjoy it! - Stop it!
Look at all these Mallory Towers books you've been... - You stupid idiot!
No arguments. She's going.
I might as well kill you and be done with it!
I hate you! I hate you both!
You little basttard, you!
Both of you, calm down! Stop it!
Lovely evening.
Stanley, there's been an accident.
Marjorie tripped on the stairs got her foot caught or something...
She's all right. There's nothing broken. Just a black eye.
Did you push her?
- Course I didn't.
My lady.
What do you want?
- I want to see Maurice.
It's not convenient.
- Can I wait?
I don't wish to be nasty, Harold, but no, you can't. I'm sorry, Harold.
Wait a moment, Harold.
I don't understand why you're here.
We've done everything we can to help you, you won't help yourself.
I think the best thing for you was the Army.
You were going to settle down. Get married.
I bought a hat!
But now you're here with that"woman" again.
We can't do anything more for you.
I want to see my brother.
He doesn't want to see you.
- Is that what he's decided?
Yes.
We have new responsibilities now, Harold.
We're going to have a baby.
I'm sorry to sound cruel, but...
I we don't think you're the sort of person we want to have near our child.
I see.
There... That's it.
Good night, Harold.
- Good night, Iris.
Congratulations.
I'm sorry.
- Where's Joyce?
I sent her to Deirdre's.
- At this time of night?
Oh, no. A couple hours ago, I put her in a cab.
Don't worry. It'll all come out in the wash.
Mum, this is serious.
Do you understand that?
- No.
I don't think I understand anything anymore
Just lately I've been putting	two and two together and making five.
I look out that window at those grey little houses... and those bloody grey little people.
And my whole life comes pressing down on me like a roof.
And I think "I'm just empty.
I'm nearly fifty and I've got no life."
God, how do people live like this?
Husbands who grow old, children who grow up then you die.
Suffering your way out of a life youVe neve really lived.
It makes me want to scream.
Roar my lungs out because I've missed the whole point of everything.
To hell with loneliness.
Harold, to hell with loneliness.
Where did you get the knife from?
Oh, we... It was my son, Vernon's.
He, he was a boy scout. I'd,
I don't want to talk about it.
Just think. We've got the whole night. Just the two of us.
Why don't you go to your husband for this? - I told you, he's a beast to me.
I don't like it when he touches me.
Well, try to like it.
This has to stop.
- Yes, I know, Harold.
But not tonight.
Don't bolt your food. You'll choke.
- I've got to dash, darling,
I've got a meeting.
- You haven't finished.
Sorry, I haven't got the time.
I'll try and get home early.
What's wrong, duchess? Cheer up.
Honestly. Men.
Deirdre, do you love George?
What sort of a question is that?
Do you have other boyfriends?
Joyce! I'm married!
So is Mum.
She's been married for years.
Joyce, have you been listening to gossip?
Has someone been telling you stories abou the war?
What about the war?
Well, there was a time during the war... when somebody, who must have been a very nasty sort of person had nothing better to do than spread malicious stories about people.
And that person started a rumor about Mum
Now there were lots of military types around in town in those days.
And Mum was a lot younger then.
Much more attractive, especially without her glasses.
She used to take in lodgers.
Now Dad only had one leg, so she was an easy target.
But they weren't true, Joyce.
You musn't listen to horrid old stories.
She's a wonderful Mum, we all know that.
It's not an old story I'm thinkin' of.
Well, what is it, then?
She's has a lodger now.
Joyce! She's a grandmother!
Anyway, we shouldn't be talking like this in front of the children.
I have to get to school.
Thanks for breakfast
Bye.
Pauline.
- Just ignore her.
What are you doing in the rain?
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
You looked a bit glum.
- I came bottom in the Latin test.
It's never happened before.
- I'm used to it.
Pauline...
- Yes?
I'm sorry about... you know.
That's okay. Don't mention it.
Would you like to come to tea tonight?
I That's all right. I have to study for my French tomorrow, anyway.
So do I.
Some other time, then.
- Yeah, some other time.
You'd better go before
Valerie sees you talkin' to me.
Where's Joyce?
- Oh, Harold. I've no idea.
She didn't come home lunchtime.
She probably went by
Pauline's. Is there a problem?
She won't be at Pauline's. They don't see eye to eye these days.
She's off sulking somewhere.
She doesn't like my attitude with your mother.
Now I'm not gonna have a fourteen year old tell me what to do.
You know, that girl needs a proper talkin' to about sex.
She has some bad ideas.
- Well, that's no concern of yours.
It's her I'm thinking about. -Will you go please?
Somebody's gotta put her straight.
That's her mother's place, not yours.
- Your mother is useless.
I mean, did she ever tell you about...
...you know... about...
Call a spade a spade, Fucking, Did she ever tell you about fucking?
Bobby!
Bobby, let's go home.
Come on.
- Do you know that Joyce masturbates?
She tries to do it with her friends.
How dare you talk of such filth in front of children?
I'm worried about the girl.
- Give me your hand.
I think you should have her come live with you. She's in the way at Mum's.
Her place is with her mother.
She's 14.
Now go away or I'll call the police!
Come on, Bobby.
I'm worried for the girl!
Hello, love. What are you doing here?
Dad, I have to talk to you.
You don't have a reputation to keep.
Pete's sake, Harold, don't listen to the	girl.
It's vicious gossip she's picked up.
You know how people talk.
You can't fool me. You're nothin' more than an old whore, carrying on with soldiers during the war.
Even your own daughter says you're a whore
Leading everybody a dog's life.
Dirty whore making out you're a saint!
Mum, I heard the front door go.
Hello, love. Fancy a cup of cocoa?
May I have a word, old man?
Right.
Harold, are you...
Have you... I want to know.
Have you been having intimate relations with my wife?
'Course not, Stanley.
Who told you that?
Better go, hadn't I?
Well... you've told me everything's all right.
So there we are.
I don't see why you can't stay.
As long	as you behave yourself like a gentleman.
All right, then.
- Very well.
I think I should tell you, um, I've talked to Mum.
And I think I made it all right between you. In the bed department.
You miserable little sod.
I don't need a pimp to make sexual arrangements between me and my wife.
I'm only tryin' to help.
- You're two a penny you are.
Calm yourself. You're going to have a fit!
Here, here. You see these boys here? You see these boys here?
Yes, yes.
- One of them is worth ten of you.
And most of them have been dead for thirty four years.
I did my bit, Stanley. - Your bit?!
You're nothin', you're nobody!
Even your own mother couldn't stand the bloody sight of ya!
He has gone to his sister's.
He's not well and cannot come.
What did you do to him, Harold?
Well, we can do without him.
Not on your wages, we can't.
Get the car.
We don't need him!
Who's going to pay for Joyce's new blazer?
Stanley may be partially limited, but he has always been an excellent provider.
Stanley's gone! He's left us to it!
And what are the neighbors going to make of that?
The Truth?
- Nobody wants the truth, Harold. nobody wants to be slapped in the face with our dirty linen.
The truth frightens everybody to death!
Scares the livin' daylights outta me.
I could happily strangle the lot o' you!
You're well enough to be up and about?
- It looks like it!
I took a day off work to bring them here on wild goose chase!
I suppose you said I hit you!
You must've hit him. He's got a bruise and a lump on the back of his head.
I won't hit you next time! I'll kill you!
Go for the police, Joyce.
- No! He said he'd kill us!
You harm one hair on my daughter's head, and I'll rip your bloody guts out!
You and whose army, peg leg?
- Get out! Get out!
And if you think I'm afraid of the police, I'll call them myself.
I'll have you for slander!
- Go home, Harold!
What makes you think she's your daughter?
Get out of here you filthy mongrel!
And you can go with him if you wish, Marjorie.
What makes you think I want to go anywhere with that delinquent?
I'm sorry this has happened Harold, we'll probably be back on Thurdsay
You'll have to be gone by then
Will somebody please tell me what that was about? I'm in the dark.
It's all right, Stanley. He's gone.
Give us a beer, Mom!
You, oi! Stop messin' about!
What the hell are you doin' here?
I just want to be friendly, Harold.
You could lose me my job.
I've got a good job here.
Why don't you come over tomorrow lunchtime while Stanley's at the pub?
Bring the car. We can have a picnic.
- Why can't you leave me alone, eh?
There's no need to worry about Stanley anymore.
That was over a fortnight ago. Don't ignore us, please.
We miss you. Please come home.
Look, I can handle Stanley.
Sod Stanley. I don't wanna come home.
Do you understand me? You're old enough to be my mother.
I thought that's why you liked me.
I never liked you. I like girls.
Nice girls with smooth faces.
Not grandmothers. Girls.
Children. Like Joyce.
Fuck off!
I knew you'd come, Harold.
Perfect timing. And I've done us a lovely picnic.
And Stanley's taken Princess with him, so they won't be bothering us.
You're looking peaky. Isn't he, Joyce?
Didn't sleep well, nor eaten.
Would you like a Bromoseltzer?
- I've had one.
In the olden days, as a cure for headaches people ate moss growing on the heads of criminals hanging from gibbets,
It's going to be a lovely day, I can feel it in my bones.
Ready? Here you are then.
Go on, get it.
Go on, bring it. Bring it here.
You! Hey! Come here! Come here!
Princess!
Come, Princess! Wh...! What the?!
Come, Princess!
What do you think about Grace
Kelly becomin' a Princess. Harold?
Didn't she look lovely in the newsreels?
Yes, but it's not like our royalty, is it?
One of ours wouldn't be able to marry an actress. It wouldn't be etiquette.
She did look beautiful though.
- Look at poor Princess Margaret Rose.
Now she's the real thing, of course.
But could she marry the man she loves? No.
And Grace Kelly is getting all the limelight.
Must feel like a slap in the face.
Last one.
Can I have a go? - No.
- Please, Harold.
Stop whining. You'd probably end up chop choppin' your fingers off or somethin'.
- Don't be stupid. I won't hurt myself.
Go and help your mum.
Why don't you go and pick some flowers?
I'm not a baby. I'm fourteen.
Go and pick some flowers, and let Harold do the fire.
Why don't you come and sit down,
Harold? I've done us a lovely spread.
We should do this more often.
We could go away together.
What about Joyce?
- Joyce will come with us.
Don't talk that rubbish.
You got me into trouble, Mum.
Now, you and Joyce have got me so messed up.
I spent last night in jail because of you.
I have to see the magistrate next week for.. for touchin' a girl at the swimmin' baths, and it's your fault.
You got me so low.
And it's got to stop.
What are you trying to say?
I'm telling you that if you don't stop worrying me for the sake of sex...
...then I'm goin' to the police.
I've already written the letter.
If you tell people I touched Joyce... they'll believe you after what I've done.
But I'm gonna show you the letters you sent me in the Army... begging for me, clamoring after me.
You won't be able to show your face in the street. You'll have to suffer that.
I'm going to beg for mercy from the magistr on Wednesday. i And if I'm lucky, if I'm able,
I'm going to go Yorkshire... to find my Jeannie, and beg her to take me back.
That's what I came to tell you.
Oh, Harold.
Your punctuation's terrible.
Got the message across though, didn't I?
Let's make this the last time.
For what?
You know.
No.
- Harold.
You know you want to.
There's a good boy.
You beast, Why can't you just leave Harold alone?
Jesus Christ!
Stay in the car, Joyce.
You've broken my jaw!
Shut up then!
Oh, Jesus. Oh.
Mustve cracked it.
It will all come out now. The whole mess.
The whole mess.
Help us, God.
Keep your head still.
That's it, keep still.
What are you going to do, Mum?
Stupid! Stupid! Bitch!
Don't hurt her!
Mum!
No! You killed my Mum! You killed my Mum! You killed her!
Harold Guppy was convicted for the murder Joyce Beasley.
He was sentenced to death.
The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
He was charged for the murder of Marjorie Beasley but this was never brought to trial.
BICYCLE THIEVES
Ricci?
Is Ricci here?
They called you.
Are you deaf? Come on!
So us bricklayers should just starve?
There's nothing I can do.
Be patient.
We'll try to help everyone.
That's what I'm here for.
We'll see what we can do.
Ricci, there's a job for you.
- A job?
You'll be putting up posters.
Go to their office.
Take this letter and your work permit.
- There's nothing for us?
- I'll be damned!
What about us?
I've just got jobs for lathe operators.
So I should just rot?
What can I do?
Ricci, don't forget to take your bicycle.
You need one.
It's says so on the slip, right?
My bicycle?
I have one... but not at the moment.
I'll have it in a couple days.
- You need one now.
What's it matter?
I'll go on foot for a few days.
Listen, you got one or not?
If not, someone else gets the job.
- I have one!
- You're not the only one. I do too.
You're a bricklayer.
That's a different category.
- Then change it!
- I can't!
You have a bicycle or not?
Yes.
I'll report for work this morning.
No joking around.
If you don't have a bike, forget it.
And wait around here forever?
I'll get the bike.
- Cataldi!
- Here!
- Manual labor for two days.
- I'll take it.
Listen, I can't make up jobs!
Maria!
- What is it?
- Do I have rotten luck or what?
There's a job, but I can't take it!
A job?
I don't understand.
What did you say?
Stop, Antonio.
What did you say?
A job?
And a good city job too!
It'll be all right.
Can't you work things out?
What's to work out?
I need my bicycle right now.
I have to start right away or I lose the job.
- What can we do?
- Nothing.
- You should never have pawned it!
- What would you have eaten?
I curse the day I was born!
- Quiet.
I feel like jumping in the river!
- Quiet!
Get up.
- What are you doing?
- We can sleep without sheets.
There are six sheets there.
Linen and cotton.
Good stuff. From my dowry.
- They're used.
Not all of them.
Two are new.
How many pieces?
Six.
Three doubles, three singles.
That's three.
7,000 lira.
Couldn't you make it a bit more?
They're used.
All right.
Put these in here.
Name?
- Maria Ricci.
Valmelaina.
Block H, Apartment 1.
It's a bicycle.
- Why?
- Interest. It's the 31st.
- Here.
It's the Fides.
Next to that red one.
I know, I know.
Wait a second.
Where's the man in charge?
Over there.
Put that down.
What are you afraid of?
Put that bike down.
Sorry.
My name is Antonio Ricci.
The employment office in Valmelaina sent me.
You start in the morning. The storeroom will give you what you need.
- Tomorrow at 6:45.
- I'll be there.
- How did it go?
- Good.
Sorry you had to wait, but it's all set.
- What's this?
- There's a job for you too.
You have to tighten the strap on my cap. It's loose.
Come look.
Everyone has his own locker.
See how big it is?
Just think: They used to even provide shoes.
But the pay's still good.
6,000 bimonthly, plus a family allowance.
And then there's overtime!
Can we stop at Via della Paglia?
- What for?
- I have to see a woman.
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.
Stop here a minute.
Who lives here?
I told you - a woman.
I'll just be a minute.
I'll be right back.
- Is it mine?
- No, it's mine.
That makes it five to three.
Concierge.
Excuse me.
Does the Holy One live here?
- The Holy One?
- The one who sees.
I don't know.
Let's try the second floor.
- Is the Holy One here?
- Yes, the last door.
Hey, kid, could you watch the bike for a minute?
Last door.
February, March and April have come and gone.
- How long has he been in bed?
- Over a year.
- You could have brought him.
- How? He can't move.
This one yes, that one no.
Dear God, grant me your light.
Your son will rise from his bed before the leaves fall.
Before the leaves fall?
Maria.
Come on.
Maria, let's go.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 lira.
Come on.
Don't be stupid.
She said you'd find a job.
I want to do my part.
- I'll come in and tell her what I think.
- All right, all right.
How can a woman with two children and a head on her shoulders listen to all this stupid nonsense?
I don't get it.
What are you doing now?
You must have money to throw away.
I don't know what got into you.
Women!
Couldn't you spend it better?
I'm just grateful.
You think she got me the job?
Come on. Get on.
Let's go home, dummy.
Hurry, Bruno.
It's 6:30.
It's too dark in here to clean it good.
- Daddy, look what they did.
- What?
- There's a dent.
- Maybe it was there.
No, they did it.
Who knows how they store them.
I'd have said something.
They don't pay for the repairs!
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.
But I'd have said something.
Is that cap ready?
- What did you make?
- Egg sandwiches.
Let me see. Wow!
- Handsome?
- You look like a cop!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Will you behave?
You'll wake the baby!
Here, Bruno.
An egg sandwich.
Let's go.
Bye, Mama.
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.
Good morning.
First, you give it a coat of glue.
Then you put up the poster.
Then another light coat of glue, flattening out the poster and smoothing out the lumps.
Got that?
Beat it, kid!
If you leave any lumps, the inspector will fine you.
You gotta be smart to do this job.
You gotta have a good eye and a quick hand.
There.
Let's go.
- See you, Ricci.
- Thanks.
Thief! Thief!
What happened?
Hop on!
After him, quick!
I saw him head for the tunnel!
Faster!
What's going on?
Well?
I was sure he came this way.
Yeah, sure he did.
Yes, there were people around, but I had to go after him.
Falloni!
- What is it?
- Go to the meeting.
Capece's going.
Change in plans.
You and Quadrone are going.
Sign this.
Quadrone!
We're going to the meeting.
Hurry up there!
- Can you do something?
- Look yourself if you've got time.
Look all over Rome?
Well, I sure wouldn't recognize it.
I gave you the serial number and a description.
Sure. It'd take the whole mobile unit to look for it.
Then why even file a complaint?
Suppose you find it tomorrow in a bike shop.
Call a policeman.
It's on file.
- Anything serious, Captain?
- Just a bicycle.
- Then it's up to me?
- I've already told you.
You filed your complaint.
Now good night.
Don't try cutting in line!
Excuse me, but I was here first.
Bruno.
Daddy, it's 7:30.
I took the bus. Let's go.
Where's the bike?
- Did it break down?
- Yeah, it broke down.
You go inside.
I'll be back later.
Go on.
It's not about the employment office.
Without work, people can't be placed in jobs.
We've raised this issue with the Department of Labor.
A welfare check solves nothing.
It just humiliates the worker and doesn't help anything.
We need a massive program of public works.
But what did they say at today's meeting?
The same as always:
"You can't expect miracles".
- Is Baiocco here?
- Quiet back there.
It was him!
"You can be sure we'll do our best to find you jobs".
Ricci, I'm stealing your job.
I'll be right back.
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.
- What is it?
- They stole my bicycle.
Son of a bitch!
Where?
At the Florida.
I was putting up posters.
How'd it happen?
You've got to help me.
I have to find that bike.
Easier said than done.
Excuse me. Baiocco, listen, or we'll be here all night.
I'm listening.
If you really cared for me
Quiet, everyone!
You wouldn't let people tease me
I heard you.
You think I'm stupid?
Keep rehearsing.
I'll be right there.
Piazza Vittorio's your only hope, and you gotta act quick.
They unload the stuff right away.
You just have to look there.
Antonio.
- Is it true?
- Don't start whining.
I purposely didn't go home to avoid that.
Who's whining?
But this doesn't happen every day.
Did you do something?
Did you look for it?
Don't cry.
You look like a little girl.
We'll find it.
They'll swap some parts, but it'll be on the market tomorrow.
And if it is, we'll take it home, right?
You might not sleep so well tonight, but we'll find it.
Don't worry.
Miss, would you care to take a stroll with me?
No, I'm with my mother.
No! This is either a rehearsal or a meeting.
You tell 'em, Meniconi.
- He's right.
Go home now.
We'll see what we can do.
- Until tomorrow then.
- Good night.
Remember what I said.
Good night.
Give her a little gas or we'll never get out of here.
Get that cart out of the way.
Baiocco, we're here.
Meniconi and Bagonghi, come here.
What make was it?
- A lightweight Fides, 1935 model.
He knows it better than me.
Good. That means we can split up.
They always take them apart.
Bagonghi, let's go this way.
No, this way is better.
You two look at nothing but tires.
You look at frames.
Bruno, pumps and bells.
Let's go.
- It's a Fides frame.
- Got it.
We'll look for it piece by piece and then put it back together.
Bagonghi, keep your eyes open.
There's only vegetables here.
We're not looking for that.
We'll stroll through the stands over there, not letting on what we're doing.
Indifferent to everything.
They're setting up now.
- Just look at this!
- He'll find it, I'm sure!
This really gets my goat!
Remember, Bruno:
Pumps and bells.
If you see anything, whistle.
You know what to do.
You come with me.
Bruno, if we find it, we'll celebrate.
Put that down.
Beat it, kid.
Keep your eyes peeled for a Fides.
Looking to buy, dummy?
- Let me work, or I'll give you this!
- Just try it!
You cranky this morning or what?
I'm in no mood for this.
Beat it.
I was here first.
You wanna fight?
We can't all stick together.
Antonio, you look for the tires.
Bagonghi, the frame.
The kid'll look for the pump.
I'll look around on my own.
Take a look at this frame.
Yeah?
- What make is that?
- You buying?
Hands off.
The paint's still wet.
I have to see the serial number.
Why?
You buyin' serial numbers?
No, he's not.
Now just show him.
- And if I don't?
- Then I'll call a cop.
Go ahead!
You think it was stolen?
Who said anything?
But you have to show the number.
Do I ask to see your shoe size? No!
And I don't show you my frame numbers!
- You play the lottery with it?
- No, I don't.
Wouldn't you like a bell?
You've been here looking for half an hour.
Shall I buy you this one?
How much is a bell?
- A hundred fifty lira.
Would you like it?
Just listen.
You filed your complaint.
You're covered.
Show him that frame.
Go ahead and look.
A man can't even work in peace.
Don't you trust me either?
Is it yours?
You got paint on you.
It's not a matter of trust.
A man who's been robbed has a right to look.
Who's stopping you?
We all make mistakes.
Hey, buddy, we're all honest here in Piazza Vittorio!
Forget about him.
Just look for a Fides.
- What do you think I'm doing?
- Where's my son?
- He must be over by the carts.
- There's nothing more for us here.
- It's tough.
How about something else?
Stay with me.
Come on.
Antonio, take him to Porta Portese.
We'll keep looking here.
Our chances are better here.
It's too late for Porta Portese.
Go on now.
Go with him.
Careful.
You just can't win.
It rains every Sunday.
Sundays I'm off at 1:00, and where can you go?
Movies bore me.
I just don't like 'em.
Look at this guy!
I ought to run him over!
Stupid jerk!
They jump out in front of you and you end up in jail before you even know what's happened!
Look at this rain.
You just can't win.
It rains every Sunday.
What happened?
I fell down!
Wipe yourself off.
- You afraid of rain?
- Don't want to get my tux wet!
- A hundred lira?
- You're lucky to get that.
What can I do with this?
Stop him!
Stop him! Thief!
Bruno, let's find that old man!
There he is, Daddy!
Damn it!
Where did he go?
Bruno, where are you going?
Bruno!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Excuse me.
I want to ask you something.
That young man who was with you - where can I find him?
What young man?
He talked to you and then rode off on a bike.
- Why? What did he do to you?
- Nothing.
It's an urgent private matter.
What can I tell you?
I don't know him.
You were together under the arches!
There are lots of young men under the arches.
Wait a second.
I have to talk to him.
Let me go!
Leave me alone, kid.
I'm just an old man who minds his own business, and what do I get? Trouble.
It's late! You're supposed to be here by 10:00.
- They said you were always open.
- Go on now.
- What about lunch?
- Later. You need a mess kit.
You first-timers, take your mess kits out into the courtyard.
Go ahead now.
There's no time to lose.
Line them up neatly, not like last time.
Each of you will come pick up your own mess kit later.
Maybe I should get a shave.
You need a shave?
Then come inside.
Sit down.
Go inside.
Will you be much longer, Counselor?
- No, just these two.
No, not me.
Then we can begin.
Don't shave my chin.
I'm letting it grow there.
Hurry, the priest's waiting.
That's enough now, Counselor.
You need another barber.
Come with me, little boy.
Move over, would you?
I have to find that young man.
It's a personal matter.
I have to talk to him.
Will you tell me where I can find him?
Just leave me alone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Page six.
"May I leave this holy place... with my soul purified..."
There's money in it for him.
Where is he?
- I don't have to say.
- You do too, or I'll get the police.
What have I done to you?
Leave me alone.
Lay off.
"Though I may travel once more the path of sorrow and hardship..."
Just tell me where he is.
What can you lose?
I've got nothing against you.
In fact, I'm prepared to pay.
- What's for lunch?
- Pasta and potatoes.
Will you tell me?
Jail is worse, you know.
You'll rot there.
Where is he?
- All right. Via della Campanella.
What number?
Ah, for chrissake!
I think it's No. 15.
- You're coming with me.
- Go by yourself.
No! You come with me or I call the police!
I'm tired of begging you!
You got that?
Quiet, or I'll have you thrown out!
Are you coming?
I'm not going anywhere.
- What have you got to lose?
- Go away!
- I'm losing my patience.
- Lose whatever you like.
Goddamn it!
Come along or I'm going to the police.
Do whatever the hell you like.
You're coming with me, you hear?
Leave me alone or you'll be sorry.
Come on, let's go!
I'm not going anywhere.
- I'll show you. Come on!
- Leave me alone!
- At least let me get my lunch first.
- I'm going with you.
Just when I can get a decent meal!
Stop them.
- Where are you going?
- To get this man's lunch.
Did a man come this way?
No, and we're not ready yet.
Girls, more over here.
Not so much there.
Just what do you want?
- I want to get out!
- It's locked, and the lawyer has the key!
Stop making such a racket!
You're in church!
Will you please just leave?
This is no way to behave in church!
Come with me!
Stop!
I have to find him.
I know he's here.
Did you come to hear mass or make trouble?
Just what do you want?
I told you:
I'm looking for an old man!
I've got to find him!
Where do you think you're going?
He came this way!
- Who knows where he's gone now.
- That's enough!
He didn't just fly away.
Why'd you let him go for his lunch?
Would you shut up!
Where are you going?
Come back here.
Come on!
You coming or not?
- No!
Let's go!
Some kid I have!
Come on!
- Why did you hit me?
- You asked for it.
Let's go.
- No. You go alone.
Will you come on?
Little troublemaker.
You're a little nag.
- I'm gonna tell Mama.
We'll settle this at home.
Wait for me by the bridge, you hear?
I'm gonna look for the old man.
Help! A boy's drowning!
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.
Bruno, put on your jacket.
You'll catch a chill.
Go ahead.
Come on.
Put it on.
You tired?
Sit down for a minute.
Not much we can do now but go home.
Sit down.
Go, Modena!
Is Modena a good team?
You hungry?
How about a pizza?
Let's go.
Why kill myself worrying when I'll end up just as dead anyway?
Come on.
Sit down.
Let's forget everything and get drunk!
Waiter.
Arrigo, help this gentleman.
A half bottle?
- A full bottle and a pizza.
- We don't serve pizza.
- You don't?
- This isn't a pizzeria.
- We want to eat.
- Eat?
- Yeah, eat!
- What do you want?
You want a mozzarella sandwich?
Two mozzarella sandwiches and a full bottle.
There'll be dessert later too.
How about that?
What's the matter? Drink.
If your mother saw me giving you wine!
But we can do as we like.
You can explain it this way
Or explain it that way
Call him Ciccio or Antonio
Beppe or Ciro
He's still a little black child
How could that have happened
Let's just eat and enjoy.
There's a cure for everything... except death.
To eat like them, you'd have to earn a million lira a month.
Eat, eat. Don't worry.
You like it?
Things were going great.
With overtime, I figured -
I'll show you.
12,000 a month salary.
Here, you write it down.
12,000 salary... plus 2,000 overtime... plus the family allowance.
Altogether, 800 a day.
Thirty times 800 - just imagine.
What more could you ask?
And I should just kiss it good-bye?
Well, I won't.
See now why we have to find it?
Otherwise we don't eat.
What can we do?
We'll go to the Porta Portese every day.
We'll find those guys there.
Yeah, sure.
Those guys are long gone.
We'd never find them with all your mother's candles or all the saints in the world.
Sports news.
Just like every Sunday, soccer teams throughout Italy will play their scheduled matches today.
Of course, fans are excited about the championship series.
Teams scheduled to play today...
Last door.
I'm afraid of what she might say.
Don't be afraid. Tell her everything, like you would your confessor.
I just hope you're right.
O holy Mother of God!
This one yes, that one no.
Sow in some other field.
You understand what I mean?
No, I don't.
How can you not understand, dear boy?
It's simple.
What good is sowing seeds if the soil is unreceptive?
You plant, but you harvest nothing.
Understand?
No, I really don't.
She doesn't love you!
Forget about her!
My dear boy, you're very ugly.
Very ugly.
There are so many other women.
Sow your seeds in a different field.
Will you do that?
Mama, it's getting cold.
Good day.
Daddy, come on!
There's room now!
You have to wait your turn.
Excuse me, but we've been waiting for hours.
- Why don't you wait your turn?
- I'm in a hurry.
Well, so are we.
Please understand,
I beg of you.
Behave yourselves.
Behave yourselves!
These ladies are first, and then me.
Stop arguing!
I shed my light on all.
This one yes, that one no.
Dear God, grant me your light.
Grant me your light.
What is it?
What?
They stole what?
- My bicycle.
Your bicycle?
What can I say, my son?
I can only tell you what I see.
Listen carefully.
Either you find it right away or you never will. Understand?
Either you find it right away, or you'll never see it again.
Find it right away?
But where?
I don't know what else to tell you.
Go now, and try to understand.
Find it right away or you never will.
Adele, what is it today?
My husband's still drinking.
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.
What can I do?
He takes it.
We're closed!
The ladies are having lunch!
Closed means closed for everyone!
Look here!
And with a kid too!
Don't you see you can't come in?
Get out!
You can't go in!
Where's he gone to now?
Get out of here!
Where's he gone?
Closed means closed for everybody!
- Where is he?
- How would I know? There he is!
You can't go in the rooms!
- Let me go!
- Scoundrel!
That's the dining room!
Get out of here!
Get out!
- I want to talk to him.
I don't even know you.
Well, you will.
Step outside.
Someone call the police!
Stop shouting.
I've got a headache.
- I want to talk to you!
- Me?
- Don't talk to him.
- Shut up.
You want me?
Here I am.
- Give me my bike back!
- Get your hands off me!
You ruined everything for me!
Get your hands off me!
I'm not afraid of you!
This is the finest house in Rome.
If the police chief should find out -
Outside with you, and don't ever come back!
Well, what do you want?
- Give me back what you stole!
- What did I steal?
Look at this guy!
What did I steal of yours?
My bicycle!
What bicycle?
I'm no thief.
- You're not going anywhere.
- Leave me alone or I'll flatten you!
I'll kill you if you don't give it back!
I'm not leaving here until you give it back!
Look at this crazy man!
Leave me alone.
Get your hands off me!
I didn't do anything.
You're trying to set me up.
I'm not leaving until you give back what you stole.
You stole my bike yesterday at the Florida!
I wasn't even there yesterday!
You were there with this cap!
- You can't just accuse people!
- Get some glasses!
- Leave me alone.
- No, I won't! You got that?
Alfredo!
What's that scoundrel want?
He won't let me go.
Hands off! I was at the general market yesterday.
Are you crazy?
You say this man here stole your bicycle?
Yes, he did.
- You're sure it was him?
- Of course I am!
- Where do you claim he stole it?
- Near the Florida.
Why not go to the police?
He lives right here.
Get the police.
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?
Get the police.
I've got nothing to hide.
You're not going anywhere, you hear?
Don't touch me!
Get him off me!
- You'd better go.
- Look what you've done.
- Be sure before you accuse someone.
- You won't get away with this.
His head!
Don't let him hit his head!
You better go.
And next time, be sure first!
Besides getting a good beating, you could be sued for libel.
Get him out of here or I'll kill him!
My boy!
Mama's pride and joy!
- Just go, will you?
- Get your hands off me!
Get your facts straight next time!
You already lost your bike, stupid!
Want to lose your wallet too?
Cowards, ganging up on one man!
You're all thieves!
- Are you crazy!
- Just trying to cool that guy down!
Where's this bicycle fellow?
There he is, putting on a show.
What show?
Can't you see he's half dead?
- Where do you live?
- Right there. I've got nothing to hide.
You can't accuse my son!
He's got a clean record!
They'll all tell you!
Just because he wears a German cap.
Isn't my cap German too?
- Get up.
- You can't move him!
Officer, he's very sick.
Then take me to your house.
For heaven's sake... we're honest people.
Come and see.
Come.
I'd sue you for slander.
That boy's never hurt a flea.
See for yourself.
Four of us live in this one room.
Here's his bed.
See any bicycles under here?
My two other kids and I all sleep there.
Instead of insulting my poor boy, you should give him a job.
He's always looking for one, bless his soul.
Those belong to my brother-in-law.
He used to have a car.
Sure, look under the bed.
You see any bicycles?
Listen.
Can anyone testify on your behalf?
- I'll testify.
You?
Could you step outside?
Take all day for all I care.
You could be mistaken.
You sure you recognize him?
Of course I'm sure.
Come here.
See all of them?
They'll all testify for him.
I see it every day.
Did you see his face?
- Yes, as he took off with it.
So you saw his back.
No, I saw his face, because -
- Were there other people around?
- Yes.
Did you get the names of any witnesses?
I couldn't stop to get names.
Then you're out of luck.
You didn't get a good look at his face, and you have no witnesses.
Maybe you're right, but you have no proof.
And if he is innocent, you're in trouble.
You have to catch these characters red-handed.
I'll smash his face in!
Then I'd have to arrest you.
If you only knew what this means to me.
Come here.
I feel better.
I can go with you now.
What did you find? Nothing!
I've got a clean record.
- What's your name?
- Alfredo Catelli.
You want to press charges?
My son's got a clean record.
That's right.
You'd better just leave.
Send us a postcard!
Coming around here to accuse people!
Bruno, come on.
Don't come around here again.
Bruno, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.
You heard me! Go on!
Thief!
Stop him! Thief!
Stop that guy!
Trying to ruin everything, are you?
This bike is all I have!
You're going to jail!
Beat it, kid!
- Where to?
- The police station.
We can't all go.
Pasquale and I will take him.
- Forget it. Let him go.
- Just like that?
I don't want trouble.
Thanks for your help.
You're a fine example for your son.
You should be ashamed.
You got off easy.
If it were me, you'd go to jail.
Go home now.
Beat it!
Get out of here!
And you can thank God.
You're late! Kiss me.
We're waiting!
The French franc keeps dropping, Baron.
Is it yes or no?
We'll soon find out.
This is me.
"A Prisoner of Love".
That's why you changed
"Man's Hope" to "expectations"?
Shit, the cinema!
36 CHARACTERS
IN SEARCH OF HISTORY
Expectations...
That's the word I'd like to write.
Modern life is too fast-paced to allow any room for a feeling so ardent, so tender.
We shrug our shoulders at this chaste betrothal with the future.
Modern man has no time to hope, nor to love.
It's the little people who hope.
Not the modern world.
Like the saints who atone and love for us.
Everywhere in our poor Europe, the tradition of modest expectations is in the hands of the poor.
Like old seamstresses, whose lace work no machine could ever match.
You'll say that these poor fools...
Living on expectations, are no more laudable for hoping than for living.
Probably...
Next!
Mr Vitalis, I'm Baron Felix.
"War is easy. It's..."
So is it yes?
What's your film called?
"The Fatal Bolero".
100,000 francs.
Go on.
1,000,000 francs.
Good thing I'm not serious or I'd think it over for another year.
"War is easy. It's sticking a piece of metal in a piece of flesh."
No, not at all!
Tonight at 10.
I booked a table at Edgar.
We're expecting you.
No, Father! It's not for you anymore.
You have to turn the page!
We'll start over after vacation.
I need to speak to you.
She sent me a letter.
You're lucky.
Yes, but I'm scared.
Too much of her brings me bad luck.
Will you be at your mother's for vacation?
Yes, Uncle.
I'm going to Madrid to get a book.
I'll come to see you before going to Paris.
- How old is it now?
- 35. You should know.
Either you're faithful or you aren't.
Each in his own way.
I was in Spain.
I found Azana's book about how Don Quixote was invented.
I haven't forgotten.
With the communists
I'll go to my death.
But I won't go one step further.
Something's wrong.
Is it her or is it him?
- You'll have to push.
- I'm tired!
I know, I know.
You saw Sollers' article in "Le Monde",
"Sarajevo and Marivaux".
Let's go by foot. It's not far.
She's given him the idea of going to Sarajevo to put on
"The Game of Love and Chance".
As if France needed that!
That screwy philosophizing daughter of yours!
He says he'll find a sponsor, if I lend him the car.
Can you imagine?
The car in which Albert Camus got killed drives on to Sarajevo.
I may have Corneille or Racine.
We said no tragedies!
How about Musset?
- "One Mustn't Play at Love"
- In Sarajevo.
I heard Musset was mean to George Sand.
Serves her right.
And what's more, Camille... that's me!
Happiness is such a rare pearl in this earthly ocean.
I know her. Three years ago, she wanted to deliver Jerusalem.
In the meantime, she's unemployed.
In Madrid, candles are forbidden in every church.
- What do they use?
- Electricity.
Good God.
- I agree.
- I don't.
"We begin by defending a Republic and end up robbing stagecoaches": Hugo.
I don't like guerillas, that ass Guevara, 2 or 3 Vietnams...
Yeah, Dad. 2 or 3 Americas.
Kings lunch, princes dine, paupers sup.
That's right.
So, who starts?
I, Albert Camus' granddaughter, decide to put on
"One Mustn't Play at Love" in Sarajevo.
It's suicide.
"Suicide is the only serious philosophical problem."
"The Rebel", page one.
To do so, I've asked the help and support of my cousin, here present.
Children were once parental property.
Yes, but when children are grand, they belong to their grandparents.
Say something.
No, he'll take his $100,000 for the "Fatal Bolero".
Ridiculous!
Shameful!
How horrible.
I have their word.
We'll never see that money.
This is what Juan Goytisolo told me in Madrid:
Is the history of Europe in the 1990's a simple rehearsal with slight symphonic variations of the cowardice and chaos of the 1930's?
Austria, Ethiopia,
Spain, Czechoslovakia: a dreadful, unending Bolero by Ravel.
Anyway, the war is over.
So what?
It was a civil war!
What you're saying is irrelevant!
Anyway, he's right.
What about the forests?
The fish? The wolves?
What's she talking about?
You heard me.
They'll rebuild it any which way.
No use voting green.
I'd like to go away.
With them.
It's not good enough here?
No, I'm not happy.
She can be Rosette.
There's nothing more to say.
Yes, there's more.
Now that I'm unemployed, during these slow, empty hours, a sadness rises into my mind from the depths of my soul.
Bitterness that everything is a sensation belonging only to me and also something outside me.
Something I'm incapable of changing!
Alas, life's a nightmare bad enough.
Leave our dreams out of it.
Articulate!
Yes, Uncle.
How often do my own dreams rise before me?
They represent what's most intelligent in the young generation, in this Europe, not purified, but corrupted by suffering...
To tell me how they resemble reality.
Not exalted, but humiliated by its new-won freedom.
...because I refuse them and they appear suddenly from the exterior.
You too, nothing but youth for sale.
Who's the father of characters in a play?
It was your idea to do theater there...
It's the author, Dad.
And who is the mother?
The actor.
Come with us... please.
I have to stop by Paris.
Listen to my idea.
Remember Hemingway's house?
My Lord,
I come to ask a favor of you.
The villagers to whom I spoke say you love your cousin and that you wooed me as a kind of joke.
You'll need some money.
I've saved up.
Like that?
Alas... let's go!
What were you talking about?
Do you mind telling me?
We were talking about our country.
He lives in Prague now.
His family was killed.
We were talking about death and about how you feel.
When it hits you?
Yes.
It's not like in books.
They use nice sentences, but it's not like that.
I told him what happens.
He agreed.
You don't feel anything, but you say something.
What?
Once I was run over by a police car.
There was an explosion. I fell.
I was lying on the sidewalk in a daze.
But I didn't think of dying.
There is no death.
There's only... me... who is going to die.
We're expecting you !
No, we're staying here.
Don't be stupid. It's cold.
No, we're staying here.
- At least come eat.
- We'll manage.
I'll be back later.
A room with a view.
Let's get to work.
What did he want?
What an ass.
Let's get to work.
Kings lunch, princes dine, paupers sup.
Not like that.
Words are words and kisses are kisses.
I realize I have little wit as soon as I open my mouth.
Let's get to work.
Tonight, philosophy.
Say something.
I think, therefore I am.
In "I think therefore I am," the "I" of "I think" is not the same as the "I" of "I am". Why?
The relation between body and spirit has yet to be shown.
Between thought and existence.
It's not funny.
I bit my tongue.
The sensation of I have of existence is not yet a "me".
It's an unreflected sensation.
It's born within me, but... without "me".
What are you up to?
Nothing, Uncle.
Is everything okay?
We're not tourists, Dad.
I'm asking because people are unhappier than we think.
And after all, there's no such thing as grown-ups.
What are you thinking?
I was wondering why I'm here... and what it means to be here.
Do you regret having come?
No.
Why do we ask such questions?
Why do we ask whether we exist or not?
I'm alive and I'm here.
Why is it dark at night?
Maybe the universe was once young like you.
And the sky was all ablaze.
As the world grew older, it grew farther away.
When I look at the sky through the stars,
I only see what has disappeared.
Tomorrow, Sheherazade.
I brought you a book.
A law of what?
There's a law of compensation.
Like with banks?
Balance, if you prefer.
Come on... for France.
Still no news?
A postcard.
It's three weeks old.
Justice always prevails. lf you have a wife and children, you can't write Hamlet.
I thought Shakespeare was married.
You've never read him! I have.
He missed out on some good stuff.
Defeat of intelligence.
What now?
I'm giving up. I'm tired.
Is Sarajevo far?
Just think...
That's all I do.
"I am but a living stage on which various actors do various plays."
Fernando Pessoa.
Yes. Remember his outline for Faust?
Act 1 :
War of intelligence against itself.
Act 2:
War of intelligence.
It's the Minister of War.
Of Defense, Sarah.
How's your book?
It's coming along,
Mr Minister of Defense... but not of the State!
Of the Republic!
Act 4:
War of intelligence against action.
Act 5:
Defeat of intelligence.
I see.
Very few people can see.
I hear, then !
Let's go.
Just another 300 kilometers.
One more cigarette.
Shit, he left!
Vichy wasn't the Republic.
But was the Revolution?
And its soldiers?
It helps to use the right words.
Harry, books are crimes.
"And as long as there are hacks
"who scribble away,
"there will be scoundrels
"out to kill."
Victor Hugo.
Your children are in Yugoslavia, right?
Her son and his cousin.
- What for?
- To put on Musset in Sarajevo.
With 17 empty theaters in Paris!
Are the poor kids having fun?
What do they hope to find?
A taste of freedom we're lacking here.
"Freedom? What for?"
You understand, this is France here.
There, it's America.
She's scared.
Remember those pilots.
We know they were tortured.
Tell her France will help if necessary.
I see a house!
What is she saying?
I can't hear!
She said:
"The poor will save the world."
Like us... poor asses.
They'll do it despite themselves.
Just try. Fight.
I saw a house. We're safe.
They'll do it despite themselves.
They'll ask for nothing in exchange.
They don't know the price of services rendered.
They'll accomplish this immense task.
Across the street, the Vietnamese made Kissinger yield.
The peace talks.
Nation against State.
You know what de Gaulle said of the French?
"They live in France.
France lives in me."
You owe me a favor.
I'll do what I can.
At this table, 40 years ago,
Rosselini finished "Pulcinella".
France won't help.
You say you love me.
And you never lie?
Never.
Yet this maiden has told me that you do.
What will you say to her,
Perdican, when she holds your words against you?
What did I do to make you cry?
I understand Alfred de Musset.
But all her talk about philosophy...
What's that?
Almost nothing or... something I don't know.
Something between the two.
Who is it?
What do you think?
What are we responsible for?
For what we do and for what we let happen when we can prevent it.
One's active and the other's passive.
Yes, of unequal importance.
Letting children starve to death, as we've done in Africa and elsewhere, is nothing to be proud about.
But killing one child is something else, something worse.
In the first case, you're responsible by default.
In the second, you're responsible by excess.
An excess of violence, of hatred.
Isn't an excess of evil worse than an absence of good?
Okay, once again :
One is never totally innocent of what one can prevent, but one is totally guilty only of what one does.
Is he still in love with you?
That's his problem.
I hope he isn't.
It's up to you.
"Philosophy is almost nothing," he told me.
"Or... something I don't know."
I see.
You need to have faith.
Like in Islam, or with your Christ.
No, that's not philosophy at all.
Let's get going.
I'm with the Red Cross.
Meet my secretary.
They speak every language here.
The International Brigade?
No, international brigands.
Where did we leave off?
Let's discuss the prisoners.
There are no more prisoners.
Their cigarettes are here.
The hostages, if you prefer.
France wants to know, Miss.
You know my name?
We saw you on CNN last week.
That's nice.
I'm bored. What can I do?
Go shoot your load.
How about the bank?
The hostages, please.
We need to interrogate them.
Laws are laws, even in wartime, Commandant.
He's a General!
What's the writing on the wall?
It's Cyrillic.
What does it mean?
Sarajevo, whore of the Occident.
Can we see them?
Overseas Geneva Bank Ltd.
It's time to work.
I'll be right back.
- I lose.
- Stand there.
Yes, sir.
Honor to Kasparov.
Lower your eyes.
Why are you laughing?
What did you say?
I said you look like Danton.
I told you so.
History professor?
No, philosophy.
Same thing.
Have you read Michelet?
Yes, sir.
Do you remember his description of the Committee of Public Safety?
I don't remember that.
They were third-rate writers and failed actors.
No one had slept for 3 weeks.
Everyone was crying.
Danton wasn't part of the Committee.
Articulate!
Danton wasn't in it.
He was Minister of Justice.
Turn around.
Bend over.
Lift up your shirts.
You too, Miss.
Oh, what we take up the ass!
Your grandfather?
He's your brother?
They're your sisters?
How about them?
What will it be?
Philosophy will be our girlfriend.
Forever.
Day and night.
Even if she loses her name.
Even in her absence.
A clandestine friend.
We respect what prevents us from getting close to her...
As we sense that we're not awake...
And that which is wakeful in us, even in our sleep, is due to her difficult friendship.
Farewell, Perdican.
I said to wear a skirt!
Yes, Dad.
Cinema replaces our gaze with a world in harmony with our desires.
Water! Only water!
No, it's no good.
Since I'm in the movies, all I do is wait!
I'm half an f-stop off.
He's the new runner, sir.
I'm asking what this is!
The location, sir.
What are you eyeing, asshole?
Nothing, ma'am.
A pack of Marlboros.
Yes, ma'am.
Stay here!
I'm studying cinema in high school.
Give him a script.
Go have a seat.
The poster.
It'll cost a fortune.
There's money in the sea.
The Hakim brothers taught me that.
What we need is a casino nearby and a school for Solange.
No problem.
Give me the figures.
- What is this?
- The location.
It's not natural.
Get something else.
Seriously... what's the problem?
Everything. There's not enough water.
It's all wrong.
I was told to keep expenses down.
Let's go.
I'll call the production office.
Don't forget the paychecks.
Who will the actress be?
We'll tell you later.
Here are the pictures.
They're all cows.
What do you think?
Why do cows always look so grumpy? lf your breasts were yanked on four times a day and you only got fucked once a year, you'd look grumpy too.
Have you read it?
Yes. In my opinion...
We don't want it!
I don't care about the story!
The title should be "Fatal Bolero" and the girl should die in a twister!
Yes, sir.
This must be why I've always felt a profound sadness in the cinema.
Both a possibility of expression and the trace of something essential, renounced.
Butt-fuck me, bastard.
Shove your cock up the bitch's ass.
Slide your dick up her butt.
Stick your prick...
Place your bets.
-So what's the news?
-Some good, some bad.
I'll be right back.
I found cheap actors.
He's here. He wants money.
Who are these people asking for money?
What have they done?
None of them has ever sent me a nice letter.
I'll sign two more, then it's over!
We still need... some cash, sir!
Show me that.
Place your bets.
Go sit down.
Did I spell it right?
No!
Place your bets.
Number 36, Baron...
You think so?
Like the Popular Front?
Exactly. Paid vacations.
Long live vacations!
Do your homework!
Number 36.
36, red, even, passe.
Godammit, piss up my crack, piss up my bung hole!
Give me a raise, Baron.
Butt-fuck me to death !
We found cheap actors.
Go away!
I need cash, sir!
See if they're still breathing.
You're crazy.
How horrible!
Not at all. Didn't Cocteau say:
"The cinema..."
That's right.
There's a woman in here.
A man in here.
We'll meet at the hotel.
Knowledge of the possibility of representation consoles us for being enslaved to life.
Knowledge of life consoles us for the fact that representation is but shadow.
No film stock.
- Since when?
- 3 weeks.
I'm half an f-stop off.
I'll take care of it.
We're not tourists.
Why "Fatal"?
There's no use. I can't.
Let's start over, Miss.
It's too hard.
It's because you're acting.
Acting weakens the text.
Acting removes its presence.
It sucks the blood out of it.
You've received money.
It's time to work.
When will you shoot the battle?
There is no battle.
The script!
How about page 121?
Ah yes... you're right.
There... It's done.
Lesson 32.
John Ford. Henry Fonda.
"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon".
I have an idea.
He has an idea!
Don't you care that I love you?
See you tomorrow.
- Can I come in?
- What for?
So I can teach you the rest.
- You're harsh.
- That's how I feel.
Because you've never suffered.
I've made mistakes... but I've loved.
I don't understand the "Fatal".
Can I ask him?
He won't answer you.
In a novel, a house or a person gets all its signification its very existence, from the writer.
Here, a house or a person gets a small amount of its meaning from me.
It's true signification is much larger. It's gigantic.
It is to exist here and now, like you and me, like no imagined character can exist.
Its immense weight, its mystery and its dignity arise from this fact.
The fact that I exist, me too, not like in a work of fiction, but as a human being.
Yes, Dad.
I knew it'd end like this.
Not knowing where to put the camera.
What do we do?
Put the camera in front of the actors.
Rolling!
"Bolero Fatal", 52.
Yes, there's more.
Now that I'm unemployed, during these slow, empty hours there rises from the depths of my soul and... into my mind, a sadness.
2.8 minus 1/4.
Yes, Dad!
We'll make it easier.
Just say the "Yes" at the beginning.
Yes... sir.
Perfect. That will do.
We weren't rolling.
We're reloading.
We have time.
What's the problem now?
I prefer to die.
Whenever you're ready, Miss.
I'm going to lunch.
I'm staying.
How horrible.
It's what I like in cinema.
A saturation of glorious signs, bathing in the light of their absent explanation.
I'm cold!
Fight, Miss.
I am fighting.
Let's go.
Okay.
You're better already.
Yes.
Okay, cut!
The sound's okay!
The camera too!
My master once said:
"I conceive of nothing as infinite.
"How can I conceive of anything as infinite?"
"Listen," I said.
"Imagine a space,
"and that beyond this space is more space,
"and farther on, there's more and more.
"It's never-ending."
"Why," asked my master?
I was stupefied.
"lf it ends," I shouted,
"what's beyond it?"
"lf it ends, beyond it is nothing," he answered.
My master was the only philosopher who was truly sincere.
What's going on?
We're ruined, honey.
They ran off with the money.
Where to?
Now I'll have to work.
No, we have the negative.
What's that for?
We'll make prints and open the movie fast.
It's in black and white!
No, it's in color.
Dumb bitch, it's black and white! lf it's poetry, I'll walk out.
We pay enough taxes as it is.
Look, we'll be able to buy your Omega.
Not an Omega.
I'm not in the Olympics.
Whatever you want!
Judging by that...
I'll end up with a Swatch.
Is your husband here?
It's Mr Felix!
Quiet. Keep working.
Does it start soon? lf it doesn't, I'm leaving.
It's in black and white.
I hope it's not poetry.
It looks like a winner!
Why "Fatal"?
It's the name of a war.
We lost many friends.
Your fucking movie is full of corpses?
- Not exactly.
- The cinema is all about waiting!
Shut up!
Sorry, kid. There are no tits!
Miss, you'll see.
What's the movie about?
The photography is gorgeous, you'll see, Miss.
Are there any boobs?
- No, no boobs.
- Any knockers?
Your grandmother used that word.
No knockers!
Get lost, dickwad!
Get that asshole out of here!
Beat it, little prick!
Let's go see "Terminator 4".
Come back, friends! Come back!
We'll change the movie!
Where's the mistake?
Mother and I told you, you have to turn the page.
Justice prevails.
I knew it.
Try it as a farewell to the tutti and an invitation to the solo.
It's another world.
Built up from nothing, then come back to nothing.
Let's begin.
Yes, Governor.
I prefer Wagner.
Not Wagner!
You'd hear him at the bottom of the sea!
Whereas Mozart...
It's gentle and light.
That's what people think.
Let's begin.
Yes, Governor.
Too many notes in Mozart.
That's what people think.
WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA
Starling!
Starling!
Crawford wants to see you in his office.
Thank you, sir.
- Clarice.
- Hey.
You looking for Crawford? He should be back in a minute. Wait in his office.
Starling.
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.
Sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
I hope so. They haven't posted any grades yet.
A job's come up and I thought about you.
Not a job, really. More of an interesting errand. Sit down.
Yes, sir.
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall, on the Bureau's civil rights record in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.
A-minus, sir.
Double major: psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.
It says, when you graduate, you wanna work for me in Behavioural Science.
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.
We're interviewing all serial killers now in custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.
See, the one we want most refuses to cooperate.
I want you to go after him again today in the asylum.
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.
Hannibal the Cannibal.
I don't expect him to talk to you.
But I have to be able to say we tried.
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.
How does he look? How does his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?
Here's a dossier on Lecter.
A copy of our questionnaire and a special ID for you.
Have your memo on my desk by 0900 Wednesday.
OK.
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.
Is there some connection between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used with him.
Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever.
And you're to tell him nothing personal.
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.
Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
And what is that?
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.
So rare to capture one alive.
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?
Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide.
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter and report back this afternoon.
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.
We've tried to study him, but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests.
Oh, my, does he hate us!
He thinks I'm his nemesis.
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman in eight years.
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts to pass you anything, do not accept it.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions.
On July 9, 1991, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.
His restraints were removed for an EKG.
When the nurse leaned over him, he did this to her.
The doctors managed to reset her jaw, more or less, save one of her eyes.
His pulse never got above 95, even when he ate her tongue.
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy, then maybe we'll have more luck if I go in by myself. What do you think?
You might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time.
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed the pleasure of your company, sir.
When she's finished, bring her out.
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the glass?
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can hang your coat up there if you like.
Thank you. I will.
He's past the others, the last cell.
You keep to the right.
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.
Hi.
I can smell your cunt!
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?
Certainly.
Closer, please.
Closer.
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm still in training at the academy.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.
Sit, please.
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.
He hissed at you. What did he say?
He said ''I can smell your cunt.''
I see.
I myself cannot.
You use Evyan skin cream.
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.
But not today.
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?
That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere.
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?
Memory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us your view on this questionnaire, sir.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You were doing fine. You had been courteous and receptive to courtesy.
You had established trust, with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.
And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.
Either you will or you won't.
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body.
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.
What a naughty boy he is.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.
It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide.
They said
''This one likes to skin his humps.''
Why do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling?
Thrill me with your acumen.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims.
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.
You send that through now.
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
No. I thought that your knowledge...
You're so ambitious, aren't you?
Do you know what you look like, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?
You look like a rube.
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube, with a little taste.
Good nutrition's given you length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you?
And that accent you've tried so desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.
What is your father, dear? Is he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?
How quickly the boys found you.
All those tedious, sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream of getting out, getting anywhere, getting all the way to the FBI.
You see a lot, Doctor.
But are you strong enough to point that high-powered perception at yourself?
What about it? Why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see?
Or maybe you're afraid to.
A census taker once tried to test me.
I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
You fly back to school now, little Starling.
Fly, fly, fly.
I bit my wrist so I can die.
Look at the blood!
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.
No, but I'll give you a chance for what you love most.
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.
I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!
Hey, Bill.
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.
You're dead, Starling.
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?
- The corner.
- Did you check?
- No.
- That's why you're dead.
3109. Breaking doors or windows to enter or exit.
Rule 404.
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.
- Starling?
- Sir?
Miggs is dead.
Dead?
How?
They heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon and Miggs crying.
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.
Look, I know it got ugly today, but you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.
Any follow-up on her?
Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patients' histories, so there's no record of anyone named Mofet, but
I thought the ''yourself'' reference was too hokey for Lecter, so I figured he's from Baltimore and I looked in the phone book and there's a ''Your Self'' storage facility right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.
Unit 31 was leased for ten years, pre-paid in full.
The contract is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.
So nobody's been in here since 1990?
Not to my knowledge.
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.
What about him?
I would ask my driver to help you, but he detests physical labour.
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.
If this door should fall down or anything else, this is the number for our Baltimore field office.
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.
Yes, Miss Starling.
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?
Hester Mofet. ''The rest of me.''
''Miss the rest of me.''
Meaning that you rented that garage?
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.
How did you...?
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?
You wanted me to find him.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail, a former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic.
I did not kill him, merely tucked him away very much as I found him, after he'd missed three appointments.
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.
His therapy was going nowhere.
His dress, make-up...
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.
I now just think of him as a kind of experiment.
A fledgling killer's first effort at transformation.
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?
Scared at first, then exhilarated.
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.
I never thought about it.
Do you think Jack Crawford wants you, sexually?
True, he is much older, but do you think he visualises scenarios, exchanges, fucking you?
That doesn't interest me and, frankly, it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.
Not any more.
Thank you, Barney.
What happened to your drawings?
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
What did you mean by ''transformation'', Doctor?
I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice.
I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive.
What I want is a view.
I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water.
I want to be in a federal institution far away from Dr Chilton.
What did you mean by ''fledgling killer''?
Are you saying that he's killed again?
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.
You know who he is, don't you?
Tell me who decapitated your patient, Doctor.
All good things to those who wait.
I've waited, Clarice, but how long can you and old Jackie Boy wait?
Our little Billy must already be searching for that next special lady.
MEMPHIS, TN
Hey, little cheeper.
I'll be right there.
Can I help you with that?
- Would you?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't get it up in the truck by myself.
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.
Just set it down. That's good.
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.
Push it all the way back.
- Is this good?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- OK.
Say, are you about a size 14?
Sorry?
Good.
Oh, good.
Good.
Starling!
Outside. Let's go.
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.
FBI!
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.
CLAY COUNTY, W VA
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.
No evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.
All the mutilation you see there is postmortem.
OK, three days. Then he shoots them, skins them and dumps them, each body in a different river.
The water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind.
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.
Her body was the only one he took the trouble to weight down, so actually she was the third girl found.
After her, he got lazy.
OK, let's see.
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.
He's a white male. Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups.
He's not a drifter. He's got his own house somewhere, not an apartment.
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength, combined with an older man's self-control.
He's cautious, precise...
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.
Why not?
Got a real taste for it now and he's getting better at his work.
Not bad, Starling. Questions?
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything about the information in my report or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.
He would have toyed with you then turned to stone.
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.
Agent Starling. We appreciate being invited into your jurisdiction.
I didn't call you. That was the state attorney's office.
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.
Know what I mean?
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished playing his music.
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.
I need a six-way linkup.
Chicago, Detroit...
What?
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen, listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.
I know that y'all brought her this far and her folks would thank you if they could for your kindness and your sensitivity.
But now please go on now and let us take care of her.
Go on now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
OK, good.
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.
Stand by for transmission.
Ray.
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.
OK, Starling.
Bill.
Star-shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum.
A muzzle stamp at the top.
Wrongful death.
She'll have to go to the state pathologist at Claxton.
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.
Lord Almighty.
What else do you see, Starling?
Well, she's not local.
Her ears are pierced three times and there's glitter nail polish.
That looks like town to me.
Two of her fingernails are broken off and there's dirt or grit under them.
It looks like she's tried to claw her way through something.
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.
Let's do another.
She's got something in her throat.
When a body comes out of the water, lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.
There's no way that could get way down in there.
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.
She'll be easier to print when we turn her over. Lamar, give me a hand.
Yes, sir. I will.
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed, this time in two large diamond-shaped sections above the buttocks.
Exit wound level with the second or the third thoracic vertebrae, six inches from the right shoulder blade.
Starling, when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.
- It matters.
- Point taken.
Ligature marks found around the wrists, not around the ankles.
This would indicate that the skinning was postmortem.
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.
Nice and slow, baby.
If the beetle moves one of your men, does that still count?
Course it counts. How do you play?
Agent Starling?
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.
It was found behind the soft palate of a murder victim in the Elk River.
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.
Boy, he's a big sucker.
OK. Let's check morphology.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Agent Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?
The amusing house wine?
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
Yes.
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.
Weird.
Better known to his friends as the death's-head moth.
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.
Here they'd have to be raised from imported eggs.
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey and nightshade, kept him warm.
Somebody loved him.
Where are you?
Let me outta here!
Help me!
Please!
Please help me.
Please!
Why won't you answer me? Please!
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.:
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, listed as missing, is now believed to have been kidnapped by the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill.
Police indicate that the girl's blouse has been identified, sliced up the back, in what has become a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.
Young Catherine Martin is the only daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, the Republican senator from Tennessee.
Her kidnapping is not considered to be politically motivated, but it has stirred the government to its highest levels.
Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont, the president is said to be, and I quote, ''intensely concerned''.
Just moments ago Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea.
I'm speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter.
Catherine is very gentle and kind.
Talk to her and you'll see.
You have the power. You are in charge.
I know you can feel love and compassion.
You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful as well as strong, that you're big enough to treat Catherine better than the world has treated you.
You have that power.
Please.
My daughter is Catherine.
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.
She keeps repeating the name.
If he sees Catherine as a person and not just an object, it's harder to tear her up.
Release my little girl.
You're coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me for the third time.
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.
Look, I am not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.
This is the number for the US attorney's office.
Either you discuss this with him or you let me do my job, do you understand?
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the senator promises you a transfer to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.
Maximum security still applies, of course.
You'd have reasonable access to books.
Best of all, though, one week of the year, you get to leave the hospital and go here.
Plum Island.
Every day of that week you may walk on the beach, you may swim in the ocean, for up to one hour, under SWAT team surveillance, of course.
And there you have it.
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.
A copy of the senator's offer.
This offer is non-negotiable and final.
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.
''Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Centre.''
Sounds charming.
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?
If I help you, Clarice, it will be ''turns'' with us too.
Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things.
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.
Go, Doctor.
What is your worst memory of childhood?
The death of my father.
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.
He was a town marshal.
One night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore.
They shot him.
Was he killed outright?
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.
My mother died when I was very young.
My father had become the whole world to me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.
You're very frank, Clarice.
I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?
- They all were.
- What else?
She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat.
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.
Was it a butterfly?
Yes. A moth.
Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.
Why does he place them there, Doctor?
The significance of the moth is change.
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa, and from thence into beauty.
Our Billy wants to change, too.
There's no correlation between transsexualism and violence.
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.
You're so close to the way you're gonna catch him, do you realise that?
No. Tell me why.
After your father's murder you were orphaned. What happened next?
I don't imagine the answer is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I lived with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?
Did he sodomise you?
No. He was a very decent man.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
You said that I was very close to the way we would catch him. What did you mean?
There are three centres for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota and Columbus Medical Centre.
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied for sex reassignment at all of them and been rejected.
On what basis would they reject him?
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.
He was made one through years of systematic abuse.
Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.
OK, OK.
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.
Now it places the lotion in the basket.
Please!
Please!
I wanna go home, please!
It places the lotion in the basket.
I wanna see my mommy!
Please!
I wanna see my...
I wanna see my mommy.
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!
You still think you're gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies?
I don't think so.
I called Senator Ruth Martin.
She never heard of any deal with you.
They scammed you, Hannibal.
Stand outside.
And shut the door.
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well.
Identify Buffalo Bill by name and, if the girl is found in time,
Senator Martin will have you transferred to the state prison in Tennessee.
Answer me, Hannibal.
You answer me now or, by God, you'll never leave this cell.
Who is Buffalo Bill?
His first name is Louis.
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself, but only in Tennessee.
And I have a few conditions of my own.
Clean him up and get him ready to go.
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's being transferred to Memphis.
Transferred?
Did you have a trainee make a phoney offer to Lecter in the senator's name?
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.
You be a gentleman, you're gonna get three hots and a cot.
Sir. You sign right here, we'll have us a legal transfer.
Where's...?
Here, sir. Use mine.
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights.
You'll wanna read it before I sign.
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time, bargaining for petty privileges.
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.
I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl.
Let me help you now and I will trust you when it is all over.
You have my word. Paul?
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.
I met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May 1990 by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.
They were lovers, you see.
But Raspail had become very frightened.
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient and done things with the skin.
We need his address and a physical description.
Tell me, Senator. Did you nurse Catherine yourself?
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!
Amputate a man's leg and he can still feel it tickling.
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?
Take this thing back to Baltimore.
Five foot ten, strongly built, about 190 pounds.
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied.
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.
And, Senator, just one more thing.
Love your suit.
In a meeting this evening with Senator Ruth Martin,
Dr Lecter agreed to assist in the investigation of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?
That is now a matter of record with the proper authorities.
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.
I understand, sir.
Log in and check your weapon.
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department, people at the FBI, folks at the Baltimore state hospital.
And now for the hard part: apprehending the suspect.
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.
Is it true what they're sayin'?
He's some kind of vampire?
They don't have a name for what he is.
You do know the rules, ma'am?
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.
Go ahead.
Good evening, Clarice.
I thought you might like your drawings back, Doctor.
Just until you get your view.
How very thoughtful.
Or did Jack Crawford send you for one last wheedle before you're both booted off the case?
No, I came because I wanted to.
People will say we're in love.
Anthrax Island.
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Yeah.
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.
Louis Friend?
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.
Oh, Clarice, your problem is you need to get more fun out of life.
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.
I've read the case files. Have you?
Everything you need to find him is there in those pages.
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask what is it in itself?
What is its nature?
What does he do, this man you seek?
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?
Anger.
Social acceptance.
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?
Do we seek out things to covet?
Make an effort to answer now.
No. We just...
No, we begin by coveting what we see every day.
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?
And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations to sell.
Why did you leave that ranch?
Doctor, we don't have any more time for any of this now.
But we don't reckon time the same way, do we?
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...
No. I will listen now.
After your father's murder, you were orphaned.
You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.
And?
And one morning I just ran away.
Not ''just'', Clarice. What set you off?
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?
I heard a strange noise.
What was it?
It was screaming.
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.
What did you do?
I went downstairs.
Outside.
I crept up into the barn.
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?
Lambs.
They were screaming.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
And they were screaming.
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.
I opened the gate to their pen, but they wouldn't run.
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.
But you could - and you did, didn't you?
Yes. I took one lamb and I ran away as fast as I could.
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food, any water and it was very cold, very cold.
I thought...
I thought if I could save just one, but...
He was so heavy.
So heavy.
I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriff's car picked me up.
The rancher was so angry, he sent me to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.
I never saw the ranch again.
What became of your lamb, Clarice?
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?
Wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs?
Yes.
And you think, if you save poor Catherine, you could make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark ever again to that awful screaming of the lambs.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
Dr Chilton, I presume.
I think you know each other.
OK.
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.
- Out.
- Tell me his name.
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have to put you on a plane. Come on now.
Brave Clarice.
You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.
Your case file.
Goodbye, Clarice.
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.
Same drill as before, please.
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.
OK.
Hand me that, would ya?
Thanks.
Mind the drawings, please.
Thank you.
Watch it. He's cuffed me!
Jesus Christ!
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.
What is this shit?
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: shots fired on five.
Sergeant Tate.
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...
Look!
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.
Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance double-quick.
We're goin' up.
Pembry!
Boyle!
Oh, God.
Go.
- Clear.
- Command post.
Two officers down.
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.
He's stripped the bed. Might be makin' a rope. Check all windows.
Where the fuck is my ambulance?
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.
Get a hold of him and feel his hand. Talk to him.
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!
Lecter is missing and armed.
Pembry, can you hear me?
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.
You look real good.
Yeah, you look real good.
- You ready?
- Let's do it.
Let's go.
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna make it. You're doin' just fine.
I need that IV now!
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?
Stay with me. Stay with me here.
We're losin' him. Downstairs.
And up.
Elevator!
CP to Tate.
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.
He seems to be hangin' on.
Top three floors secured.
Main stairwell secured.
We think he's on two.
Tate, are you still with me?
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir. That's all for now. Over.
He's on the roof of the elevator.
OK, guys.
I see him.
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.
- One warning: we need him alive.
- Got it.
Lecter, put your hands on your head.
One in the leg.
No movement.
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.
We're openin' the hatch.
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.
- Affirm.
- Got it.
Memphis General, medical unit 26.
We're inbound with a male police officer with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 94.
We got him on lactated Ringer's and the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...
They found the ambulance in a parking garage at the airport. Crew was dead.
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?
- He won't.
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.
The thing is that Lecter said everything we need to catch him is in these pages.
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.
He's here, Ardelia.
Is this Lecter's handwriting?
''Clarice, doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random, like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter.''
Desperately random?
What does he mean?
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.
But there is no pattern or the computers would have nailed it.
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.
From Belvedere, Ohio.
First girl taken, third body found.
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.
What did Lecter say about the first principles?
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.
How do we first start to covet?
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.
BELVEDERE, OHIO
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.
I sure appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr Bimmel.
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.
Police been back here so many times already.
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus to see about a job.
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.
Her bedroom's how she left it.
Upstairs. Door to the left.
He's making himself a ''woman suit'',
Mr Crawford, out of real women.
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...
That's why they're so big. He has to keep them alive so he can starve them,
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.
That's great news, sir, but how...
Johns Hopkins came up with some names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a John Grant.
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.
Customs had some paper on him.
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.
Starling, we wouldn't have found him without you.
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.
Mr Crawford?
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.
Precious!
Come on, girl!
Come on, Precious.
Come on, Precious!
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.
Precious!
Are you up there, you little shit?
Come and get it, pretty girl.
Precious, please come. Come on.
Would you fuck me?
Come on. Take that bone.
I'd fuck me.
Come on.
I'd fuck me hard.
I'd fuck me so hard.
No.
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?
Sometimes you do.
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job at the bank.
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day.
She thought it was such hot shit.
What did she know? Big dummy.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?
- How about John Grant?
- No.
Would she have had a friend you didn't know about?
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.
CALUMET CITY, IL
So powerful. So beautiful.
Precious?
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.
Poodlie-poo. Precious.
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.
She broke her leg on the way down. I know it.
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!
You don't know what pain is!
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!
I'm gonna do it, mister!
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!
OK, I'm coming.
We're goin' in.
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.
FBI! Everybody down!
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.
Clear!
What's the problem, officer?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel.
There's no one here, Jack.
Clarice.
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?
No. Uh-uh.
Oh, wait.
Was she a great, big, fat person?
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...
No, I read about her in the newspaper.
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.
Are you close to catchin' somebody, you think?
Yes. We may be.
Did you take over this place after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?
Tax forms? List of employees?
No, nothin' like that at all.
Say, has the FBI learned something?
The police around here don't seem to have the first clue.
I mean, have you got, like, a description, fingerprints, anything like that?
No.
No, we don't.
Here's that number.
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?
Sure, you can use my phone.
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.
And turn around. Spread your legs.
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.
Freeze!
Hello? Are you there?
I'm down here!
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!
FBI. You're safe.
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.
Just get me outta here!
Oh, my God.
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there, but right now you listen to me.
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.
No! Don't you leave me here, you fuckin' bitch!
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!
Please!
I gotta get outta here!
Catherine, the other officers'll be here any minute now.
Wait! Don't go! Please!
Quiet!
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?
Clarice M Starling.
Congratulations.
Special Agent Starling.
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.
- Excuse me.
- Starling.
Pilch, could you take our picture?
Yeah. Sure.
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.
I'm not much good at this kinda thing, so I'm gonna duck outta here.
OK. Sure.
Thank you, Mr Crawford.
Your father would have been proud today.
Don't forget your phone call.
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?
Have the lambs stopped screaming?
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.
I won't be on long enough.
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.
The world's more interesting with you in it.
So you take care now to extend me the same courtesy.
You know I can't make that promise.
I do wish we could chat longer but...
I'm having an old friend for dinner.
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?
Dr Lecter?
Excuse me. You got the security system all set up?
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
Visiontext Subtitles: Sally Lewis
Nina?
Want me to move this camera stuff?
No, l'll get it.
Thanks.
When are you giving
Marvin back his ring?
Just curious.
Girl, please. l would if l knew where the hell he was.
Or maybe l'll just keep it as a reminder... never to make the same mistake twice.
Get engaged?
No. Falling in love.
That shit is played out like an eight-track.
Hello.
Don't leave me hanging, please. l'm sory.
Thank you. A cynic is born.
Hello, hallelujah.
We are talk nappy head. l mean, really, really, talk nappy head. l ain't talking, talking of them tediously talk tone... or tortuously tangled and talked-up tongues.
But can you speak to me... in the language of divinity... with your miracle of ritual... and spiritual drum?
Can you do, do to me... and then just bail me?
Do, do to me and then commitment me?
-Am l talking to you?
-No. Your discussing me.
-Am l talking to you?
-Why is she like that?
Sheila, what you need is a man to converse with.
Excuse me, Ed... but l have a man, thank you.
-But where is he?
-He's not here. l know what you need, girl.
You need some romance in your life.
And l'm sure you're an expert on that.
Yes, indeedy, l am.
Wood, you are the least romantic man l know. l think that l am Mr. Romance. l believe in that shit like flowers... candy, all that.
Just not evey day.
That's not me.
That's what l'm talking about.
You know what l'm saying?
Can we... love?
Romance is dead... is what they said while sitting around cheating at pool.
At the vey last frame of this nine-ball game... the cat who had the date on the top of the Empire State... is the one who got hustled like a fool.
You watch too many movies,
Sheila.
Step off, Ed, all right?
What's up?
Romance is about the possibility of the thing.
You see... it's about the time between... when you first meet some fine-ass woman... and when you first make love to her.
And when you first ask a woman to mary you... and when she says l do.
When people who been together a long time... say that the romance is gone--
Mm-mmm.
What they're really saying is... they've exhausted the possibility.
Von.
Now you talking about my thing.
You and me, bro. lt's like poety... is the possibility of language.
Please, give me a break.
-Where you want it at?
-Von, let me get my lighter.
No, l said Savon.
What's wrong with you? l don't know what's wrong with that girl.
He doesn't need to be smoking.
Thank you, Moms.
You're welcome. l thought we left our mothers at home.
-Do you want another drink?
-Actually, l am OKfor now. l'm getting one. l'm bringing you one, anyway.
Thanks, 'cause l'm gonna hit this off quick.
Hey, Will,
Iet me get another one, man.
Cool.
White wine, please.
Who's that girl with Darius?
Damn.
She does have a little somethin' somethin'.
-Excuse me, Mr. Married Man.
-l am married. l am not blind.
Can you see through these, please?
Eveything is checking out.
That's what l'm talking about.
Niggers, this ain't right.
-Niggers?
-Why we got to be that?
Because that's what you are.
Deep in thought, huh?
What are you thinking about?
A woman l saw once.
She must've been fine.
Savon, you can't tell me that these babes... can't see that cool pose shit coming a mile off.
You know, brother, jealousy is a sickness.
Let it go, man.
Let it go... and just walk away.
Fuck you, Ed.
Darius Lovehall.
Nina Mosley.
Fumble. Just like l told you.
Excuse me.
Why don't you put this on your tab?
You put that energy out there.
That's a fumble, bro.
-Anybody in here can see that.
-Oh, please.
-Sory about that.
-Here you go.
Ty not to knock this one over.
Maybe you should quit smoking.
All right, all right.
Get settled. We're back.
And this next brother up on the mike... writes for New City... and is regularly here on Monday nights.
So please, give it to Mr. Darius Lovehall.
Brother Ed.
All right, this is... a little something l been working on. lt's new. l call it...
''A Blues for Nina.''
Yeah, baby. Go to it, now.
Take your time.
Say, baby... can l be your slave? l've got to admit, girl, you're the shit, girl... and l'm digging you like a grave.
Now, do they call you Daughter to the Spinning Pulsar... or maybe Queen of 10,OOO Moons?
Sister to the Distant
Yet Rising Star? ls your name Yemaya?
Oh, hell, no.
It's got to be Oshun. ls that a smile at me put on yourface, child... wide as a field of jasmine and clover?
Talk that talk, honey.
Walk that walk, money.
High on legs that'll spite Jehovah.
Shit.
Who am l? lt's not important.
But they call me
Brother to the Night.
And right now... l'm the blues in your left thigh... tying to become the funk in your right.
Who am l? l'll be whoever you say.
But right now l'm the sight-raped hunter... blindly pursuing you as my prey.
And l just want to give you injections... of sublime erections... and get you to dance to my rhythm... make you dream archetypes... of black angels in flight... upon wings of distorted, contorted... metaphoric jizm.
Come on, slim.
Fuck your man. l ain't worried about him. lt's you who l want to step to my scene.
'Cause rather than deal with the fallacy... of this dy-ass reality... l'd rather dance and romance your sweet ass in a wet dream.
Who am l?
Well, they all call me
Brother to the Night.
And right now l'm the blues in your left thigh... tying to become the funk in your right. ls that all right?
That's all right, baby.
Bravo.
Darius Lovehall.
Wonde_ul.
Absolutely wonde_ul.
No. Come on now, Wood.
Give him his props for that one.
You got to give it up, Wood.
Come on.
Yeah, whatever. l'll tell you one thing. l don't need poety to get women.
No. You need a personality to get women.
Ty a breath mint and a Visa.
Played out like an eight-track.
You did say that, didn't you?
Here come your boy.
-Y'all like that, huh?
-Great poem.
That was fascinating.
-Look at Ed.
-Who's Nina? l loved it, Darius.
Green glob just coming all out your mouth.
You don't know me like that.
We need to embrace this brother.
You're a bad influence.
Especially you.
You're the worst influence of all.
Don't even ty it.
Thanks for my poem. lt was... interesting.
No problem.
Eveybody, this is Nina.
Sheila, Ed...
Savon, and that's Hollywood.
This is my girl Josie.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
So maybe next week you can write something for me.
Maybe... but it won't be about sex.
What's wrong with sex?
There's nothing wrong with sex.
There's just other topics.
Like what?
But you probably wouldn't know anything about that.
Good night, black people.
-Good night.
-Good night, sister.
Oh, ho-ho, man.
Well, damn.
Yo, man, if that was me... l'd be in her car right now.
You know? Be gettin' that.
You got your hands pulled there.
Maybe if your hand was bigger she could write her number down.
Close your mouth, D.
Y'all just mad
'cause somebody approached me.
What is the secret?
Come on, Darius!
Oh, pookie, come on, man.
Yes. Come on, more.
More. Bigger.
Yes! That was the cover.
Now.
This isn't curried chicken, and they were out of baguettes. l'm sory.
Roger, come on, give me a break.
This is only lunch. lt isn't about the bloody lunch, Nina. l don't think this assistant thing is working out. l suspect you don't have the temperament for it.
Perhaps you'd be better off on your own. l'm heading back over to the office... get the rest of my things. l can't believe l'm finally up out of there.
But y'all don't wory about me. l saved up enough cash to hold me for a while.
Cool. Just hook us up in the book dedication.
Look, just because you been there for me... when the times l needed you... don't mean l get to put you in my book, all right?
No shout-outs, baby.
No shout-outs.
How you doing?
Girl, l need an Isley Brothers CD badly. l hear you.
The CDs are in the back.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Yo, She. What's going on, girl?
-What's happening?
-Not much.
Y'all slow as hell up in here today.
But it'll speed up.
What you talking about?
Aw, shit.
Hey, would you hold this for a second?
Why you gonna give me your junk?
Just be cool.
Ah, Al Green.
You can't go wrong with my man Al Green.
Darius, right?
You mind if l play you a little something real quick?
Last time you went on an impulse... you embarrassed the shit out of me.
Look, this'll be easy. l promise. Watch.
Charlie Parker. l've never heard this particular-- lt's kind of sad.
Melancholy maybe, but not sad.
There's a difference, l think.
Maybe you're right.
My new information's on there.
OK. Great.
Here you go.
Dr. Wax will have that Isley Brothers CD.
-Thanks. See you later.
-All right. Bye-bye.
Say, you know, you and l should... get together sometime and have some drinks. l don't think that'll be a vey good idea.
Well, why not? lt's just bad timing.
Nothing personal. l understand.
Thanks for the record.
Damn.
Messed that shit up.
When are you gonna learn?
You move too fast.
See, women like it slow and easy.
Didn't l school you?
Why don't you let me get her address real quick?
How would l do that?
'Cause it's on the check, man.
Why would l do that?
You're my girl. You're supposed to be looking out--
Stop playing and hook me up.
-l'm not playing. No.
-Why?
Look, what if her man comes to the door?
Her m--
Her man.
Damn, l didn't think about that, man.
Yeah, you right. l'm buggin'.
What are you doing here?
How'd you know where l live? l know it's a little strange... for me just to show up to your place like this.
What did you do, follow me?
No. Nothing like that.
Well, actually, l... l got your address from the check that you wrote... down at the record store.
Look, l know that that wasn't vey cool... and l apologize... but l got that CD you were looking for. lsley Brothers, right?
This is the one. Thanks.
No problem.
What, you tying to come in?
Yeah--l mean, no! No, no.
Yeah, if--Sure, l mean... if you're not busy or doing anything.
You can come in.
-You sure?
-Yeah. l hope l'm not intruding.
Nice little pad you got here. l'm just house-sitting.
Oh, a photographer.
Dig that. It's nice.
Why are you here?
You said it was bad timing.
And l figured if l asked again, maybe you'd say yes. lf not that time, then maybe the next time... till the next time became the right time.
Persistence.
Be surprised how far it can get you.
Reminds me of stuff Gordon Parks was shooting for Life magazine.
Do you know a lot about photography?
A little somethin' somethin'. l know you have a great eye.
So you're just like a-- a Renaissance black man.
Poety, music, photography.
Think it was somebody that said something about Mozart.
''The goal of an artist is to create the definitive work...
''that cannot be surpassed.''
Guess you can say l kind of live like that.
Well, that was actually
George Bernard Shaw.
Now you're tying too hard. l'm beginning to like this.
Well, don't like it too much.
Check it out.
Couple friends of mine are having this get-together... tomorrow night. l want you to come hang with me.
Maybe we can start to like this together.
So, what, are you asking me out on a date again? l guess that's about the size of it, yeah.
So? l don't know--
Aw, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't make me start bringing more CDs up here, OK?
'Cause l'll start bringing you
Prince CDs.
And you know how that brother like to pump out... four or five albums a week.
-Oh, please.
-l'll be up here evey day.
OK, all right, l'll save you the trouble. l'll just come by about $:15 tomorrow and get you.
Cool. Hope you enjoy your CD.
Thanks.
The next time you decide to just stop by... you should call first.
'Cause l know you wrote the phone number down.
You right. l got your number.
The last time we was over here... no disrespect, the food was crazy.
The constant and annoying references... to my wife's cooking--
Hey, Troy. Hey, Troy.
What you got?
Don't be talking about me with your microwave-cooking ass.
And then she gonna come out here with carrots.
Do l have two big front teeth?
There somebody hopping?
Get some beta carotene up in you, bro.
You can't see as it is.
Fuck y'all.
Got to bang out some wickedness out of you, boy.
We're going to get something going up in here.
Don't start it up.
Come on now, Savon.
Get back. Exorcise that.
Come on, man.
No, she--
Get over there!
Get out of here.
Quit fucking around with them spirits.
You'll get eveybody up in here pregnant.
You'll fuck around and get us pregnant.
Take that shit to Flint.
Baby, Flint get it all.
Don't wory about Flint.
He can keep it all.
You scared?
Scared of what?
God. l know Jesus.
God is a woman, honey.
Uh-huh, all righty then.
No, hold up, hold up.
God is a woman.
Look, D, me and Ed.
You know what l'm saying?
We with you and eveything, but damn. lf you ever chased a woman... then you know that women have a certain power... a certain sexual thing... that renders men totally incapable of functioning.
-Am l right, Von?
-That's Right.
-lt drives us to distraction.
-That's right.
Destruction.
Look at that kitchen.
Go look in that kitchen.
Exactly, exactly.
A male God wouldn't allow... a creature in his own image to get jammed up.
Wait. Excuse me... but why are you tying to impress your date?
'Cause you know you wouldn't even believe that.
You know he's just telling the truth.
Yo, Savon... why don't you break it down for those who don't understand?
Break it down for them, bro.
Hold on. Hold up.
Let me break it down... so it can forever and consistently be broke.
All right?
Now when a man gets a hard-on... you know where the blood comes from, right?
His brain... and his feet.
True.
So A: He's stupid.
And B: He can't run.
Only the woman God... thinks up some shit like that.
That's how she got you, right?
That's it.
That's what happened.
Nah, see, that's some bullshit.
'Cause l got it down. l figured it out.
This has become a regular forum.
What? l'm for real!
We getting ready to have some Hollywood philosophizing? l can't wait.
Think about this--anatomy.
Now, if God was really a woman--
Y'all know how God think.
She'd put the dick right under the chin.
Take care of her business.
You are sick!
Why?
You're out.
And get new chips, man.
Y'all sure know how to treat a person.
Let's go home. l was 15, and my dad gave me this old Topcon... when he was in the navy... and ever since then l've been hooked.
You shoot.
What you know about writing? l gather up each sound you left behind... and stretch them on our bed.
Each night, l breathe you and become high.
Check you out, girl.
That's yours?
No. Sanchez. l'm a lifelong fan.
She makes me want to burn my notebook.
See, it's about reaching your level, not hers. l thought it was about the definitive work.
Yeah, well, Mozart was the exception, like Bird.
You have all the answers, don't you?
Mm-mmm. Solid questions.
Cocky. lt's cute.
Ah, ''cute.''
So, check it out.
You like reggae music?
Let's go up to the Wild Hare. l wanna see the little
Yankee girl dancing tonight.
You want to drive all the way up to the north side?
Tonight, mon. Me want to feel a little bump and grind.
What if it starts raining again?
Aw, now don't tell me... you're afraid of getting a little wet tonight.
No one fits your shoe
And l'm so proud to tell you
You're number one
You have earned it l've had lots and lots of pretty girls ln my traveling all around the world
No one comes close to you
And if you should count from one to ten
You'll find them at the vey end
And it's because l've been telling you
That's why you are my lady l'm crazy about you, baby
And l'll never, never, never
Never stop loving you l'll never stop loving you
Oh, baby
-Thanks.
-No thing. l had a really good time.
My pleasure. l'm sory.
Look, l should go.
Darius, look, l had a really good time. l really did. lt's just that l can't go out like that on the first date. l understand.
We just got a chance to know each other. l understand you.
Wait. l should go. All right?
Yeah. 'Cause... lt's getting late, so... maybe l'll call you.
-OK.
-That's cool.
-Thanks.
-Good night.
Look, Nina... l just want to come up and talk. ls that all right?
Come on.
Good morning. l see you... found your way to the kitchen.
Oh, yeah. Hope you don't mind.
Nah. It's cool. l got some omelets happening.
This is for me?
Yeah, this is for you.
Thank you.
Look... l really dig you, Nina... and l hope we didn't move too fast, you know?
Nothing happened that l didn't want to happen. ls that a good thing or a bad thing? lt's a great thing.
Cool.
So... guess we can hook up again, right?
Wait a minute.
You ain't gonna fake me out, are you?
Good. l tell you... l can't stand to sleep with a woman... and afte_ards she just dog you out.
You know how you all do.
Don't return any phone calls... play me off in front of your friends... like you don't know me... like nothing ever happened.
Look, l'm gonna get myself an omelet.
You want anything else?
Don't ask that question.
Would you... like anything else?
What you gonna do?
You gonna have him or what?
Girl, please. l--No. l would hurt him too badly.
You fucked him, didn't you?
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
You ain't slick.
You can't keep that kind of shit from me. l can't believe you fucked him on a first date.
How?
Girl, how?
Slap happy.
Girl, l didn't plan to. lt just sort of happened.
You just sort of slipped and fell on his dick.
Well, all right.
OK, OK, OK.
So l want to know all the details.
How big, how long, eveything.
Girl, look at you.
Well, unfortunately, l have to live vicariously... through your sex life,
Miss Nina.
All right. OK. l can't ev, en describe it, cause... it was like... it was like his dick just... talked to me.
What did it say?
Just...
''Nina.''
Damn.
Damn.
Girl, l'm telling you.
But, look, don't even get all geeked up...
'cause this is nothing serious.
This is no love thing.
Me and Darius, we are just kicking it.
Troy.
Savon, l am so tired of your bullshit.
Would you just wait a minute?
Stop.
You always said you never wanted to be labeled... as trifling or tired.
Trifling?
Guess what? You fit the bill.
Oh, Darius.
Go get your tired-ass friend.
You keep Darius out of it.
How you doing, Troy?
Don't wait by the phone, Negro. lf you'd stop being selfish and save some damn money... we wouldn't be going through this shit.
Savon, get it together.
What?
We were supposed to go play some pool. l know that.
Let me ask you something, Von.
Think you're with the woman you're supposed to be with?
The question implies a belief in destiny... like some cosmic
Iove connection. l'm not convinced anymore.
Just answer the question.
So, you asking me if l married my soul mate?
Depends on which day you ask. l can dig that. lt doesn't really matter anymore, man.
You're with who you're with.
You just gotta ty to make it work.
Real deep, Von.
People with profound insights on life... know not to get married.
And those who do ought to know... that marriage is what you make it.
Right, right.
Wait a minute. This is about that girl, Nina, isn't it?
What you doing, man?
Can l get my shot?
No. This is about Nina, right?
She jacked you up, didn't she?
She jacked me up.
Ooh, man!
Dude, l mean... it defies description.
She put the Vodum, the Santeria... the Yoruba, all of it.
She put it on me, man.
The next morning, l got up and made breakfast.
You made breakfast? l was in there cooking.
Wait a minute. You cooked what?
A cheese omelet.
A cheese omelet?
D, you better put your name on that.
That's better than a Michael Jordan comeback.
Best thing since
Michael Jordan's comeback. l'm serious, man.
You think she's your soul mate?
No. Hardly. l just said the sex was good, that's all.
This ain't no love thing.
We're just kicking it.
One truism in life, my friend--
When that jones come down... it be a mothe_ucker. l hope you cleaned up.
Why?
'Cause l'm not tying to find any bobby pins... and stockings and some old makeup.
Please. Rarely do l divulge the location... to the secret Batcave.
You're lucky l didn't knock your ass out... with some spray. Come on. lt definitely looks like a bachelor's pad.
So, what... you just don't believe in CDs? lt's from my D.J.ing days.
Yeah, l still like that vinyl sound.
Oh, wait.
What, this is my fashion spread?
Let me get my pose.
Just be natural, silly.
One more.
That's enough with the camera, all right?
Take off your clothes.
Excuse me?
Take off your clothes.
Take off my clothes?
Oh, man.
Hold on, hold on. l've already seen what you got.
All right.
You're crazy.
Now, this wouldn't happen... to wind up in somebody's magazine or book or something?
Oh, no, baby.
This is strictly for my private collection.
That's enough with the camera.
Why, you don't trust me? l didn't say that. l think that you're incredibly beautiful.
-Really?
-Really.
Hey, baby.
Marvin. lf this is the part where you ty to get me back... you can forget it.
Come on, now. Hear me out.
Baby, l know l made some mistakes... and l'm sory, all right? l just...
Shit. l'm no good with this shit. l'm bad with words.
You know that.
Bang.
What is that? lt's a train ticket to New York.
Come stay with me. l want us to be together.
Marvin, you had all of that... and didn't know what to do with it.
Well, l want it again.
How are you gonna just do this to me?
How are you gonna just show up, come out of nowhere...
Don't you understand that what you want... doesn't matter anymore?
What's the deal?
Are you working?
Are you seeing somebody?
That's not your business.
Think about it, all right?
You owe me at least that. l don't owe you anything.
Look, l gotta go. l'm meeting my mother for lunch.
You tell her l said hello. l'll do that. l need to know if l still love him or not.
What are you shaking your head for?
Don't shake your head.
This is serious.
You're not gonna tell Darius, are you? l don't want to lie to him.
Tell him.
You think so? lf he snaps, then you got him... and there's no need to go. ls there?
But if he tries to act all cool and shit... well, then, hey... you're just gonna have to teach his ass a lesson.
Hello. Do your thing, girl.
Do it.
Did you want one?
No, thanks.
You know l've had a good time these past few weeks, right?
Well, we aim to please. l'm serious.
Me, too. l'm going... away next week... to New York.
For how long? l don't know.
Just, like, a couple weeks. l don't know.
What's going on? l have a couple contacts... and l'm just gonna poke around and see if l can find a gig.
And l also have some... other unfinished business that l need to take care of.
Some dude.
We used to be in a...
We used to be in a relationship... and l just haven't seen him in a while.
Hey, that's cool.
We were close once, you know?
Darius, the only reason l'm telling you this... is because l really care about you, and... l'm not tying to play you.
Hey. l understand... and l appreciate your honesty.
But we just kicking it, right?
So it's cool. l mean, go to New York... do whatever you have to do. l mean, you ain't got no ring on your finger.
So, you're not mad?
Hell, no, l'm not mad. l mean, it's cool.
We just friends, right? l mean, if old boy was doing his job in the first place... why am l doing it?
-l'm hip.
-Why am l hittin' it?
Let me tell you the real deal.
The real deal is... she can't hang.
Von, l put it on--Boom.
-Put it on her.
-Now she gone. l steal. l don't get stole on. l feel you, D.
These women, man, they're killing me slow.
So, wait a minute. l thought you guys were just... you know... kicking it.
That's not the point, Savon.
So, what's the point, black man? l'll tell you the point.
Have you been listening? l'm gonna tell you. l'm gonna feed you the point.
The point is... l don't know the point. lt wouldn't be so bad, man... if l didn't think she was the one.
What are you talking about, the one? l think she's the one, Savon. l got your ass. l had you going.
-You got me.
-Check you out.
Why'd you give me that look?
Oh, yeah, you got me. l ain't the only one you got.
Yo, you're slipping on your boy.
-l slipped.
-l had you.
Did you really think l was gonna...
-The one?
-The one.
Please, man... l'm a thief in the night.
You know what l mean?
FBl still on my tail, but they can't get me. l slipped. l'm sory.
You done slipped on me,
'cause l--
-l slipped.
-Hit that ass. l'm out. l'm gone. What?
Let me see your wallet, brother...
'cause it gotta be
''Bad Mothe_ucker'' on it.
''Bad Mothe_ucker'' on it.
You slipped on me, but it's cool.
Let me see your wallet.
Hey, John.
Let me get another one.
Coming right up.
Hey, dude, what's up?
It's Eddie.
Dude, you need to call Savon.
That brother's all strung out over Troy.
Look out.
Hey, Darius, it's Nina. l don't know when you'll get this message... but my train leaves tonight at 9:30... and maybe if you're around
Union Station... you'll come down.
Listen, l guess l'll just call you when l get back. ls there any way you could be... a bit slicker in your approach?
-What exactly do you mean?
-Slicker. lt's the comparative of slick.
Less raw.
You'd have a better chance of being published... if your work were just a bit more polished.
You have a nice day.
Where are my Toasted Oats? l finished the box this morning.
You couldn't eat the damn Captain Crunch?
Oh, please.
Look, l'm sory. l had a bad day today. l had a bad day, too.
You want to tell me about it?
Baby... l hate to see you--
Wasting my time?
That's not what l meant. l can take care of us. l just don't want you to wory about--
Getting a job, right?
Rejection. And stop finishing my sentences. l don't even know why l'm here.
What'd you say?
After all these years together, you don't know why you're here?
All we have, Marvin, is all these years... and it's just not enough... anyMOle. l'm going out for some mothe_ucking Toasted Oats.
You're tripping. l already know what l want.
Oh, no. Stop. Right now.
Stop looking at the girl, man.
See, Ed, l have these amazing powers over women. l just can't explain it.
Sort of like a curse or something.
But lucky for you mere mortals... l use my powers for good and not for evil.
Know what l'm saying?
The world is truly a safer place.
Girl, l am tired. l'm so sory. l gotta get out of here. l have this interview tomorrow. lt's kind of dead tonight anyway.
There's no cuties in the house-- not one cutie. ls there a night you don't have penis on the brain?
Don't even ty it.
You came straight from the station...
'cause you wanted what's-his-name to be here.
Excuse me, but l happen to enjoy poety.
Don't look at me like that.
What?
Save your money. Save it. lt's not happening there.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Why y'all leavin'?
Wood, baby, l didn't see you down there.
Where y'all goin'?
We goin' home. We're tired. l'd like to offer you a ride. l mean, my car's right there.
That's your car, right?
No. The hearse--the gray one.
That's my car.
That's not, like, a working hearse?
No. There ain't been no dead mothe_uckers in it... since l bought it.
'Cause, girl, we might-- l just remembered that l parked my car down the street.
So what we're gonna do is--
-Go.
-Mm-hmm. Thank you.
-Girl, he has balls.
-lt's a Cadillac.
He's killing me.
Oh, my God.
He's so cute, though.
He is really cute.
Then you should go out with him.
Please, girl.
You know he is not my type. l think maybe l should ty to hook you two up.
-No.
-Yes. l'm not tying to get hooked up by anybody.
Marvin is officially black histoy.
Wood is vey, vey cool.
Wait a second. Don't even ty it, because l know you.
Do not even ty it.
You ty to hook us up, and l'm gonna knock you out.
Don't let me have to bring out my karate, girl.
The stuff, you know. l'm just saying that...
All right, go on.
Go home and call Darius. lt's what you really wanna do anyway.
Why are you tying to make it seem like l'm desperate? l'll just call him tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
You the shooter, ain't you?
-Yeah, but what--
-Then shoot me, God damn it. lmmortalize my shit.
How's my light? Hold on. ls this good for me right here? ls this all right?
Hold on, babe. l can't have you making me look bad, you know.
You would have to shoot like my moms to make me look bad... and she got cataracts.
Negro, what do you want done today?
Shit. l want eveything. l want postcards, wallet size, $ x 10s. l want the whole nine.
So you just gonna come up here today and spend all your money?
Yep. l will, if you let me buy you dinner.
The Billy Dee thing is a little played out... but l will give you ten cool points for nostalgia's sake.
Nina, l'm serious.
Wood, what do you want from me?
One dinner. lt ain't algebra, girl. Come on.
No way.
Don't tell me that, please.
Why?
Bloomers are for, like, you know, big girls.
What do you mean they're for big girls? l like bloomers.
They're comfortable.
Girls that just have ass eveywhere.
You got a cute little shape.
And l think you should...
You'd look great in, like, a thong.
Not that l was thinking about that. l'll have to keep that in mind.
Yeah, l'm serious.
That lady over there, she wearing bloomers.
Look how big her ass is.
Leave that woman alone.
Seriously. She just knocked my man the shrimp on the ground. l'm serious. Look.
What kind of unde_ear do you have on? l don't wear drawers.
You don't have any on?
No, l just let it hang.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, what's up, cat daddy?
How's the book coming?
Masterpiece of minimalism.
What's going on?
There ain't nothing.
You know your girl's back in town?
Yeah, l heard.
For the last time, man, she's not my girl, OK?
All right.
Well, that's good, brother... because there's something l bet you didn't know.
You coming through to my party?
No. l can't mess with y'all parties.
Y'all don't serve no food.
-Ain't you something?
-Carrots. l need some food that had parents, man.
You know what l mean?
Some cow up in there.
Some ribs. Something.
-Fried chicken?
-Fried chicken. l'll come, Sheila.
You know l heard about
Wood and Nina.
Figured you had.
Just be cool, OK?
Always, girl. l ain't trippin' now.
What's up, D?
What's up, Wood?
So what you been up to, man?
You know, just puttin' in work, man.
-Really?
-Really.
See, l got this new gig.
Keeps me up, working all through the night.
The late shift? l know all about that kind of job.
Used to work the hell out of it.
Sure you can hang with it? l hate when this happens, you know? l think so.
Moms keep on paging you, huh?
Not this time, D.
We all know you ain't too good at staying employed, though.
This might be different.
You know, and as l heard it... you ain't too good at stayin' employed either, partner.
Well, you see, the difference is... l usually quit my job.
You?
You usually wind up fired.
But it's OK.
You can't help it.
Yo, Sheila, l'll talk to you later.
-Take it easy, Darius.
-Whatever.
He a trip, ain't he? l can't believe that boy.
Aren't you a little old to be fighting over some babe?
You ain't never too old.
Besides, l can't help it if l'm the chosen one.
Oh, OK, l get it.
So it's your turn to hit the skins?
Damn, Sheila. Why does it have to be about sex all the time?
You know, l really like this girl.
We went out, we kicked it, dinner.
Eveything's smooth. lt's so convenient for women to think... that all we want to do is bone.
But sometimes, a man just wanna be held.
Cuddled a little bit.
Hold my back, l'll rub yours, you know?
A little massage or something.
What's wrong with that?
Ain't you progressive enough to understand?
Oh, nigger, l got your progressive.
You a trip. You need a massage.
Hey, baby. l want you to meet a friend of mine--Tracey Powell.
Tracey, this is a vey, vey good friend of mine--
Sheila Downes.
How you doin'?
Make yourself comfortable.
Food's in the dining room, beer's in the fridge.
Thank you.
A lot of special things go on when you ride around in this.
Like, for instance, you know, on a Sunday... l always go through all the lights.
Don't nobody stop me.
There's some benefits to this car. l'm telling you.
Like, for instance, when l want to go to church... l always get up front-- evey time.
Because they probably think you're going to a damn funeral.
That's what l'm saying.
But l ain't. l'm just rollin'.
Your friend, man.
She teaches the class next to mine. English.
What? l work with her.
''l work with her.'' OK.
She isn't my girlfriend or anything. l work with her.
All right.
What?
Oh, man, you know what. l mean, you're married.
What are you, the fuckin' Moral Majority?
-No, no.
-What's this about?
Troy's a good woman. lf my memoy serves me correctly... you told me not to get married. ln fact, y'all did.
-Who? l said that?
-Quit saying ''Who?'' You.
Damn, l did say that.
Also said the Commodores would get back together.
Who knew, man?
Let me tell you something.
People grow apart, right?
People change.
But you wouldn't know anything about that.
What you talking about?
No, you wouldn't, Darius... because the last relationship you been in... that lasted longer than six months, my brother...
WaS...neVel.
Are you kidding? Felicia.
All right, Felicia.
So l maintain... when you get a wife, you advise me on mine.
Y'all run around here jumpin' and hoppin'... fallin' in love and shit.
Fallin' in love ain't shit.
Somebody talk to me, please, about how to stay there.
Do l love my wife? Hell, yes. ls she here? Hell, no.
All right, man.
All right?
As far as l'm concerned... all of y'all can step.
Hey, man... l think you need a hug, Savon.
So, where are you taking me?
A little set, you know.
Whose set?
Some friends. lt'll be cool. Trust me.
Yo! Wait!
Y'all know how to do the slop?
What's this, a choir?
Yes, the slop.
Come on, do it.
-l don't know how to do it.
-'Cause you made that shit up. l'm gonna find somebody who can do the slop.
Yeah, on TV, right? l'll tell you how to get on this horse.
What's up, black people?
Where's your bathroom?
Up the stairs and to the left.
Thanks.
So, what's up, Ed?
You are so foul.
You know it's fucked up what you're doin', right?
-Whatever, man.
-Whatever?
Don't. l told you l know... how to do the slop.
What's up, D?
Hey, what's up, man?
You should see how the slop was done.
Mama showed you?
Yeah. A true professional.
Go ahead, break it down, then.
No. l don't want to put too much hip into it. l need to talk to you outside.
-Right now?
-Right now. l'll be right back.
Take me home now.
Nina, what's wrong?
You embarrassed the shit out of me... and l don't appreciate it. lf you two wanna see whose dick is bigger, do it without me.
-Look, l'm sory--
-Don't say shit to me.
Just take me home.
Like you didn't think he was gonna be at this party?
You gonna take me home or not?
Hell, no.
Unbelievable.
Walk!
Nah, nah, l--
Hey, yo. Where Nina at? l don't know, man.
You just left the woman outside, Wood?
What? You got somethin' to say?
Why don't you say it? l ain't got nothing to say to you.
Nina, slow up. l don't wanna talk right now. lf you slow up, l'll call you a cab.
-Just leave me alone.
-Slow up.
-What?
-First of all, calm down.
You and l both know... you don't wanna be out here this late by yourself... stompin' up and down the street like somebody stole your bike. l just wanna make sure you get home safely.
That's it. Trust me.
We'll walk to this pay phone up here... l'll call you a cab... l'll wait, you get in--Boom.
You can be on your mery way.
Look... what the hell you doing running around with my boy?
First, you tear off to New York... then you come back, don't even call?
You only had to tell me that you were seeing somebody.
What are you talking about? l ain't seeing nobody. l saw you at the bookstore with a girl. l'm always there.
What are you talking about?
You know what l'm talking about.
Oh, shit. Lisa. Damn.
Damn.
Damn. Hey. l just want to call and apologize for the other night. l honestly didn't know you were gonna be there.
Look, no apologies necessay, OK? l have two tickets... to the V.O.N. Steppers set tomorrow night, and... l was just wondering if you could step. l didn't know you were that good.
Yeah, l'm a groove man. l do my little thing.
Didn't know l had it, did ya?
That's what l call a real date.
A real date? What are you talking about, a real date?
You saying we never been on a real date before?
Baby, bumpin' and grindin'... at the Wild Hare hardly qualifies.
Oh, well, you seemed to like all that bumpin' and grinding. l wanted to call you when l got back from New York... but when l saw you with that woman...
-l didn't know what to think.
-l know.
Look, that was absolutely nothing.
Trust me. It was nothing.
Sometimes l just wonder if l'm going too far with you.
Well, there's no such place.
This is a destiny type thing, babe.
What am l gonna do with you? l got a few ideas, but... tell me what you got in mind, huh?
Fountain.
What's up? What you got?
What you want to do?
-This is a joke, right?
-No, it's not a joke.
What's with the pillow and the blanket? What's all that? l know it's a little bit awkward... but l was thinking that... l don't know, we had such--
We had a pe_ect date, and l just-- l just wanted to feel... like l was saving something for later.
Saving something for later?
Ain't gotta save mine for later. l'd rather have it right now.
Nina, we've already done it before.
We done already, you know, repeatedly... so what's with the couch?
Don't be like that.
Come on, don't do this to me. l mean, it's gonna be cold out here.
You'll be fine.
All right, cool.
You're right, l'll be fine.
Good night.
Do you think you could just help me with this zipper?
'Cause sometimes it gets stuck.
Yeah. See, now you're playin'.
All we gotta do is just go upstairs... and l could take off all your clothes.
Thank you.
You ain't gotta do this. l don't know why you playin' like that.
Good night. lt's gonna be mighty cold down here.
You mind turning up the heat?
She's wrong, man.
Shit.
Shit.
Can you feel the heat?
No, not yet.
Ooh, shit! l can.
Mind if l play something for you?
No, not at all. l know this is a black neighborhood.
Send somebody down who can handle themselves.
You guys are terrible.
All l want is my mail.
Don't put me on hold. Don't--
What's wrong with you?
They had me on hold.
What's wrong?
Hello. How you doing?
Fine.
You know what time it is?
Want a beer?
Do you think l slept with Wood? l learned a long time ago... not to ask a question l didn't want to know the answer to.
Why don't you wanna know?
-'Cause l don't.
-Why?
You're wrecking my flow, OK?
Excuse the fuck out of me.
And l didn't wreck your fuckin' flow.
Take off your clothes.
Quit playin'.
Who's playin'?
What's the matter? l've already seen what you got.
Will you stop?
What are you doing?
You don't trust me?
No, l don't.
You don't?
This is about Lisa, isn't it? l can't believe you, Nina.
You still on that Lisa shit?
That amazes me.
Look... we've talked about this a thousand times... and l explained to you-- she and l are over.
That is histoy--the past, OK?
We're together.
So tell me, what is your fucking problem?
-How am l supposed to know that?
-Know what?
That you're not seeing her.
'Cause l just told you, for the last time.
Well, that's not enough,
Darius... because you have not given me any reason... to trust anything that you say.
What are you talking about? l'm talking about the blackboard with her number on it... the phone calls at 5 a.m... tying to read your mind evey fucking day.
You don't know shit about trust, OK? You don't.
You the one who went to New York and fucked old boy... came back here and hung out with my boys... partying and shit.
What is that?
You wanna talk about trust?
You acted like you didn't care that l went to New York.
This shit is for the birds, man.
Really. It is. l don't even know what the fuck you talking--You know what?
You can do us both a real big favor.
Just come over to my crib and get your shit.
Why would you want to be with somebody you don't trust?
Ain't gotta deal with this shit. l guess that's eveything.
Shut my door when you leave.
You getting the work done on that novel, man? l'm not in the mood to write anything right now.
Let me ask you something. lf you were stranded on a deserted island... and could only take one of your ex-girls... who would it be?
Shit, l don't know.
That's the thing, man.
With the exception of Felicia, man... l can't stand to be around them more than a few hours each time.
Now that's a name l ain't heard in a while.
Yep. l messed that up, man... tyin' to be a mothe_ucking player. l used to love that girl, man.
You only get one, two, tops.
One what?
True love.
True love, my ass, man.
Love is what you make and with whom you make it.
That's it.
Think l messed up twice.
You'd think by now l'd have a little more insight, but... l don't know what to think.
That, my friend, is your problem right there.
Physics, this shit ain't. lt ain't supposed to make sense.
Love, passion-- it is what it is.
Fuck!
Savon, you and your wife both bluffing. That's my joker.
Can l get my book? Can l?
Y'all are both cheaters, man.
Speak to me.
Darius, it's Josie.
Oh, hey, what's happening?
Look, Nina told me not to tell anyone this, but...
-Fuck it.
-What is it? l thought you should know.
She did a shoot for Vibe magazine... and it worked out really well.
Good for her.
And since you--
Why you calling me, anyway?
Look, she's on the noon train tomorrow. l thought maybe you should see her off.
Well, maybe not.
You do what you want to do. l just thought l should tell you.
Thanks for your concern.
Jesus.
-Stop.
-You can't play.
Hey, Darius, who was that?
All aboard!
Are you all right?
Vey nice.
Give me that smile.
There it is.
Nina, here's your tickets... and itineray for the Chicago shoot.
Great. Thank you.
Don't wory about it.
There you go.
Cool.
Thanks.
You're vey welcome, sir.
So, let's see this masterpiece.
Stand back.
You might hurt yourself, bro.
That's it right there.
The book signing party is gonna be real nice.
Whoa, sucky, sucky, sucky now.
Man, this is--
That's a jacked-up picture, though.
Why you gotta talk about the picture?
That's a jacked-up picture.
Say something about my picture.
Congratulations.
Thanks. lt's a dream come true.
An old one, man, an old one.
That's a nice dedication.
So how come you never called her? l wrote her a bunch of letters, but... l thought it made me
Iook like a fool. l never mailed any of them. l would've paid some mad money... to see your ass running through Union Station. l hear you, man.
Had you not been sucking on them cancer sticks... you'd have caught her. l'm cool, man.
Excuse me, can l see that?
Sure.
Thanks.
Next up, our next poet is--
Our next poet is a virgin to the mike... but... l'm sure you'll feel her just the same.
Sanctuay, welcome...
Miss Nina Mosley.
This is... something that l've been working on for a while... and l was hoping that a certain someone would be here tonight... but l don't... see him, so... l guess l'm gonna get it out anyway. lt's funny what you can do in front of people... you can't seem to do in front of one person. lt is the color of light... the shape of sound high in the evergreens. lt lies suspended in hills... a blue line in a red sky. l am looking at sound. l'm hearing the brightness... of high bluffs and almond trees. l am tasting the wilderness of lakes... rivers, and streams... caught in an angle of song. l am remembering the water... that glows in the dawn... the motion tumbled in earth... life hidden in mounds. l am dancing... a bright beam of light. l am... remembering... love.
Look, Reg, l'm gonna talk to you.
All right, cool.
Thanks.
Nina Mosley.
Long time no see. l enjoyed your poem up there. l know there have... been a lot of mistakes... and we both made them. l apologize for my part in that.
And all that nonsense in the past... l don't give a shit about that anymore. l never stopped thinking about you. l want us to be together again... for as long as we can be.
As usual, your timing couldn't be worse.
You always want what you want when you want it.
Why is eveything so urgent with you?
Let me tell you something.
This here, right now... at this vey moment, is all that matters to me. l love you.
That's urgent like a mothe_ucker.
-How do we do this?
-l don't know.
-l live in New York.
-l don't care.
All right, so... what's the first step?
We can start by getting out of this rain.
Derek.
Derek.
Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.
How long's he been there?
- I don't know.
What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.
Is he strapped?
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.
- Stay right here.
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.
Derek.
Shh, shh, shh.
They're right here.
I don't have a personal problem with him, okay?
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.
You hate this child and I think I know why.
I went out with his mother a few times.
That was three years ago. It was nothing.
Nothing. Really? Hmm.
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?
You've gotta draw the line.
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.
You told them they could do a report on any book...
...that related to the struggle for civil rights. In plain English.
I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused and harbors some sick ideas...
...but I am not ready to give up on him yet.
His brother probably put him up to it.
I can guarantee you 100 percent his brother did not put him up to this.
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.
I know he was a good kid and it's a shame what he's been through...
...but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?
Bob, that goes too far.
This racist propaganda, this Mein Kampf psychobabble?
He learned this nonsense, Murray, and he can unlearn it too.
I will not give up on this child yet.
- I knew it was you.
Danny, get in here.
I said, get in here. Get in here!
Five, four, three...
...two... Shut the door.
What's it gonna be, Danny?
What's what gonna be?
This petty crap you're pulling.
I don't know.
Have a seat.
How you doing?
Fine.
Things at home okay?
Yeah.
Derek got out this morning, did he not?
Yeah, he did.
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.
Like you. But he hung out with simple-minded fools.
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.
Look, did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?
Because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.
Look, I followed directions and I wrote an A paper.
"Mein Kampf"?
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.
Your rhetoric and your propaganda aren't gonna save you out there.
So here's the drill.
I'm your history teacher from now on.
We will discuss current events.
We will call this class...
...American History X.
We meet once a day.
All right, your first assignment is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
Oh, come on. It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.
I want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding Derek's incarceration.
How these events helped shape your present perspective...
...concerning life in contemporary America.
The impact on your life.
Your family's.
Whatever you wanna say, Danny...
...I'll be the only one reading it.
But if it's not on my desk...
...tomorrow morning...
...you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.
Are you clear?
Yeah, I'm clear.
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?
Is that what's happening?
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?
Why you all kicking him like that?
What's up, man?
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.
What's up?
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?
You wanna die?
Punk-ass white boy.
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.
He don't wanna see me and the heater.
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.
Punk-ass motherfucker.
We'd smoke that fool.
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.
We got a whole file on skinheads.
These all part of the same gang?
Venice Beach Gang.
Where's my buddy?
He's doing a stretch at YA.
This guy C.C.?
Mm-hm.
That him?
Yeah, that's him right there.
This morning we have a guest coming in, and there he is.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.
He's been doing outreach work with gangs, both in and out of the can.
Three years ago, a local kid named Derek Vinyard...
...was sent up for murdering two Crips who were trying to jack his car.
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and he's followed the case closely.
He was a skinhead, right?
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.
Here you go. Have a look-see.
Cameron Alexander, well...
...he's a Venice Beach landmark.
He's probably the biggest distributor of white-power literature and videos...
...in L.A. County.
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.
And, uh, in his spare time this guy even writes hate columns.
Does he have a record?
He's pretty clean.
Been trying to pin something to him, but it doesn't work.
Trust me. He's behind all of it.
He runs everything out of his house down by the beach.
No white gangs in Venice Beach...
...before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.
Alexander found in Derek his shining prince.
Essentially, he used Derek to recruit a slew of insecure...
...frustrated and impressionable kids.
This kid Vinyard, well, he's got a lot of baggage...
...as you'll see in this tape that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...
...was shot and killed battling a blaze at a suspected Compton drug den.
We're at the Vinyard home right now...
...and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.
Derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second.
Look, I know this is tough, but, um, how do you feel right now?
How do you think I feel?
- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?
This country's becoming a haven for criminals, so, what do you expect?
Decent, hardworking Americans like my dad...
...are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
Parasites?
Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.
I don't understand.
You're saying your father's murder was race-related?
Yeah, it's race-related.
Every problem in this country is race-related, not just crime.
Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are problems of the black community...
...the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.
Aren't those issues that deal more with poverty?
No. They're not products of their environments, either. That's crap.
Minorities don't give two shits about this country.
They come here to exploit it, not to embrace it.
Millions of white European-Americans came here and flourished.
Within a generation. What the fuck is the matter with these people?
They have to go around shooting at firemen.
- What does this have to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.
Putting out a fire in a nigger neighborhood...
...he shouldn't have given a shit about.
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer who probably collects a welfare check.
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
Derek Vinyard was released from Chino earlier this morning...
...after serving three and some-odd years.
I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
If something happens to him...
...things could get very ugly down by the beach.
Just keep it low.
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.
It used to be a great neighborhood.
The boardwalk's always been a dump...
...but when my dad moved us out here...
...Venice was a nice, quiet place to grow up.
Over the years, though, it's just gone to hell.
The gangs are like a plague.
They moved west from Inglewood and South Central...
...and basically took over.
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?
Fuck all y'all.
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.
Fuck y'all.
You all right?
I'm all right.
Yo, is that that fool you was telling me about?
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.
Yeah, man, that's him.
Bitch-ass motherfucker.
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.
He said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared in their own neighborhood.
For a while there, he really made it like it was ours again.
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.
- Pass that thing.
- D up.
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Come on.
Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
He does a spin move every time. Every time.
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.
This one's for you, boy!
- Fuck you...?
- Stop that.
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through monkeying around with your ass!
You pale, pastrami-eating, cracker motherfucker...
...a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!
I'll take care of this.
Hey.
I got a bet.
I come in this game right now. Same score, but we play black guys against white guys.
Motherfucker.
Oh, shit.
Name your price, cracker.
No money. No money. For these courts.
And not just today. For good.
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win...
...no bitching, no fighting...
...here in front of everybody, pack your shit and get your black asses out of here.
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.
Eight to six, our ball.
Let's go.
Pick him up. Pick him up.
Seth, get back and play some D!
Come on, Seth.
Come on, let's go.
All right. Defense!
All right.
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.
Damn!
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.
Pick, pick, Derek!
Bullshit! That's offense.
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!
Chill out, bro. Chill out.
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.
You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.
You can't let niggers get away with that shit.
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.
Watch this.
Get that ball.
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.
Yeah!
Bye-bye.
Get the fuck off my court.
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!
Yeah!
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!
Yeah.
Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.
He said it would make it too hard for him...
...and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow.
Three years without him, just wondering...
...and then at 7:00 this morning...
...we picked him up outside the gate.
Come on, Danny.
Der.
The whole ride back, he didn't say anything.
I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later. "
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?
No, man.
I just know you'll need someone to look after you while you adjust to all this space.
Yeah, right.
This place is smaller than the old living room.
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.
- I don't know. The girls like it, so...
- Well, I don't.
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?
Yeah.
Shit, look, I forgot, man.
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?
I got it about a month ago.
Cameron made it official.
- Cameron?
- Yeah.
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
Hello?
- What?
Hi. Just hang on a second.
Derek, it's for you.
Nothing. Nothing.
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.
I'll get it in the back.
I got it.
Yeah? Oh, hey.
What?
My eyes have seen the glory
Of the trampling at the zoo
We washed ourselves in niggers' blood
And all the mongrels' too
We're taking down the ZOG machine
Jew by Jew, by Jew
The white man marches on
You think our friend was behind that?
You know what? I don't even care.
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.
Mwah.
My sweet kid. My baby boy.
God, what's with the love fest, you guys?
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.
I'll get it.
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?
Fuck you!
- Seth.
What's up, Dan?
How you doing? Where's Derek?
He's on the phone.
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.
- Give me a minute.
Vinyard!
No, I'll be out in a minute.
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do?
I won't stay in my room the rest of my life.
Hold on.
Hey. Hey. What the fuck is Seth doing here?
Did you invite him over?
No, he always comes over here.
All right. Danny, give me a minute.
Just give me one minute.
Yeah.
God, are you still here, Goodyear?
You calling me a blimp, you fucking Democrat?
When was the last time you were able to see your feet?
Come in here, Danny.
Seth.
Hey, man, you going to Cam's party tonight?
Is Davina's ass watertight?
You're fucking sick, man.
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.
Tell me some of the shit you've learned, fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.
Okay. I believe in death, destruction, chaos, filth and greed.
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?
Look, you got to let me do this my own way, all right?
I'll take care of it.
Who do you hate, Danny?
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.
Why?
They're a burden to the advancement of the white race.
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?
"We don't know them. We don't wanna know them. They're the fucking enemy. "
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.
I hate the fact that it's cool to be black these days.
Good.
I hate this hip-hop...
...fucking influence on white fucking suburbia.
- Good.
And I hate Tabitha Soren...
...and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...
...telling us we should get along.
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...
...because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
That's the best shit I've heard come out of your mouth.
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.
I know you don't believe that.
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.
Is that any way to talk to a guest?
A friend of the family?
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?
Fucking A. Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ, man.
I think you lost weight, man. I can get my arms almost all the way around you.
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
It's good to have you back.
Grab your jacket, let's get the fuck out of here.
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.
Look...
Hey, uh, listen...
...did you pull some shit in school today?
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.
- Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
- You should've...
Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.
This kid is smart as hell.
Was that Sweeney on the phone?
Yeah, Sweeney called.
What are you talking to Sweeney for?
Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.
That's what he was like when we were there.
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.
Come here. Seriously, look...
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a living.
You don't wanna be like that.
I'm serious. It's not funny.
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.
So don't fuck it up with small-fry shit like that.
You got to be smarter than that.
You gotta see the bullshit paper he's making me write.
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.
Do it. You do anything he tells you to do. I mean it.
I don't want you in trouble in school, trying to impress me...
...taking this shit in there, all right?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I guess, but I was doing it because I thought you'd be happy.
Well, I'm not.
Shit. Listen to that.
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.
Okay.
Later.
She's coughing her lungs out and you're blowing this shit in her face all day.
- Put it out.
I'm putting it out.
All right. Come on.
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.
Mommy, are you okay?
What are you doing? Put that out.
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke and you're here sucking on it.
Nice thing to come home to, huh?
Yeah.
You all right?
Look...
...you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.
I want you to take Danny's and my room and we'll hit the couch.
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.
Can I go with you?
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.
I could drop out of school.
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!
- God.
- I want him out of my house.
I know, I know. Look.
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you later tonight.
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.
I need you to stay away from the party, all right?
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.
Promise me you'll stay away from that party.
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?
Whatever.
God!
Come on, let's go.
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.
It didn't take long for Derek to make a name for himself.
And Cameron knew just how to use it.
You sure you don't wanna stick around?
You know I'd love to...
...but I gotta be careful.
Yeah, I know.
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.
- All right.
- Good luck.
He sent Derek to the kids...
...to the frustrated ones.
The ones who were sick of getting their asses kicked by black and Mexican gangs.
Don't just be some punk...
...be part of something.
All right, let's go. Pull it together.
And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.
Let's go. Come on, we're not here to fucking socialize.
Shut the fuck up.
Check this shit out, man.
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants bedding down in this state tonight.
This state spent $3 billion last year...
...on services for people who had no right to be here in the first place.
Three billion dollars.
Four hundred million dollars just to lock up a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals...
...who only got into this country because the INS decided...
...it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons.
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.
Our border policy is a joke.
So is anybody surprised that south of the border they're laughing at us?
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.
Every night these parasites stream across the border...
...like some fucking pinata exploded.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.
It's about decent, hardworking Americans falling through the cracks...
...and getting the shaft.
The government cares about...
...the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor. "
Well, it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor.
And I say until you take care of that, close the fucking book!
Because we're losing.
We're losing our right to pursue our destiny.
We're losing our freedom...
...so that a bunch of fucking foreigners can come in and exploit our country.
And this isn't something that's going on far away.
This isn't happening in places we can't do anything about it.
It's happening right here! Right in our neighborhood. Right in that building.
Archie Miller ran that grocery store since we were kids here.
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys...
...and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
I see this shit going on and I don't see anybody doing anything about it.
And it fucking pisses me off!
So look around you.
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...
...quietly standing there while our country gets raped?
Fuck that.
Are we gonna ante up and do something?
Fuck, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
You're goddamn right we are.
Come here!
Don't you know it's against the law to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?
Fuck that! Fuck that!
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Please! Please, no!
You fucking spic!
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.
Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.
Here we go.
Yeah, that's it.
Get the fuck up!
Get down!
Have some fucking beans, you goddamn beaner.
Yeah!
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!
Get some of that in there.
- Throw it on, throw it on.
Hey, that's a great color on you.
You can get a white woman's job, bitch.
A little better than this one, huh?
Yeah.
- White.
You can move up in the world, huh?
Asshole!
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!
All right, let's go! Let's go!
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go.
No green card, no fucking work, comprendes?
- Come on. Come on!
Go, go, go.
We're fucking done! Come on!
Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.
Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.
Everyone was feeling so good that we just didn't see it coming.
Maybe we should have.
The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots...
...were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.
Why trash your own neighborhood?
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.
It's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected...
...and turned away by the system.
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts...
...or the riots in Chicago in '68...
I don't buy that for a minute.
Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a cop-out.
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...
...grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store.
The fact these people ripped off stores...
...in their own communities reflects that these people...
...have no respect for the law.
And certainly no concept of community or civic responsibility.
Wait a minute. White people commit crimes against white people too.
But they're not offing each other in record numbers all over America.
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.
One in every three black males is in some phase of the correctional system.
Is that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
Not only that. They're proud of it.
Maybe it says something about prejudice in the judicial system.
If you wanna talk about criminal statistics...
...you might wanna take a look at the social inequalities that produce them.
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.
You're taking one thing and calling it something else...
...and alleviating the responsibility that these people have for their own actions.
It's like saying:
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty. "
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.
Because the media twisted things around so people focused on these cops...
...whether they'd get convicted...
...and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.
Everybody lost sight of Rodney King himself.
The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops, and he attacks them.
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.
And there's some yahoo with a video camera who turned it on halfway through...
...so all we see is them hitting him.
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up and cracking him with billy clubs...
...and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull.
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy. "
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.
And those cops end up on the stand defending themselves...
...for using absolutely standard, textbook self-defense procedures.
I don't think the tape showed that at all.
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?
Murray, what do you think?
I did think that the police used their clubs rather excessively.
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.
They're in a better position to make that call than you are.
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority to make those calls...
...because we acknowledge that their job is difficult and dangerous.
You know? Unfortunately, very few people, like, respect that authority.
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.
- What?
- Davina.
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.
I don't respect laws that let monkeys like Rodney King on the street.
Second, I am not, as you well know...
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.
Please. So take your head out of your ass.
You've gotten off the point.
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?
All right, think about this.
If Danny had been walking across the street...
...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?
Mm-hm.
Who would like some dessert?
We're having a discussion.
We're having a nice discussion, right?
If Rodney King had been hopped up on Chivas Regal and PCP...
...and killed Danny, you'd sing a different tune.
I didn't see him hit anybody and neither did you.
He didn't happen to kill anybody.
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...
...everybody would have a different opinion of this matter.
They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.
I mean, it blows my mind.
We're hung up on this notion we have some...
...obligation to help the struggling black man.
Cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.
It's crap. This stuff you guys are saying perpetuates it.
All this liberal nonsense.
Everyone's looking the other way while our country rots from inside out.
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves, what, like, 130 years ago?
How long does it take to get your act together?
Well, Jews have been persecuted for over 5000 years.
Are you saying that it's wrong to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.
Well, look at the way that they scapegoated Chief Gates.
They'd come down that hard on black Willie Williams?
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.
The hell do you think you are?
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!
Sit down! Shut up!
Derek, calm down.
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!
Goddamn it, Derek, move!
Shut your mouth and give my girlfriend respect.
Derek, what are you trying to prove?
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
Come here!
You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina.
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!
Stop!
She can't breathe!
Let her go!
Are you gonna apologize?
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?
You're a fucking asshole.
I hate you!
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.
- That has nothing to do with it!
It doesn't?
You don't think I see what you're doing?
You think I'll sit here and smile while some kike tries to fuck my mother?
It's never gonna happen!
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off and stick it up your ass...
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...
...and poisoning my family's dinner with your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!
Fuck you!
Yeah, walk out.
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading motherfucker!
Get the fuck out of my house!
You see this?
That means "not welcome. "
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!
Primping your hair and your dress!
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?
Aren't you ashamed?
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.
I'm so sorry, Doris.
I really am.
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...
...without a father.
Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in.
Goodbye.
Hey. You all right?
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!
Let me go, goddamn it!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!
I would never hurt you. You know that.
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.
You know that. I'd do anything for you.
I don't believe you.
I trust you, Derek.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.
Going for takeoff.
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.
Oh, no.
No, no! Don't crash!
Gotta go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.
Okay.
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.
A lot of that going around.
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.
Mom, it's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.
Don't get sick from cold, you get sick from germs.
No, you get sick from smoking.
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.
What are you looking at me like that for?
When are you gonna let that beautiful hair grow back?
The day you quit smoking.
Deal.
I better get Ally to bed.
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.
Good night, Mom.
I go back to that night again and again in my mind.
I try to stop it from happening.
I want you out of this house.
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.
He can move in with me.
In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened...
...if I hadn't gone into that room and told him.
Danny, get down!
No, Danny!
Mommy!
Nigger, you just fucked with the wrong bull.
- Come here!
- Get off!
You should've learned your place on the fucking basketball court!
But you fucking monkeys never get the message!
My father gave me that truck, you motherfucker!
You ever shoot at firemen?
You come here, you shoot at my family?
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson, motherfucker.
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.
Come on, man!
Put it on the curb! Right now!
- That's it.
- Derek, no!
No!
Now say good night.
Fucker.
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!
Put your hands up!
I said, get your hands up!
Now turn around!
Put your hands behind your head!
Get down on your knees right now!
It's all right.
It's all right.
Let's go.
Come on.
She ain't gonna open the door?
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?
Danny, it's for you.
I'll be right there.
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!
Come on, Danny!
I'm gonna go get some beers.
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.
What the fuck's up, Seth?
Drink up, Danny, before your brother sees you.
Holy fuck. He's here?
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!
- Oh, shit, yeah.
Derek!
Hey.
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...
...and now fucking Murray turned me in...
...and so Sweeney's making me write another one.
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger people. I hate those guys.
Now, wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.
He's a manipulative, self-righteous Uncle Tom.
He's trying to make you feel guilty about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...
...or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez...
- Heh-heh-heh.
... gets a pat on the head.
Yeah.
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy in that, can't you?
Definitely.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
No, listen to me.
I wanna see you, okay? I do.
But I gotta take care of something tonight.
- Okay.
- You understand?
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.
Leave with me.
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.
Why would you wanna leave? They worship you. You're like a god to them.
If you think we had it good before...
...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.
I don't want my family involved.
Everything I've done here has fucked it up.
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.
Those niggers got exactly what they deserved...
...and we all know that.
I understand you just got out...
...but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.
We won't let a bunch of spooks kick us out of here.
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.
I don't want it anymore.
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.
It's...
It's bullshit, Stacey.
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.
If you wanna be with me, just trust me. Come with me.
Come on.
You're nuts.
You are nuts. No way.
I don't think you realize what's been going on here.
We are 10 times what we were, and we are bloody organized.
I mean, it is like nothing you have ever seen!
This is a mistake. Forget it.
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.
This isn't you.
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me, Stacey.
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.
Lizzy. Thank you.
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics grab for their piece of the pie.
Can't blame them.
Of course, they're gonna have to fight to get it.
And if we scare the fuck out of people...
...and a few people get killed in the process, so be it.
You gonna put that in your paper, Danny?
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.
- You knew I was gonna come.
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.
There's a little blond sitting out there.
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.
All right.
Wait for me right outside.
Take it easy.
Chill out.
You're on safe ground.
You don't have to watch your ass around here.
Come on, sit down. Relax.
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.
But we're just so damned glad you're back, Derek.
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.
It did.
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
The white man marches on
Things have changed since you've been gone, Derek.
You talk about organization?
Wait till you see what we've done with the Internet.
We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego working together now.
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.
Only thing we lack is a little overall leadership.
And that's where you come in.
Because people out there got a lot of respect for you, Derek.
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.
I'm done with it, Cam.
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...
...shaved-head bullshit a long time ago, thank God.
I like your hair the way it is now.
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.
- No more of this grocery store...
- You're not listening.
I am done with it. All that bullshit out there and all your bullshit too.
I'm out.
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time...
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.
You did two months, then rolled over on two kids and let them go down for you.
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!
All right, then. This is stupid.
I'm done.
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.
Get your head on straight, then I'll talk to you.
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?
You got the next crop all lined up and ready to go...
...you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?
You prey on people, Cam! You use them!
I lost three years of my life for your fucking phony cause...
...but I am onto you, you fucking snake.
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.
Remember where you are.
This is not a fucking country club where you can waltz in and out of here...
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!
And Danny is out too.
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.
You can't come barking threats at me.
You can do whatever you want, but Danny is a good kid.
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.
If you come near Danny again...
...I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.
I won't have to.
He'll come to me.
I'm more important to him now than you'll ever be.
Shit!
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!
Why don't you share what you just said to me...
...you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!
Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!
Are you a fucking nigger?
Hey, Danny! Come on.
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?
He's got a gun!
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
Seth.
You make me fucking sick!
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!
Go ahead. Shoot.
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
Seth. Holy shit.
Traitor.
- Kick his ass.
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.
- Shoot him.
Do it! Shoot him!
Oh, God.
Back up. Move.
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.
Move. Move.
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.
I fucking hate you, Der!
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?
Take it easy. Take it easy.
What's happened to you, Der?
Come on. Come on.
This is so fucked.
Look. I'm sorry. All right?
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.
Fuck you, man.
That was so fucked up.
I know. I know.
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
That was fucked up.
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.
It just all went to shit.
It went to shit.
Totally out of control.
What's fucking happening to you, man?
Hey. Look at me.
I can't go back to that, Dan.
Can't go back to what?
To any of it. Those guys, the gang, that life. I'm done with it.
What happened to you up there?
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!
Let's go! You wanna eat today?
Get up! Five minutes!
This is my fucking house! Get up!
What the fuck's your problem, you asshole?
Move!
Joe, open the fucking gates.
All right, back up.
Five minutes. Step forward.
Those beds better be made.
After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.
Come on there, motherfuckers.
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.
I'll fucking kill you.
Fucking keep my eye on you, you white piece of shit.
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy, or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!
Step forward.
Turn to the left.
Step forward to chow. Let's go.
Come on.
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.
Let's go.
All the wrong people knew who I was anyway...
...so I figured I'm just gonna put up a flag and hope a friend sees it.
That's the catapult right there.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Have a seat.
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.
You know why?
Because I control the underwear.
All right, we pick them up over here and we sort them over there.
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me...
...didn't wear no drawers, couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...
...and used to sniff the drawers.
We got two sizes: Medium and large.
All right?
All you do is put the mediums with the mediums...
...and the large with the large.
It's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha, scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
That, you don't wanna do. All right?
You should be happy that you landed this job.
Ain't no telling what the hell they'll have you do in the joint.
By the way, uh...
...what are you in for?
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?
Okay, I know your kind, right?
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.
Well, let me tell you something, man.
You better watch your ass.
Because in the joint...
...you the nigger, not me.
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.
Then everything started getting complicated.
I'll take care of that, all right?
What the fuck is that?
What's that all about?
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?
Mitch has got a little something extra on the side with them boys, you know.
You're kidding, right?
No.
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.
What the fuck is he thinking?
Mitch is the only reason why you're not a corpse.
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here...
...and not a lot of follow-through.
I think you'd better chill out...
...on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.
Ease up on it.
What are you doing here, Doris?
I was in the neighborhood.
Well, look, I told you I don't want you all coming here.
I don't care what you told me, okay?
I need to talk to you now.
So how is everyone?
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.
And, uh, Ally's walking...
...and starting to talk a little.
- How's Danny?
- Danny?
Danny.
He holds you up so high.
He thinks you're the greatest.
He's always bragging about you to Cameron...
...and all his new friends.
He's starting to remind me of you.
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.
You think because I watched my first-born fuck up his entire life...
...that I can sit here and see my baby follow him down the same toilet?
You know what?
I can't fix all this shit from up here, okay?
I'm not asking you to.
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get through this, you make it harder.
You think you're the only one doing time, Derek?
You think you're here all alone?
You think I'm not in here with you?
Fuck, man.
Every day you go through these sheets like you gonna get to the end of them.
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?
Goddamn! No matter how fast you get through them, man...
...they'll keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
Throwing them around ain't gonna do a thing but give you a heart attack.
Know what? That's cool with me.
But you're gonna give me a goddamn heart attack too!
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?
What do I know?
I know I ain't the one getting mad at them damn sheets, though.
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.
"Boys, this is what we gonna do.
We gonna hate some niggers.
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers.
That's all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.
I don't know what a nigger is, but we'll hate them.
My cousin Derek is in the pen right now...
...working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy. "
See? That's the ticket.
Nice and easy.
Now we can ignore each other in peace.
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck. "
Never lets me finish.
Why don't you tell a joke?
Did you fuck him too?
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?
What's up?
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.
He was taking it from the Mexicans and dealing it out to his own people.
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.
Took too damn long.
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!
What?
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like, right?
Come on, don't tell me this smell doesn't remind you of a woman.
God, I miss that smell, man.
The job I had on the outside wasn't much better than this one.
But at least I gotta go home at night and lie down next to this sweet smell.
God, I miss that.
You got a woman?
Yeah, you got a woman, man.
Let me give you some advice. All right?
She comes to visit you...
...whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight.
Don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude. If you do...
...you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
She comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.
Send her away floating, all right?
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight...
...but it's cool to fight because you can make up and have make-up sex.
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.
Where you lay on your back and let her take out all that aggression on you.
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.
It's that pow, pow, pow.
Let her get on top and she's gonna punish you first, right?
"You been a bad boy, huh?
You been a bad boy and I'm gonna punish you.
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you...
...looking at another woman.
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.
I think I can. I forgive.
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.
I forgive you. I for... I for... I forgive you.
I love you!"
Let's keep it moving.
How do you figure the Lakers to ever be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like, the ugliest team in the history of sports.
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.
Look at Kevin McHale.
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.
- How many is that?
- That's enough.
Enough? All right.
I lost count, man.
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.
Who's counting anyway?
All right, so I wanna know something.
What the fuck landed you in here?
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its cover. I can throw these things, all right?
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?
Yo, man, it's none of your business, all right? It's embarrassing, all right?
What? Embar...?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.
You think? Nobody in here got away with anything.
What did you do?
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?
I stole a TV from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
I run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
I run into three cops, all right?
I told you it was embarrassing and you laugh.
Wait a second. Wait a second.
That doesn't make sense.
No, you didn't get six years for stealing a TV.
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out...
...the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.
They said I threw the TV at the officer.
Assault. Six years.
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him. Or something.
Like I said, I came out of the store...
...he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talking about!
Put some D on him, now.
Fuck you.
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!
We're gonna treat you like one.
Come on.
Fuck you.
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!
How is he?
Well, he took six stitches.
Hey, man.
Oh, man, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?
Well, I came to talk about Danny, but we don't have to do that right now.
I brought you some books.
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.
He's headed right where you are.
Oh, man, you know what? My mother already laid this trip on me, man.
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?
What do you expect me to do? It doesn't help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?
I don't want you to do anything. I need to know the truth about how you feel.
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean...
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...
I feel a little inside out.
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things...
...that don't fit.
Well, that happens.
Look, you are too damn smart to be floating around here...
...pretending you don't see the holes in this bullshit.
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.
Right now, your anger is consuming you.
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.
You've been talking about what's going on in me since I was in high school.
How the fuck do you know so much about what's going on inside me?
No, I know about me.
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.
What do you know about the place I'm in?
There was a moment...
...when I used to blame everything and everyone...
...for all the pain and suffering and vile things that happened to me...
...that I saw happen to my people.
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.
Blame society. Blame God.
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?
Has anything you've done made your life better?
No.
You gotta help me now.
Just help me.
Get me out of here, you know?
I'm up in four months for review.
Put in a word for me.
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?
I don't wanna fuck up my family anymore.
I'll go as far away as I can get.
That's not good enough.
You want my help, you gotta do better than that. My help is not unconditional.
But running just ain't good enough.
Fuck him.
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.
Yo, what's up, D?
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled in the mess hall, man?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?
D! Look at me, man!
You can't make it on your own.
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.
Look, I'm not talking about your peckerwood friends!
They were protecting your stupid ass!
You dissed them in public.
Now you're on your fucking own!
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad, then smoke your motherfucking ass!
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?
They're gonna come for me, they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.
What can I do, man?
So I was right back where I started.
Every day, I was sure it was my day.
Every time I stepped out of my cell.
Every time I got in that shower.
I figured it was only a matter of time before they made a move.
I just hoped that it'd be quick.
But it never came.
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.
But after a while
I just put my head down...
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me, and I kept to myself.
The last six months in that place
I was like a ghost.
What's up, man? You getting out?
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
I'm thinking maybe the only reason
I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line for a crazy-ass peckerwood?
Yeah. Right. Stupid.
That's what I thought.
I owe you, man.
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?
Yes, I do.
You'll be out in no time.
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?
You just take it easy on the brothers, all right? The brothers!
God, man.
I'm sorry, Der.
Sorry that happened to you.
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.
I feel lucky because...
...it's wrong, Dan.
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.
And I kept asking myself all the time...
...how did I buy into this shit, you know?
And it's just because I was pissed off.
And nothing I ever did ever took that feeling away.
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.
And that didn't make me feel any different.
It just got me more lost.
And I'm tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.
I'm just tired of it.
And I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm really not.
But I need you to understand.
Because I love you and you're my best friend.
Do you understand?
Yeah, I understand.
All right.
Whoo!
Jesus.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Everything okay?
No, everything's great.
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?
Thank you, though.
All right. Come on, let's go.
Good night.
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?
It's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love.
I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did, and where it all started...
...he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
But the truth is, it started earlier.
All right. Are we all meeting together for the game tonight?
Yes, definitely.
Ben's Burgers, 7:00, then we go watch the big guy play.
Okay. Yeah.
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.
What's the matter, afraid you're gonna get a B?
Might do you good. B minus.
Don't laugh. This guy is different.
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.
He's got two Ph. D.s.
I don't know what he's doing at our school.
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.
- All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.
That's a big surprise.
What? I read.
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.
Well, they don't.
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?
It's this book about this black guy.
We're doing this whole black literature unit.
What is it, Black History Month?
No, it's just like...
This guy Sweeney, you know, it's part of the course now.
Yeah.
What?
Nothing. It's just, you know.
It's everywhere I look now.
What?
This affirmative blaction.
Honey, a few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.
Read the book, ace the guy's test.
Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?
All this stuff about making everything equal.
It's not that simple.
Now you got this book, Native Son.
What happened to the other books in the course?
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph. D. S says they aren't?
Are you gonna trade in great books for black books? Does that make sense?
You gotta question these things, Derek.
You gotta look at the whole picture.
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.
I got two black guys on my squad now who got their job...
...over a couple of white guys who actually scored higher on the test.
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...
...but I got two guys watching my back, responsible for my life...
...who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.
Yeah. Is that what America is about?
No. America's about
"best man for the job. "
You do your best, you get the job.
You know, this affirmative action crap...
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...
...hidden agenda or something going on.
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.
- Well...
- This guy, though...
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney, he comes on, like, so strong...
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...
It's bullshit.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
No, no.
It's nigger bullshit.
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.
Good boy.
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.
It's 5:40 a. M...
...and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.
I don't know if I've ever done that.
Anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.
It won't be easy, but we're all together again.
And I feel good.
I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted.
If I hit the social significance, or whatever you're looking for.
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.
Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.
Is she cute?
She is a fat guy named Hector.
So I'm out of luck.
I just gotta check in, then I'll see about getting my old job back.
Great.
- Good morning.
Yes, my love.
Davina, can you...?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.
You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.
Thanks.
What would you like to wear?
I wanna wear my blue dress today.
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.
- You look good.
Yeah?
You feel good?
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...
...a little...
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.
Listen, I don't know...
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.
I wanna be here.
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.
All right, I got it.
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar and a large milk to go.
Right away.
Hey, Derek.
- Hey.
Derek.
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan are at the ICU at St. John's.
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.
Aw, what?
We were kind of hoping that maybe you'd talk to your old crew.
- Come on. No way.
This is not a good thing.
If there's anybody they'll listen to, it's you.
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.
Those guys are probably gunning for me now.
We're asking for your help here, Derek.
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.
This has got nothing to do with me.
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.
I'm going like this to keep my family in the clear.
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?
You take a break, you'll find no peace.
The way to find peace is to stick.
It's not gonna make a fucking bit of difference.
It might.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?
Yes. I'm asking you to do whatever is in your power to do.
Man.
Fuck.
All right.
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that, let me tell you.
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Come on.
Hey, you. You got something good for me this morning?
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.
What's going on?
Come on.
This is so bad for Seth, man.
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.
I'm glad they're not dead, but other than that, I don't care.
Should we visit them?
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.
Listen, too...
...I saw a car cruising by the house last night when I pulled out of there with Seth.
If you get home before me, look around the street, all right?
Make sure there's nothing going on.
Oh, man. This is bad.
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.
If I made it through Chino...
...this should be a piece of cake, right?
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Go turn that paper in.
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.
I'll see you at home.
All right?
Yeah, I'll see you.
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.
See you later.
- We're gonna be late.
We'd better go.
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?
See you later.
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!
Let him go!
Oh, no. No! No! No!
Oh, Jesus.
No.
Oh, no, no. No.
Oh, Jesus.
God, what did I do?
Oh, God.
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.
My conclusion, right?
Well, my conclusion is...
...hate is baggage.
Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.
It's just not worth it.
Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
He says someone else has already said it best...
...so if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong.
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:
"We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies.
Though passion may have strained...
...it must not break our bonds of affection.
The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched...
...as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. "
Echo Three to Echo Seven.
Han, old buddy, do you read me?
Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?
Well, I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.
Right. I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.
Steady.
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?
Chewie. Chewie?
All right.
Don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you a hand.
Solo.
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna be difficult to spot approaching ships.
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.
Thank you, General.
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
That's right.
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.
Han.
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.
The bounty hunter we ran into in Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you.
- We need?
- Yes.
- What about you need?
- I need?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?
Come on. You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.
No. That's not it.
Come on.
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.
Am I?
Then why are you following me?
Afraid I'd leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.
You could use a good kiss!
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.
I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber.
It's supposed to be freezing.
How we're going to dry her clothes I really don't know.
Oh, switch off!
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?
Princess Leia's been trying to get you on the communicator.
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?
Deck Officer.
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?
I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in the south entrance.
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?
- Why not?
- Impossible man.
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come in the south entrance.
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
Not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold.
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.
That's right, and my friend's out in it.
Your tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker.
Then I'll see you in hell.
You must come along now, R2.
There's really nothing more we can do.
And my joints are freezing up.
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals... although he admits that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight.
The shield doors must be closed.
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.
R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1.
Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.
He's quite clever, you know, for a human being.
Luke.
Luke.
Ben?
You will go to the Dagobah system.
Dagobah system?
There you will learn from Yoda... the Jedi master who instructed me.
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.
- Not much time.
- Ben.
Hang on, kid.
Dagobah system. Dagobah.
This may smell bad, kid...
Yoda.
But it'll keep you warm till I get the shelter up.
Ben. Dagobah.
I thought they smelled bad... on the outside.
Echo Base, I've got something.
Not much, but it could be a life form.
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.
Captain Solo, do you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.
Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.
Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.
You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.
Well, Your Worship...
Iooks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
I had nothing to do with it.
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave... until we've activated the energy field.
That's a good story.
I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.
Laugh it up, fuzzball... but you didn't see us alone in the south passage.
She expressed her true feelings for me.
My...
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted... scruffy-looking nerf herder!
Who's scruffy-lookin'?
I must have hit close to the mark to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?
I guess you don't know everything about women yet.
Headquarters personnel, report to command centre.
Headquarters personnel, report to command centre.
Take it easy.
Excuse us, please.
Princess, we have a visitor.
We picked up something outside Zone 12 moving east.
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.
There's something very weak coming through.
Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.
- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?
Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.
It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
We'd better start the evacuation.
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment... from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.
We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of humans forms.
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.
That's it.
The rebels are there.
My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
Set your course for the Hoth system.
General Veers, prepare your men.
Admiral.
Groups Seven and 10 will stay behind to fly the speeders.
As soon as each transport is loaded... evacuation control will give clearance for launch.
Right, sir.
All right. That's it.
Try it.
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-47 s.
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time to get small modules on the transports.
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
Okay, okay.
Hi, kid.
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
You too.
General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers... coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.
Reroute all power to the energy shield.
We gotta hold them till all transports are away.
Prepare for ground assault.
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.
ComScan has detected an energy field... protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system.
The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
The rebels are alerted to our presence.
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system.
He felt surprise was wiser.
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
Yes, my lord.
Lord Vader.
The fleet has moved out of light speed, and we're preparing to...
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.
- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?
Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field... and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system.
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.
Thank you, Lord Vader.
All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance.
The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.
Only two fighter escorts per ship.
The energy shield can only be opened for a short time... so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
The ion cannon will fire several shots... to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.
When you've gotten past the energy shield... proceed directly to the rendezvous point.
Understood?
Good luck.
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.
Their primary target will be the power generators.
Prepare to open shield.
Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
Good. Our first catch of the day.
Stand by, ion control.
Fire.
The first transport is away.
Feeling all right, sir?
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?
Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
I know what you mean.
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.
Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
Echo Station 57, we're on our way.
All right, boys, keep tight now.
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.
Steady, Dak.
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.
I'm coming in.
Hobbie, you still with me?
That armour's too strong for blasters.
Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.
Stand by, Dak.
Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.
Dak?
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.
Rogue Three.
Copy, Rogue Leader.
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.
I'll cover for you.
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.
Coming around, Rogue Leader.
Steady, Rogue Two.
Activate harpoon.
Good shot, Janson.
One more pass.
Cable out.
Let her go!
Detach cable.
Cable detached.
Come on!
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.
We have no choice.
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
This one goes there, that one goes there. Right?
R2, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?
And do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
All troops will debark for ground assault.
Prepare to target the main generator.
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.
Set for position three.
Steady.
Stay tight and low.
This is it!
Hobbie!
I've been hit!
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.
Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope to protect the fighters.
Imperial troops have entered the base.
Imperial troops have entered...
Come on. That's it.
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports.
Wait for me.
Begin retreat!
Fall back!
- Distance to power generators?
Target. Maximum firepower.
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.
I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.
Where are you going?
Come back!
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!
- How typical.
- Come on.
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.
Wait! Wait!
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.
Sir, might I suggest that you...
It can wait.
This bucket of bolts will never get past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Come on! Come on!
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
See?
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.
Punch it!
R2.
Get her ready for take-off.
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.
Yes, R2.
That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?
Stardestroyers, two of'em coming right at us.
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!
Check the deflector shield.
Great. Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them.
Take evasive action!
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!
They're getting closer.
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
Watch what?
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.
Horizontal boosters!
Alluvial dampers.
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one.
Chewie!
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.
Han, get up here.
Come on, Chewie!
Asteroids.
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?
You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field...
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.
I take it back.
We're gonna get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?
I'm going closer to one of the big ones.
- Closer?
- Closer?
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.
There. That looks pretty good.
What looks pretty good?
Yeah. That'll do nicely.
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah. Me too.
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.
No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
I'm not picking up any cities or technology.
Massive life form readings though.
There's something alive down there.
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
I know! I know!
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.
R2?
Where are you?
R2!
You be more careful.
R2, that way.
R2!
Oh, no.
Are you all right?
Come on.
You were lucky to get out of there.
Anything broken?
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...
I'm beginning to agree with ya.
R2, what are we doing here?
It's like... something out of a dream or...
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.
Yes, Admiral?
Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord... but it has entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk...
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.
I'm gonna shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does that include shutting me down too?
No. I need you to talk to the Falcon... find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Not entirely stable?
I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
Sometimes I just don't understand human behaviour.
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.
Let go.
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.
Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
Sorry, sweetheart.
I haven't got time for anything else.
Ready for some power?
Okay.
Let's see now.
Put that in there.
There you go.
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.
It's really a strange place to find a Jedi master.
This place gives me the creeps.
Still... there's something familiar about this place.
I don't know.
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?
Like we're being watched.
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.
I am wondering, why are you here?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?
Found someone you have,
I would say.
Right.
Help you I can. Yes.
I don't think so.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Great warrior.
Wars not make one great.
Put that down.
Hey! That's my dinner.
How you get so big eating food of this kind?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle.
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.
Aw, cannot get your ship out.
Get out of there.
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.
You're making a mess.
Hey, give me that.
Mine, or I will help you not.
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.
I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mud-hole.
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.
R2, let him have it.
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.
Jedi master. Yoda.
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?
Take you to him I will.
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.
Come.
Good food. Come.
Come, come.
R2... stay and watch after the camp.
Where is R2 when I need him?
Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate... but it has the most peculiar dialect.
I believe it says the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.
Here. And, Chewie...
I think we better replace the negative power coupling.
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure, Leia.
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.
You could be a little nicer though.
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.
Occasionally, maybe... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Scoundrel?
I like the sound of that.
- Stop that.
- Stop what?
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.
I'm not trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
I happen to like nice men.
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.
Sir, sir!
I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.
That, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes.
Considering the damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.
No, Captain, they're alive.
I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?
The emperor commands you to make contact with him.
Move the ship out of the asteroid field... so that we can send a clear transmission.
Yes, my lord.
What is thy bidding, my master?
There is a great disturbance in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy...
the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.
I have no doubt this boy...
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
How is that possible?
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.
You will know it to be true.
He could destroy us.
He's just a boy.
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him.
The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
If he could be turned... he would become a powerful ally.
Yes.
He would be a great asset.
Can it be done?
He will join us or die, master.
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
Patience. For the Jedi, it is time to eat as well.
Eat. Eat.
Hot.
Good food. Good.
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?
Not far. Yoda not far.
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
Root leaf. I cook.
Why wish you become Jedi?
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!
I cannot teach him.
The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him... like his father.
Was I any different when you taught me?
No.
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.
I am ready.
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained.
AJedi must have the deepest commitment... the most serious mind.
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was... what he was doing.
Adventure.
Excitement.
AJedi craves not these things.
You are reckless.
So was I, if you remember.
He is too old.
Yes, too old to begin the training.
But I've learned so much.
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.
I'm not afraid.
You will be.
You will be.
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.
There's something out there.
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.
There it is. Listen!
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.
Then I'm going with you.
I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship.
Oh, no.
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock.
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yeah.
Watch out!
It's all right. It's all right.
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and make sure there are no more attached... chewing on the power cables.
Mynocks?
Go inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!
Wait a minute.
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!
No time to discuss this in committee!
I am not a committee!
You can't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field.
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.
- Look!
- I see it.
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.
- This is no cave.
- What?
Yes, run.
Yes.
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...
The dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down the dark path... forever will it dominate your destiny.
Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
Vader.
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.
Quicker, easier, more seductive.
How am I to know the good side from the bad?
You will know... when you are calm, at peace... passive.
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defence... never for attack.
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.
Nothing more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
There's something not right here.
I feel cold.
- Death.
- That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.
A domain of evil it is.
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.
Sir, we have a priority signal from the Stardestroyer Avenger.
Right.
There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.
You are free to use any methods necessary... but I want them alive.
No disintegrations.
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.
My lord, we have them.
Thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?
One, two... three!
It's not fair.
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.
Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield.
One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Turn her around.
Turn her around! I'm gonna put all power in the front shield.
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving... a direct assault on an imperial Stardestroyer...
Shut up!
They're moving to attack position.
Shields up.
Track them. They may come around for another pass.
Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.
They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.
Get a shuttle ready.
I shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.
Use the Force.
Yes.
Now, the stone.
Feel it.
Concentrate!
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.
So certain are you.
Always with you it cannot be done.
Hear you nothing that I say?
Master, moving stones around is one thing.
This is totally different.
No. No different.
Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.
Do... or do not.
There is no try.
I can't. It's too big.
Size matters not.
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
And well you should not... for my ally is the Force.
And a powerful ally it is.
Life creates it... makes it grow.
Its energy surrounds us... and binds us.
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.
You must feel the Force around you.
Here, between you, me... the tree, the rock... everywhere.
Yes... even between the land and the ship.
You want the impossible.
I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan and found nothing.
If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed... it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now.
Alert all commands.
Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory.
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...
Admiral.
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
The fleet's beginning to break up.
Go stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
I really don't see how that's going to help.
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.
The Empire may be gracious enough...
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?
If they follow standard imperial procedure... they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed.
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?
Then we gotta find a safe port somewhere around here.
Any ideas?
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.
- Lando.
- Lando system?
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
Card player, gambler.
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.
Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
Lando conned somebody out of it.
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.
- Can you trust him?
- No.
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.
You do have your moments.
Not many of them, but you do have them.
Concentrate.
Feel the Force flow.
Yes.
Good.
Calm.
Yes.
Through the Force, things you will see.
Other places.
The future. The past.
Old friends long gone.
Control, control.
You must learn control.
I saw a city in the clouds.
Friends you have there.
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.
Future?
Will they die?
Difficult to see.
Always in motion is the future.
I've gotta go to them.
Decide you must how to serve them best.
If you leave now, help them you could... but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
No, I don't have a landing permit.
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!
You will not deviate from your present course.
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
Permission granted to land on Platform 327.
Thank you.
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.
Who's worried?
No one to meet us.
I don't like this.
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Trust me.
See? My friend.
Keep your eyes open.
Hey.
Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler.
You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.
Yes. Very friendly.
What are you doing here?
Repairs. I thought you could help me out.
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?
Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
How you doin', Chewbacca?
Still hanging around with this loser?
Hello.
What have we here?
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.
- And who might you be?
- Leia.
Welcome, Leia.
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.
That ship saved my life quite a few times.
She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient.
I've had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labour difficulties.
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.
You sound like a businessman, a responsible leader.
Who'd have thought that, huh?
Seeing you sure brings back a few things.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being successful.
Nice to see a familiar face.
How rude!
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.
I wonder if... Hello?
How interesting.
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.
Luke, you must complete the training.
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.
You must not go.
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.
But you cannot control it.
This is a dangerous time for you... when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.
But I've learned so much since then.
Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.
It is you and your abilities the emperor wants.
That is why your friends are made to suffer.
That's why I have to go.
Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader.
You won't.
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.
Only a fully trained Jedi knight, with the Force as his ally... will conquer Vader and his emperor.
If you end your training now... if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did... you will become an agent of evil.
Patience.
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for... yes.
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.
I cannot interfere.
I understand.
R2, fire up the converters.
Don't give in to hate.
That leads to the dark side.
Strong is Vader.
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.
I will.
And I'll return. I promise.
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.
Now... matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
No, there is another.
The ship's almost finished. Two or three more things and we're in great shape.
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
I don't trust Lando.
Well, I don't trust him either, but he is my friend.
Besides, we'll soon be gone.
Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
What happened?
Where?
Found him in a junk pile?
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
Thank you.
Would you join me for a little refreshment?
Everyone's invited, of course.
Having trouble with your droid?
No. No problem. Why?
You see, since we're a small operation... we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the Empire.
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.
Our operation is small enough not to be noticed.
Which is advantageous for everybody... since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
Aren't you afraid the Empire's gonna find out, shut you down?
It's been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built.
But things have developed that'll ensure security.
I've just made a deal that'll keep the Empire out of here forever.
We would be honoured if you would join us.
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
No, 3PO's with them.
Just hang on.
We're almost there.
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.
No, please don't get up.
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!
Lord Vader.
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt... after I have Skywalker.
He's no good to me dead.
He will not be permanently damaged.
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
They must never again leave this city.
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?
No.
Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
This deal is getting worse all the time.
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.
Something's not right because now I can't see.
That's much better.
Wait. Wait.
Oh, my!
What have you done?
I'm backwards!
You flea-bitten furball!
Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
I feel terrible.
Why are they doing this?
They never even asked me any questions.
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.
Vader's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
They'll have to stay here, but they'll be safe.
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.
He's after somebody called Skywalker.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?
My friend.
Stop!
I've done all I can.
Sorry I couldn't do better, but I got my own problems.
Yeah.
You're a real hero.
You certainly have a way with people.
This facility is crude... but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker... for his journey to the emperor.
Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.
Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. It might kill him.
I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.
We will test it on Captain Solo.
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.
Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility for me... so don't do anything foolish.
What's going on, buddy?
You're being put into carbon freeze.
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.
The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in.
Chewbacca, stop!
No, Chewie, stop!
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.
Chewie, this won't help me.
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.
The princess.
You have to take care of her.
Do you hear me?
- I love you.
- I know.
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.
They've encased him in carbonite.
He should be quite well-protected... if he survived the freezing process, that is.
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
Yes, he's alive.
And in perfect hibernation.
He's all yours, bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
Skywalker has just landed, lord.
Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.
Calrissian... take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
You said they'd be left under my supervision.
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don't alter it any further.
Luke, don't! It's a trap!
It's a trap!
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.
But you are not a Jedi yet.
Well done.
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.
Move.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.
Do you think that after what you did to Han...
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.
I'm just trying to help.
We don't need any of your help.
What?
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han... at the east... platform.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
R2, where have you been?
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.
Well, at least you're still in one piece.
Look what's happened to me.
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!
You have learned much, young one.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
All too easy.
Perhaps you're not as strong as the emperor thought.
Impressive.
Most impressive.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.
Now, release your anger.
Only your hatred can destroy me.
The security code has been changed.
R2, you can tell the computer to override the security systems.
R2, hurry.
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.
The Empire has taken control of the city.
I advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive.
This way.
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Falcon. It's fixed!
Just open the door, you stupid lump!
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!
That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!
Go!
I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.
Of course I've looked better.
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.
Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
There is no escape.
Don't make me destroy you.
You do not yet realize your importance.
You have only begun to discover your power.
Join me... and I will complete your training.
With our combined strength... we can end this destructive conflict... and bring order to the galaxy.
I'll never join you!
If you only knew the power of the dark side.
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
He told me enough.
He told me you killed him.
I am your father.
That's not true.
That's impossible!
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.
It is your destiny.
Join me... and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.
Come with me.
It is the only way.
Ben.
Ben, please.
Hear me.
- We've got to go back.
- What?
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?
Chewie, just do it.
All right, all right!
Alert my Stardestroyer to prepare for my arrival.
Look, someone's up there.
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.
Okay. Easy, Chewie.
- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.
All right, Chewie. Let's go.
I'll be back.
Stardestroyer.
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.
Punch it!
They told me they fixed it.
I trusted them!
It's not my fault!
They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.
Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun.
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light speed?
We can't?
How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
The city's central computer told you?
R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing.
Father.
Son, come with me.
Ben.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's Vader.
Luke, it is your destiny.
Why didn't you tell me?
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.
You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.
I'm standing here in pieces and you're having delusions of grandeur!
You did it!
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.
When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.
Take care, you two.
May the Force be with you.
SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE
- Nice! 
- An ideal family portrait... 
Look into the camera, please. 
Great!
How about giving us a smile?
Let's see some happy faces. 
You too, Mother... Great! 
Mind your hair! There we have it.
- That should do it, right?
- Yes, I think so.
- We've finished with the girls.
- You've been so good!
- Bye-bye!
- They were good as gold...
How about some shots of the parents on the sofa?
Lean forward, you're sliding too far back. That's it!
- I'll try and make myself small.
- Talk to each other.
Marianne, turn your eyes slightly towards us...
Look as if you were fond of each other... There, like that.
Hold that pose! Great...
- That's it. Thank you very much.
- Good!
We'll need some portraits later.
Well then, let's start, shall we?
I always begin with a standard question, to soothe the nerves.
- I'm not particularly nervous.
- Good. The question is:
How would you describe yourselves in a few words?
- That's not an easy one.
- Not all that difficult, surely?
- I may be misunderstood.
- Really?
It may sound conceited to say
I'm highly intelligent, youthful, successful, sensible, sexy and
I care about the world we live in.
I'm educated, well-read and a good mixer. Let's see...
I'm a good friend even to people who are worse off than myself.
I'm good at sports.
I'm a good husband and a good son.
I have no debts and I pay my taxes.
I respect our government, no matter what it does.
I love our royal family.
I've left the state church.
- Shall I go on?
- Please.
- I'm a splendid lover.
- Perhaps we can skip that question.
What about you, Marianne?
Well, what shall I say?
I'm married to Johan and I have two daughters...
- That's all I can think of...
- Come on, think harder.
- I think Johan is awfully nice...
- How kind of you.
- We've been married for 10 years.
- We've just renewed our contract.
Unlike Johan, I lack the ability to see myself in such glowing terms, but in all honesty, I'm glad
I'm able to lead the life I do.
It's a good life, if you know what I mean.
What else? My, this is difficult...
- She has a nice figure.
- I'm trying to be serious.
- I have two girls, Karin and Eva.
- You've already said that.
How about some personal data?
Let's start with your ages.
- I'm 42, but I don't look it.
- I'm 35.
Both of us come from obscenely middle-class homes.
- Johan's father is a doctor.
- And my mother is the motherly type.
My father is a lawyer.
It was decided from the outset that I was to be a lawyer too.
I'm the youngest of seven children.
Mother ran a big household.
- Nowadays, she takes it easy.
- Oh, does she?
Oddly enough, we get on with our parents. We see a lot of each other.
There's never been any friction to speak of.
Let's talk about your professions.
Mine is a bit unusual.
I'm an associate professor at the Institute of Psychotechnology.
Family law is my specialty. I belong to a large firm of solicitors.
Most of my work concerns divorce, but the interesting thing is...
Hold that pose!
Take a picture, I want to capture that expression. Good!
- My, I feel so...
- It will pass.
- Tell me, how did you meet?
- I'll leave that to Johan.
- Lord, that is interesting!
- It wasn't love at first sight.
We both had a large circle of friends and ran into each other often.
We were also both involved in politics for several years and we went in for amateur dramatics quite a lot as students.
Well, I can't say we made any deeper impression on each other.
Marianne thought I was stuck-up.
Johan had a rather highly publicized affair with a pop singer...
...which gave him a certain image and made him insufferable.
Marianne was 19.
She was married to a fool whose only saving grace was a rich father.
He was very kind and I was madly in love with him.
Besides, I got pregnant early on in the relationship.
- But how was it that...
- That the two of us joined forces?
That was actually Marianne's idea.
My baby died soon after birth and my husband and I divorced, to our mutual relief.
And Johan's singer had given him his walking papers.
We were both a bit hurt and Ionely, so I suggested making a go of it.
We weren't in love at all, but we were both downhearted.
And then we found out that we got along very well and we really buckled down to our studies.
We moved in together, a situation our mothers actually took in their stride.
In fact, they became good friends.
We were accepted as Johan and Marianne.
After six months we got married.
- By then we were in love as well.
- Very much so!
- We were seen as an ideal couple.
- And that's still the case.
- No complications?
- We've never had material worries.
We're on good terms with friends and relations on both sides.
We have good jobs that we enjoy.
We're healthy.
And so on, to an almost vulgar degree. Security, order, Ioyalty...
We're almost indecently lucky.
Naturally, we have our differences, just like other people.
But we agree on all the key issues.
- Don't you ever quarrel?
- Marianne does.
Johan is very slow to anger, so I run out of steam.
This all sounds wonderful. All of it.
Only last night someone was saying that the very lack of problems is a serious problem.
We are well aware that a life like ours can be dangerous.
How do you mean, dangerous?
The world is going to hell. I claim the right to mind my own business.
Live and let live, that's my motto.
It sickens me to hear about the latest panacea.
- I don't agree with Johan.
- So, what's your opinion?
- I believe in compassion.
- Please elaborate on that.
If people learned to care about each other in childhood, the world would be a different place.
Hold that pose!
Look into the camera, please.
Listen to this:
""Marianne's eyes, blue as an old folk song, are lit up from within."
When asked how she copes with a job and a household, she smiles with shy delight
"and replies that she and Johan help each other." That's true."
""We understand each other, she says," brightening as Johan sits down beside her on their heirloom sofa.
"He puts a protective arm around her and she snuggles up to him.""
- Hey!
- This is the best bit!
""So I leave, noticing that they seem pleased at the prospect" that they can once more be alone together.
Two people who have matured: strong, happy and positive.
"People who have never forgotten to give love pride of place"."
- We almost died when we read it.
- I was going to file a complaint.
But our mothers and our daughters simply loved the article.
What really riles me is that it says nothing about my eyes.
- Isn't there a secret glow in them?
- They're more like dark pools.
- Very sexy, actually.
- Katarina has a crush on you.
- Johan, will you elope with me?
- A change would do Johan good.
He's been so good for 10 years and has never been unfaithful.
Are you sure?
I believe everything Johan says.
- Did you hear that, Katarina?
- Johan is a better liar than you.
- But I have no imagination.
- That's just it.
- It makes you a better liar.
- Peter tarts up his stories.
At times I really find it touching.
I read your article in Technical Times.
Even I could understand it.
- Actually, Katarina wrote it.
- Are you that clever?
You see, I was in Germany and they wanted an article on the spot.
So Katarina wrote it and read it to me on the phone.
- But why did it have your by-line?
- It's not discrimination.
- We collaborate.
- That's admirable.
You wouldn't say that if you knew the details.
Things are rotten between us.
Cheers, Katarina, my poppet!
Cheers...
Does it bother you that I speak freely to Johan and Marianne?
- What is it, Katarina?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Only Peter can be so damn clumsy sometimes.
Clumsy is the right word...
I take pride in being clumsy... and imaginative.
The funny thing is that according to Katarina,
I am nothing but a spineless jellyfish.
- Jellyfish? Now you're talking.
- Let's try to enjoy ourselves now.
Exactly, because we mustn't forget...
I'm making a thank-you speech now.
Bearing in mind that fabulous magazine article reminding us that we are in a happy home that we must not soil with emotional rubbish.
Cheers, Marianne!
I may not envy your domestic bliss...
...but I envy your talent as a cook.
No, I really mean that.
I wish Katarina would learn to cook like that.
Katarina is a much better cook.
- Peter says I poison the food.
- It's a standing joke in our house.
- Right, it's obviously a joke.
- One that's seen better days.
Well, let's go into the drawing room and have coffee.
Well, Johan, what am I to do?
I've put my foot in it again.
The girls will clear the table.
- It's all too bloody touching.
- What is?
Your marriage.
Johan and Marianne...
It can move a person to tears.
In fact, it makes you want to stick a pin into your beautiful balloon.
- So would you?
- Cheers to you both!
- It's been 10 years, right?
- We just had our 10th anniversary.
- No skeletons in the cupboard?
- You never know.
- Both Johan and I like tidying up.
- You hear that, Katarina?
That's where you and I have been remiss... We never clean things up.
But next week I'll call Marianne and make an appointment, so she can get started on our divorce.
Peter will have changed his mind by the time he's sober.
That's when the calculator starts running.
"This is what he says:
"I'll agree to a divorce,"
"if Katarina gives up her claim to our assets in Switzerland.""
"And my reply is:
"But it's my money, I've earned it.""
Then Peter will say he has multiplied it and I can have the whole factory.
Then I say, that's nice of you to let me have a factory in Italy - that gets more risky with every rise in labour costs.
"- But Katarina, I've said...
- "Take the whole set-up in Sweden."
The apartment, the country house, the boat, the car,
"the shares and the premium bonds." Isn't that nice?"
I get all the taxable stuff!
Excuse me for going on about such trivial matters, but when Peter gets started on assets, I know how drunk he is.
- And the insults aren't far off.
- That's what I've said all along.
Katarina is a businessman, with equal stress on both words.
A businessman...
In addition to which, she's a brilliant artist and she has an IQ of I don't know what.
She's attractive as well.
She's a paragon, and gift-wrapped to boot.
How I ever got lucky with that monster of perfection is a mystery.
I really think we'll ring for a taxi and go home now.
This can't be pleasant for Johan and Marianne...
No... Johan and Marianne?
They're candy figurines decorated with red ribbons.
Just like the marzipan pigs of our childhood.
It's good for their moral fibre, to gaze into the bottomless pits of hell.
August Strindberg once wrote:
""Is there anything more fearsome"
"than a husband and wife who hate each other?""
What do you say?
Maybe child abuse is even worse.
But then Katarina and I are children.
Deep down, Katarina is a little girl who is crying because she has fallen down and no one comforts her.
And I haven't grown up either.
I cry because Katarina can't love me, in spite of my bad behaviour.
There's one thing to be grateful for.
That there is nothing more hellish than this.
That's why we're ready for a divorce.
Provided you listen to reason.
Provided we simultaneously, in each other's presence and in front of reliable witnesses, sign all the papers.
So no one can stiff the other.
- We'll call you up this week.
- We have a great business lawyer.
Borglund can help you with the financial arrangements.
What do you say?
Even if we agree on money matters, you'll never let me go.
I'm convinced of that.
You think you're that bloody indispensable, my dear Katarina?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Do tell me... Tell us.
You force me to have sex, since you can't get it up with other women.
Your need of a guilty conscience knows no bounds.
Now that it's all over with Jan
I expect you're in a panic.
You're stuck with old Peter.
He has the right patience.
So you think you're the only one, do you?
How touching...
You think there are no others.
Let me tell you one thing, Peter...
Please excuse me if I'm rather outspoken, but Peter is asking for it and he needs to be enlightened.
I'll tell you this, Peter...
You nauseate me so much...
...in a physical sense... that I'd buy myself a lay just to wash you out of my sex organs.
""Abide with me, fast falls the eventide"
"The darkness deepens,
Lord with me abide...""
You son of a bitch!
""When other helpers fail and comforts flee"
"Help of the helpless,
Oh, abide with me.""
Whatever that's supposed to mean...
I hope there won't be any stains on the carpet.
I don't know about liqueur...
Why don't you bill me?
Do as I say!
Would you mind pouring me a cup of coffee?
I'm pretty sloshed.
Forgive us.
We don't usually behave like this.
But you're our best friends.
You're our only friends.
Forgive me... Forgive us.
If you ring for a cab,
I'll take my bacchante home and we'll finish our little scene.
The finale is usually not suitable for an audience.
- What's the time?
- Ten past twelve.
- Thank goodness we got rid of them.
- Yes, things got a bit out of hand.
Do you believe it's possible for a couple to be partners for life?
It's an absurd convention.
Marriage should be a five-year contract.
- Or be subject to annual renewal.
- What about us?
No, we're the exception that proves the rule.
- So you think we'll stay together?
- What a funny question.
Are you ever sorry you can't sleep with anyone else?
- No, are you?
- At times.
- Well, I'll be damned!
- It's a purely theoretical longing.
I wonder if there's something wrong with me, I never feel like that.
- I'm content.
- So am I. Now I've got it!
Katarina and Peter go through hell because they don't communicate.
They have to translate everything they mean into a common language.
- I think it's simpler than that.
- We understand each other instantly.
We speak the same language, that's why we're doing fine.
I think it's the money.
If you speak the same language, money is not an issue.
- You and your languages.
- I see it all the time at work.
Sometimes it's as if the couple are talking on bad telephone lines.
Sometimes it's like listening to two pre-programmed tape recorders and sometimes it's the utter silence of outer space.
- I don't know which is the worst.
- I don't know...
Supposing the kids went to day care while we worked shifts at a factory?
- It wouldn't matter.
- I think it would.
If you speak the same language, it doesn't matter where you are.
That's a romantic view.
Do you think our relationship would suffer if we lived that kind of life?
- Yes, I do. Seriously.
- It would diminish our relationship?
"Regardless of our "language"."
Isn't the danger of estrangement just as great in the life we lead?
Definitely not.
Hard, tedious labour exposes people to much greater strain.
You're sillier than I thought and you're taking the romantic view.
- We'll see.
- What? What will we see?
- I don't know, do you?
- Are you teasing me?
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes, terribly.
How about some beer and sandwiches?
Sounds marvellous.
THE ART OF SWEEPING MATTERS
UNDER THE RUG
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a log and you?
Well, I woke up at 5 o'clock and couldn't get back to sleep again.
- Why not?
- I got all worked up.
- Should I feel guilty?
- No.
For once you're not to blame, dear.
I lay fuming about that wretched Sunday dinner.
We always have Sunday dinner with your parents or mine.
- It's absurd.
- It's for their sake.
- I'm going to cancel dinner.
- Cancel it?
- What will your mother say?
- Whatever she damned well likes.
I want to spend Sunday with you and the kids.
- Well, if you can swing that...!
- I certainly can!
I'm fed up...
- Is it the curse?
- You always say that!
Even if my period's due on Monday, that may not be why I'm edgy.
- What's wrong?
- Has it ever struck you that our life is mapped out and every last second is accounted for?
- But we have our vacations.
- They're even more scheduled.
- Aren't you going to wake the girls?
- They're sleeping in today.
Karin has the day off from school and Eva has a sore throat.
She needs to come along on Sunday to spare us from nagging!
- You were going to cancel dinner.
- I'd rather you did it.
Oh no, I'm not making excuses to your mother!
Aren't you going to call your mother?
She's an early bird.
- Didn't we agree you would call?
- No, dear.
I'll hold your hand in moral support.
All right, I'll do it...
- My, my heart's pounding!
- The first sign of the great revolt.
No answer? What a relief!
Hello. Miss Alm? Is my mother in?
May I have a word with her?
How is your knee, by the way?
Oh, it's not any better?
It's worse? That's too bad...
What does the doctor say?
He's not sympathetic, you say?
It's a sign of the times.
Hello, Mother. How are you?
Now isn't that nice.
Has Dad left yet?
Right, he was going to the country.
So you let him go off on his own like that?
Oh, Erik is with him. That's good.
I'm sorry, but there's something I have to tell you...
Exactly, how did you guess?
What reasons do we have?
I simply want to spend Sunday with Johan and the girls.
No, we're not going anywhere.
We just don't want to come over for dinner.
I don't think for a moment that dad was looking forward to Sunday.
It should be a pleasure and not a duty, right?
Yes, I see. I see.
You hadn't told me that bit of news.
Bored stiff, to be quite honest.
No, forget all about it, Mother.
We'll be there.
Yes, we'll manage. It's fine.
We're looking forward to it.
Bye for now, Mother dear.
The revolution was smothered at birth.
Aunt Elsa is coming and she was so looking forward to seeing us.
- She has a present for you.
- And Mrs Danielsson is cooking.
- And your dad longed to see us.
- Damnation!
I admire your courage all the same.
We'll say no another time.
Don't be upset.
- Will you be home for dinner?
- No, meet me at the theatre.
Don't you like coming home any more?
My, aren't we in a fine mood today?
I'd love to stay in bed for a week, so we could just hold each other.
- And we'd both have a good cry.
- That's not the life we chose.
If only I could be sure we chose it and not our mothers.
You're suffering from a maternal persecution complex.
- Did you want a life like this?
- No.
What if we started cheating on each other?
What would you do then?
Kill you, of course.
- Sometimes I wish...
- What?
Nothing...
- Wait a second, I'll come with you.
- Why not take your own car?
We can go home together after the play.
- What about the girls?
- I'll ask Miss Andersson to cook.
She makes fabulous pancakes.
I'll go wake the girls.
- But I'm in a hurry.
- It'll only take a minute.
While I remember it, please pay your parking tickets.
- There's a whole pile here.
- Yes, sir.
I'll see you tonight at the theatre.
Hello? Yes, speaking.
Hello, Mother. The line is bad,
I didn't recognise your voice.
I'm fine, how are you?
You're worried. Now, why is that?
Marianne's mother called and she's worried as well, you say.
Good Lord...
No, Marianne and I are doing fine.
We're healthy and cheerful and ecstatically happy.
Nothing's wrong, I swear!
Don't worry, Mother dear.
Your intuition? It's led you astray.
Marianne and I are happier than ever.
Tell Marianne's mother that you should do something more constructive than gossip.
I'm pressed for time, Mother dear.
Yes, I'll see you soon.
We'll pop in on Friday, just like we said. Say hello to dad.
Hell and damnation!
Am I disturbing you?
I just had to see what you're up to.
A lot of rumours are floating around.
What is all this mysterious stuff?
- Shouldn't you be in Lund?
- That's right.
However the students are demonstrating.
The lectures were cancelled.
- What's this going to be?
- Take a look.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Hold this pen.
When I put the lights out you'll see a bright dot on the wall.
Try and touch it with the pen.
If you miss, draw a line to it.
The TV camera will register your efforts.
- But it's dark.
- There's infra light.
I'll watch on the monitor outside.
I'll put the lights out now.
Off you go.
Get to it.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, please continue.
But... It keeps moving.
It's not a trick, it's quite still.
I've had enough of this.
Turn the lights on.
Well, aren't you cross?
- That was unpleasant...
- Yes, it makes people nervous.
Look how you've wandered, getting more and more irritated.
- What does that prove?
- That remains to be seen.
- I'd like a cigarette.
- Sure. Have a seat.
I gave up smoking six days ago.
It's awful.
- Having withdrawal symptoms?
- Stefan is away...
My friends avoid me, but I'll try and stick it out.
Go on, have one.
That spy Bromeus left some here.
Oh, that's heaven!
- Lord, what bliss!
- Well?
Right...
I spent the day reading your poems yesterday. Very carefully.
- They baffled me.
- Were they so strange?
That's not it.
Well, I might be wrong...
- Has Marianne read them?
- No, she's not interested in poetry.
- She ought to be interested in you.
- She is, but not in that way.
Really?
You and I are old friends.
We've never been sexually involved.
You can provide an objective opinion before I try the publishers.
- I shouldn't bother.
- Are they that bad?
It's not that they're bad...
...if only that was the case.
You mean they're mediocre?
They're insipid, neat, and puerile?
That I'm indulging in spiritual masturbation?
Several of us in our set believed you were destined for greatness.
We admired you.
You left us all behind.
We even envied you.
- Does that affect my poetry?
- No.
- You read it while craving nicotine.
- That's true...
I intend to show them around.
Naturally...
I'll wait until some publishers tell me they're bad.
- You feel offended.
- You bet I do!
I'm sorry.
Well, I know someone who likes them...
- Who would that be?
- Curious, are you?
My dear little Johan...
Pay no attention to what I said.
It was just my craving talking.
Well, I must go.
I'll leave the poems at your door.
Give my love to Marianne.
I'll stick to you through thick and thin.
Bye!
I'll see you around 12:30, then. Bye.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
During this first encounter, we customarily establish the problem.
I want a divorce.
- How long have you been married?
- More than 20 years.
- Do you have a profession?
- No, I'm a housewife.
Why do you want a divorce?
It's a loveless marriage.
- Is that your reason?
- Yes.
- Has it always been like this?
- Yes, for the full 20 years.
But now you want to break away.
Yes.
My husband is a responsible man.
He's kind and conscientious.
He's been an excellent father.
We've never quarrelled.
We have a nice apartment and a house in the country.
We're both fond of music.
We belong to a chamber music society.
- It all sounds ideal.
- Yes, doesn't it?
But there's no love between us, there never has been.
Forgive me for asking, but have you met someone?
No, I haven't.
What about your husband?
Not as far as I know.
Won't it be Ionely for you?
I guess so...
But that's better than living in a loveless marriage.
Have you informed your husband of this?
Naturally.
15 years ago, I told him
I didn't want to live with him.
He asked me to wait until the children had grown up.
Now that they've left home,
I can get my divorce.
And what does he say?
He keeps asking me what is wrong with our marriage.
I tell him I can't go on in a relationship that lacks love.
Then he asks what this love is supposed to consist of.
But I can't describe something that doesn't exist.
Have you been on good terms with your children?
I've never loved my children.
I know that now...
I used to think I did. People do.
But I know now that I never loved them.
I've been a good mother to them all the same.
I've done all I could, even though
I've never felt anything for them.
I know just what you're thinking:
""She's been overindulged and has no sense of humour."
She has all she could ever want, but still she moans about love.
There are other qualities:
"friendship, Ioyalty, security...""
Something like that, yes.
Let me tell you something.
I have a mental image of myself, which doesn't correspond to reality.
Forgive a personal question...
Isn't it so that love...
What were you going to ask?
I'm not sure. Forgive me.
I have the capacity to love.
But it's all been... bottled up.
The life I've led has stifled my potential.
The time has come to change that.
The first step is divorce.
My husband and I block each other in some deadly way.
That sounds frightening.
It is frightening.
Something peculiar is happening.
My senses, sight, hearing, touch are starting to fail me.
This table, for instance,
I can see it and touch it...
But the sensation is diminished and dry.
Do you understand?
I think I do.
It's the same with everything - music, scents, faces and voices.
Everything seems... puny, grey and undignified.
Now for a drink and some food.
Sitting through Ibsen on an empty stomach is deadly.
Remember when we joined the May Day procession?
You were the more fervent believer.
You told me I neglected our home.
That was the winter, we all came down with the Asian flu.
- We believed in the future then.
- It's nice to believe in something.
And we had the pleasure of annoying our parents.
- You were a hothead.
- So was your dad.
A pretty hothead. You were very attractive as a socialist.
Aren't I now? Very attractive?
But married people lose interest in each other.
We haven't.
We're just too busy. When evening comes around, we're exhausted.
That wasn't a reproach, I promise.
- We like each other.
- Not in that way.
- Oh yes, we do.
- Our life is full of evasions.
I can't help not enjoying it as much as I used to.
There's a natural explanation.
You shouldn't reproach me.
- Don't get upset.
- We have a fine sex life.
We're not as passionate nowadays, but it could be worse.
Sex isn't everything.
If you're not satisfied you'd better find a mistress who is more exciting sexually.
- I assure you, I do my best!
- Right...
You've got that look again.
Tell me what you're brooding about.
- You'll only get angry.
- No, I'm listening.
Why make sex so complicated?
It's pretty elementary stuff.
It's become such a sore spot.
It's all your mother's fault.
- You're so superficial.
- You're a sourpuss!
You put all the blame on me.
- You said you do your best.
- I do!
That's preposterous!
Are you calling me a liar?
Then what are you talking about?
Let's drop this and go to bed.
It's just like you to get me so worked up and then yawn and say it's bedtime.
You suffer from ferocious ambition.
It's something we often joke about, but can't our poor sex life be spared?
Why won't you leave me alone?
First you attack me for not trying and later for making the effort.
Now look what I've done!
Yes, indeed, you have.
Couldn't you be kind instead?
There, there... Don't be upset.
I'm sorry.
It's possible to talk too much about these matters, you know.
I know you shouldn't keep secrets, but in this case the rule is wrong.
There are some things you shouldn't pry into.
We hurt each other to no end and the barbs still remain when we go to bed.
It's like lying on a bed of nails.
- What are you laughing at?
- The bed of nails.
- It's all very well to laugh.
- Let's go to bed.
You've been unbelievably tactless.
I apologise.
Don't I give you enough affection?
Affection takes time.
- Then you don't get enough.
- We don't, or give enough either.
That's why I wanted us to go away this summer.
Affection shouldn't be kept for vacations.
You're nice, even if you are a moron.
Lucky I'm married to you.
You're mediocre, but you have your moments of greatness.
At our age, thousands of brain cells burn out every day.
- Never to be replaced...
- You must lose a million!
You're awfully sweet anyway, even if you do scold and fuss.
I'm nearly asleep already.
- I'll just go check on the children.
- I'm nearly asleep, so don't worry.
Aren't you going to set the alarm?
You may make love to me now if you like.
Thanks for the offer, but I'm too tired.
Here already? I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.
What a lovely surprise!
Are you hungry?
We all went to bed early.
We thought we'd have an early night.
The girls and I have been dieting.
- Would you like some sandwiches?
- Sounds good to me.
Or shall I fry you some eggs and ham, or fix some soup?
No, sandwiches and beer will do fine.
By the way, Peter and Katarina will call you on Monday.
What an ordeal they're having!
They don't seem able to decide about their divorce.
I told them to get a lawyer each, but they won't.
Listen, change into your pyjamas and I'll bring in a tray.
Sounds nice...
I was afraid you were angry with me.
- Why should I be?
- I was beastly on the phone.
I called back, but you'd pulled out the plug.
I was tired last night.
I'd been with that numbskull from the ministry.
Those bureaucratic idiots in charge of our well-being...
- I still think I behaved badly.
- Let's drop the subject.
You never want to finish talking about anything, but this won't take long, dear.
I just wanted to say that you were right, but so am I.
If you don't want to wear a tuxedo, that's your business.
- But I've a right to my own opinion.
- I hate wearing a tux.
It's a ridiculous outfit.
I feel like a dressed-up chimp.
Let's not start quarrelling.
Tux or no tux, I love you.
A tuxedo is hardly essential to our marriage.
- It seemed like that last night.
- I said I was wrong.
Watching you eat makes me hungry...
I need a sandwich.
I'm so hungry, I feel light-headed.
I've lost nearly two kilos this week.
Does it show?
I can feel it, though.
But it seems pointless at times...
Why should we grudge ourselves the good things in life?
Why can't we be fat and cheerful?
Remember
Aunt Miriam and Uncle David?
They were big, fat and cheerful.
They slept in that double bed of theirs, holding hands.
Content with each other the way they were.
Why can't we be like them, brimming with contentment?
What's the matter?
Are you upset?
Has something happened?
What's wrong?
Tell me.
I came here to tell you something.
I've gone and fallen in love.
It's quite absurd and probably all wrong...
I met her at that congress in June.
She was an interpreter.
She's a student of Slavic languages.
She's nothing much to look at.
You might even think she's ugly.
I've no idea what this will lead to.
I don't know a thing. I'm bewildered.
On some level I'm happy, but I have one hell of a guilty conscience about you and the girls.
We've always got along so well.
Things have been no better or no worse than in most families.
Say something, for Christ's sake.
I don't know what to say.
It was wrong not to tell you sooner, but I figured I'd get over it.
I didn't want to worry you.
It's funny...
...that I haven't noticed anything.
Everything's been like usual.
Better, in fact.
You've been so sweet.
I've been a silly blind fool.
I didn't understand...
- How mortifying.
- No, you haven't understood a thing.
You've never been particularly observant.
- Where do we go from here?
- I don't know.
Do you want a divorce?
Are you going to marry her?
Why tell me now? What's the rush?
We're leaving for Paris tomorrow.
I want to get away from it all.
I was going this autumn anyway.
Paula has this scholarship...
...and I want to be with her.
I can't make it without her.
So we're leaving tomorrow.
Now that I'm talking to you,
I want to ditch the whole damn thing.
I feel tired and scared.
Nothing could be more ridiculous.
I know just what you're thinking.
How could you know that?
I'm trying not to feel guilty, which has rather affected me.
Facts are facts, there's nothing to be done.
Let's go to bed. I expect you need to make an early start.
I have a meeting at nine.
Then we should get some sleep.
Aren't you going to undress?
You have marks on your chest.
How tactless of you.
Is my grey suit here or in town?
- It's at the cleaners.
- What a shame.
Did you want to bring it along?
Can't you go and pick it up?
I won't have the time.
I'm busy right up to 3 o'clock.
I can pick it up for you.
I'll do your packing, too.
You're no good at such things.
- No, thank you.
- Don't be silly...
I'm a bit conventional.
I think you have all you need here.
There are clean shirts and underwear.
Why don't you travel in your jacket and flannels?
- They give you a youthful air.
- Whatever you say...
- How long will you be away?
- It depends.
What do you mean?
I've taken leave of absence for at least six months.
I'll probably stay away for at least seven or eight months.
I want to make a clean break.
- And if I'm not here?
- I couldn't care less.
Do you know how long
I've wanted to leave?
How long
I've thought about leaving you?
- Don't tell me!
- Four years!
- I can't take this!
- Empty words...
What are you going to live on?
You'll have to pay child support.
Don't worry, I'll manage.
You must have assets
I'm not aware of.
That is correct, Marianne.
- How is that possible?
- Listen, damn it!
Even though it's none of your damn business,
I've sold the boat and I've raised a loan.
The bank will pay you and the girls
1,600 krona a month.
We'll make some other arrangement when I return.
Get advice from your colleagues,
I don't care.
Name your price!
I'm not taking a thing apart from my books.
I'll just vanish.
I'll dematerialize.
I'll pay all I can to support you.
All that interests me is to end this.
Do you know what I'm most fed up with?
All this carping about what we're expected to do and the people we must accommodate.
What will your mother think?
Hadn't we better ask so-and-so to dinner?
We have to go here, we have to go there...
We must celebrate
Christmas, Easter, birthdays...
Every single damn occasion!
- My poor darling...
- I don't want your sympathy!
Stop pawing me!
This is pure affectation, my running on like this.
I can't get at the truth about us.
There isn't any one truth.
Whichever way we turn, it hurts.
Please don't go!
- I beg you.
- It's no use.
Postpone your trip.
I believe we can save our marriage.
We could make a fresh start.
You must give me a chance!
Perhaps Paula would understand me.
I should meet her and talk to her...
Let us face this together.
Let me have a chance!
You're facing me with a fait accompli.
You're forcing me into an intolerable situation.
You mean:
What are our parents going to say!
What will our friends think?
Jesus, how tongues will wag!
How will it affect the girls?
What about the dinner parties?
What will you tell Peter and Katarina? Who cares?
It feels good to be a cad!
That wasn't what I meant.
Forget it...
I forgot to set the alarm.
- When do you need to leave?
- Please set it for 5:30.
I need to pack and I have a conference at nine.
I've been meaning to get a new alarm clock.
This one's so noisy and it's not very reliable.
There, it's set for 5:30.
I'll wake up on my own anyway, so you needn't worry.
- Tell me about Paula.
- Please... What's the point?
- Why torment yourself?
- I want to know what she's like.
It's much worse picturing some faceless threat.
- Do you have a picture of her?
- Can't we be spared this ordeal?
Please help me with this.
Well, you asked for it...
Where's my wallet?
I guess it's in my jacket...
Here are two photos.
That was taken two years ago, on holiday.
That is her passport photo.
It's a good likeness.
She has a nice figure.
- And lovely breasts, right?
- Yes, she does...
- Does she dye her hair?
- It's possible.
- Her smile is nice. How old is she?
She hasn't been lucky in love.
She's been engaged twice and has had lots of affairs.
- Does that bother you?
- Yes, it does...
Her frankness is quite unpleasant.
She insists on giving me the details of her erotic past.
I suffer from retrospective jealousy.
She has no illusions and she has no great hopes for the two of us.
She knows I'll go back to you.
It all sounds like a hackneyed old melodrama.
Are you compatible in bed?
Yes, we are, actually.
At first it was all wrong.
I wasn't used to it - being with other women, I mean.
We've spoiled each other, you and I, living in a bubble of our own.
Everything's gone like clockwork.
- The lack of oxygen smothered us.
- And Paula will revive you?
I have little self-awareness.
I know little of reality, regardless of all the books I've read, but this may be an opportunity for you and I to really live.
Has Paula filled your head with rubbish like that?
- Just how naive can you get?
- We can do without your taunts.
- Forgive me.
- I'm trying...
I'm trying to be honest and it's not easy!
We've never talked like this before.
Is it any wonder we're naive?
What else can we expect?
You're in a tight spot.
Come and lie down beside me.
Come...
I want you to make love to me.
Please?
For old time's sake.
Lie here in my arms and we'll both go to sleep together.
I don't think I can sleep.
I'd better leave at once.
Close your eyes.
We both need the rest.
Tomorrow will be a busy day.
I'm so damned ashamed.
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, it's just the two of us.
We still have a few hours left.
Just you and I...
- Are you going to pack first or eat?
- You decide.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.
- What about your mail?
- I'll send you my address.
You can send the letters on, pay the bills in the usual way.
The plumber was scheduled to come to fix the bathroom.
Shall I call him?
I figured it might have slipped your mind.
I've phoned him dozens of times,
I haven't forgotten it.
What about your car?
I've asked Paula's sister to take care of it.
She needs a car.
I see.
Would you please cancel my dentist's appointment?
It's your father's birthday on
Friday, we're supposed to dine there.
Are you planning to phone him?
That's tricky...
Maybe I can write him a letter.
As long as you don't forget.
Dealing with our parents will be tough.
- What should I tell the girls?
- Say whatever you like.
- That you walked out on us?
- You couldn't have put it better.
I don't expect you to understand me.
I have to leave now, to avoid traffic.
Goodbye, Marianne. Take care.
- I may be home in a week's time.
- I wish...
We'd make a fresh start.
We'd throw out stale old routines.
We'd talk about the past.
We'd try and find out where we went wrong.
You'd never hear me blame you.
Johan, it's all so unreal...
I don't know what to do.
You're shutting me out.
Any solution would be better than this.
Couldn't you promise to come back?
Then I'd have something, at least.
You can't leave me without hope.
Even if you don't intend to return, tell me you will.
I have to go now.
Fredrik? It's Marianne.
Sorry to wake you.
Is Birgit there? No, let her sleep.
So, how are you doing?
Oh, you're an early riser, are you?
I won't keep you long.
It's cloudy... That sounds lovely.
There's something
I need to talk to you about.
I really need to talk...
You and Birgit are friends of ours.
I have to...
It's all so unreal, Fredrik.
You see...
I'm on the verge of tears and crying only makes things worse.
[Traffic light dings]
[Truck honking]
[Tires screeching]
[Knocking]
[Knocking]
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.
Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.
You look kind of all in, at that. I'm fine.
How is the insurance business, Mr. Neff? Okay.
They wouldn't ever sell me any.
They said I have something loose in my heart.
[Chuckles]
I say it's rheumatism.
Yeah?
Twelve.
[Clicking]
[Exhaling]

[Buzzing stops]
Office memorandum.
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.
Dear Keyes...
I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it.
Well, I don't like the word confession.
I just want to set you right about something you couldn't see... because it was smack up against your nose.
You think you're such a hot potato as a Claims Manager... such a wolf on a phony claim.
Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim.
Accident and double indemnity.
You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes.
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.
You said it was murder. Check.
You thought you had it cold, didn't you?
All wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it.
It was perfect.
Except it wasn't, because you made one mistake... just one little mistake.
When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy.
You want to know who killed Dietrichson?
Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.
I killed Dietrichson.
Me, Walter Neff, insurance salesman.
35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars... until a while ago, that is.
Yes, I killed him.
I killed him for money... and for a woman.
And I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.
Pretty, isn't it?
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing stops]
It all began last May.
Around the end of May, it was.
I'd been out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks.
On the way back I remembered this auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.
So I drove over there.
It was one of those
California Spanish houses...
everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.
This one must've cost somebody about $30,000.
That is, if he ever finished paying for it.
[Doorbell ringing]
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?
Who wants to see him? My name is Neff. Walter Neff.
If you're selling something... Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to... and it's not magazine subscriptions.
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in. How soon do you expect him?
He'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.
Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.
It's about some renewals on the automobiles.
I've been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks... but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?
The insurance ran out on the 15th.
I'd hate to think of your having a smashed fender... or something while you're not... fully covered.
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.
I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...
Oh, that's all right.
If you'll wait till I put something on, I'll be right down.
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.
Where would the living room be?
In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.
(Walter) The living room was still stuffy...
from last night's cigars.
The windows were closed...
and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds...
showed up the dust in the air.
On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...
his daughter by his first wife.
They had a bowl of those little red goldfish...
on the table behind the big davenport.
But to tell you the truth, Keyes...
I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then.
Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.
I was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me...
and I wanted to see her again, close...
without that silly staircase between us.
I wasn't long, was I? (Walter)
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.
With two "F's," like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.
What story?
The Philadelphia Story.
Suppose we sit down and you tell me about the insurance.
My husband never tells me anything.
Well, it's on your two cars, the LaSalle and the Plymouth.
We've been handling this insurance for Mr. Dietrichson for three years... and we'd hate to see the policies lapse.
That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.
As I was saying, we'd hate to see the policies lapse.
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.
I guess he's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields.
Couldn't I catch him at home some evening for a few minutes?
I suppose so. But he's never home much before 8:00.
That's fine with me.
You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you?
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.
No, he isn't.
Well, then he'd have to join the club and pay the membership fee to start with.
I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.
The Automobile Club's fine. I can do just as well for you, though.
I have a very attractive policy here.
It wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband.
For instance, we're writing a new kind of 50% retention feature... in the collision coverage.
You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff?
Well, I've been at it 11 years. Doing pretty well?
It's a living.
You handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds?
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, public liability, group insurance... industrial stuff and so on, right down the line.
Accident insurance?
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.
[Chuckles]
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.
Just my name.
As, for instance?
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?
I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times.
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30?
He'll be in then.
Who?
My husband. You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea... if you know what I mean.
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.
Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.
Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.
Suppose it doesn't take.
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.
Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.
Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.
That tears it.
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.
Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?
I wonder if I know what you mean.
I wonder if you wonder.
(Walter) It was a hot afternoon and I can still remember...
the smell of honeysuckle all along that street.
How could I have known that murder can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?
Maybe you would have known, Keyes...
the minute she mentioned accident insurance, but I didn't.
I felt like a million.
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.
It was the day you had that truck driver from Inglewood on the carpet.
Remember, Keyes?
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.
Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little?
Park this for me, will you, sweetheart?
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.
You're not kidding anybody with that line of bull.
You're in a jam and you know it. Says you.
All I want is my money. Says you.
All you're gonna get is the cops. Hello, Walter.
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?
I ain't so good. My truck burned down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.
Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk.
Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones.
How do I know? Because my little man tells me.
What little man?
The little man in here.
Every time one of these phonies comes along, it ties knots in my stomach.
I can't eat.
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's how I knew your claim was crooked.
So what did I do?
I sent a tow car over to your garage this afternoon... and they jacked up that burned-out truck of yours.
And what did they find?
They found what was left of a neat pile of shavings.
What shavings?
The ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on.
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy. Maybe I made a mistake.
That's one way of putting it.
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.
Here. Just a minute. Sign this and you'll feel fine.
Sign what? It's a waiver on your claim. Right here.
Here?
Here.
Now you're an honest man again. Goodbye, Garlopis.
But I ain't got no more truck.
$2,600 is lot of dough where I live.
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't you know how to open the door?
Just put your hand on the knob, turn it to the left.
Now pull it toward you.
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?
Are we an insurance company, or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs... to write a policy on a mug like that?
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application... to have him thoroughly investigated... before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.
I'm not beefing at you. It's the company. It's the way they do things.
The way they don't do things!
The way they'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet.
And I'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims... so they won't throw more money out the window than they take in at the door.
Okay, turn the record over, let's hear the other side.
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen... dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy... who sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes.
Walter, I've had 26 years of this and let me tell you, I'm getting...
Yeah, and you've loved every minute of it, Keyes.
You love it, only you worry about it too darn much, you and your little man.
You're so darn conscientious, you're driving yourself crazy.
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday unless you looked at the calendar.
Then you'd check to see if it was this year's or last year's calendar.
Then you'd find out who printed the calendar...
and find out if their calendar checked with the World Almanac's calendar.
Now, that's enough from you, Walter.
Now, get out of here before I throw my desk at you.
[Flicking match]
I love you, too.
(Walter) I really did, too, you old crab...
always yelling your head off, always sore at everybody.
But you never fooled me with your song and dance. Not for a second.
I kind of always knew that behind the cigar ashes on your vest...
you had a heart as big as a house.
Back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson...
about the renewals.
She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.
She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at 3:30 instead.
I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon...
including a trip down to Santa Monica...
to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance.
But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson...
and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg.
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?
I'm considering it.
I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment.
Last night wasn't so convenient. That's all right.
I was working on my stamp collection anyway.
I was just fixing some iced tea. Would you like a glass?
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle of beer that's not working.
There may be some. I never know what's in the icebox.
Nettie.
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll renew with you, he told me so.
As a matter of fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon.
But he's not?
No.
[Chuckles]
That's terrible.
Nettie!
Oh, I forgot, today's the maid's day off.
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.
As long as it's the maid's day off, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.
Not much money, but you learn a lot about life.
I didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course.
Where'd you pick up this tea drinking?
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.
Born right here in Los Angeles.
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?
Walter.
That's right.
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance, how much commission do you make?
Twenty percent. Why?
I thought perhaps I could throw a little more business your way.
I can always use it. I was thinking about my husband.
I worry a lot about him down in those oil fields.
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?
He doesn't just sit behind a desk.
He's right down there with those drilling crews.
It's got me worried sick.
You mean, some dark night a crown block might fall on him?
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.
The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman.
He's in the hospital with a broken back. That's bad.
It's got me jittery just thinking about it.
Suppose something like that happened to my husband.
It could.
Well... don't you think he ought to have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.
What kind of insurance could he have?
Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills.
Say $125 a week cash benefit.
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
I suppose you have to think of everything in your business.
Well, your husband would understand.
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea of some accident protection.
Why don't I talk to him about it?
You could try, but he's pretty tough-going.
They're all tough at first.
He has a lot on his mind.
He doesn't seem to want to listen to anything... except maybe a baseball game on the radio.
Sometimes we sit here all evening and never say a word to each other.
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.
Is that what you married him for?
Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.
Anytime his thumbs get tired...
Only, with me around, you wouldn't have to knit.
Wouldn't I? You bet your life, you wouldn't.
Wonder if a little rum would get this up on its feet.
I want to ask you something, Walter.
Could I get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all?
How's that, again?
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.
I have a little allowance of my own.
I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.
Why shouldn't he know?
Because he doesn't want accident insurance.
He's superstitious about it. A lot of people are. That's funny, isn't it?
If there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over.
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.
You mean you want him to have the policy without him knowing it.
And that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know it.
That's the setup, isn't it? Is there anything wrong with it?
No, I think it's lovely.
Then, if some dark, wet night, that crown block did fall on him...
What crown block?
Only sometimes it can't quite make it on its own, it has to have a little help.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block.
It can be a car backing over him, or he could fall out of the upstairs window.
Any little thing like that, just so it's a morgue job.
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?
Look, baby, you can't get away with it.
You want to knock him off, don't you?
That's a horrible thing to say.
What'd you think
I was, anyway?
A guy that walks into a good looking dame's front parlor and says:
"Good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands.
"You got one that's been around too long?
"One you'd like to turn into a little hard cash?
"Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect. "
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.
I think you're swell, so long as I'm not your husband.
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.
I'll get out of here, but quick.
(Walter) So I let her have it straight between the eyes.
She didn't fool me for a minute, not this time.
I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker...
and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off.
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer, the one I had wanted all along...
only I wanted it worse now, to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...
and everything that went with it.
I didn't want to go back to the office so I dropped by a bowling alley...
at Third and Western and rolled a few lines...
to get my mind thinking about something else for a while.
I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.
So, I drove home, put the car away and went up to my apartment.
It had begun to rain outside and I watched it get dark...
and didn't even turn on the light.
That didn't help me either.
I was all twisted up inside...
and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker.
And right then it came over me that I hadn't walked out on anything at all.
That the hook was too strong...
that this wasn't the end between her and me.
It was only the beginning.
[Doorbell ringing]
So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd know who it was without even having to think.
As if it was the most natural thing in the world.
Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?
Sure.
Put it on the chair.
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.
It's raining.
Yeah.
Peel off your coat and sit down.
Your husband out?
Yes. Long Beach. They're spudding in a new well.
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.
It's about time you said you were glad to see me.
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.
I must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression.
You must never think anything like that about me, Walter.
Okay.
No, it's not okay.
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to be nice to me.
Like the first time you came to the house.
It can't be like the first time.
Something's happened.
I know it has.
It's happened to us.
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.
He keeps me on a leash so tight I can't breathe.
He's in Long Beach, isn't he? Relax.
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?
If you want to.
Right now?
Sure, right now.
[Walter sighing]
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.
You ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it.
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.
Bourbon is fine, Walter.
Get a couple of glasses, will you?
Club soda?
Plain water, please.
You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub... and knocked himself cold and was drowned.
Only he had accident insurance.
So they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.
Who didn't?
His wife.
Then there was a case of a guy who was found shot.
His wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way.
All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.
Perhaps it was worth it to her.
See if you can carry that as far as the living room.
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?
A colored woman comes in a couple of times a week.
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.
Get the rest down at the corner drugstore. Sounds wonderful.
Just strangers beside you.
You don't know them and you don't hate them.
You don't have to sit across the table... and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life.
What daughter? You mean the little girl on the piano?
Lola. She lives with us.
He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.
I suppose because it'd cost him too much money.
He hasn't got any money. Not since he went into the oil business.
But he had when you married him?
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?
But that's not the only reason. I was his wife's nurse.
She was sick a long time. When she died, he was terribly broken up.
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.
Every time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off.
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.
He's always been mean to me.
Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his.
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?
No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him.
So you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas.
Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did.
Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.
Only sometimes you wish he was dead. Perhaps I do.
Then you wish it was an accident, and you had that policy for $50,000.
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.
The other night we drove home from a party. He was drunk again.
When we drove into the garage, he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel... and the motor still running.
And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off... just closed the garage doors and left him there.
I'll tell you what it'd be like.
If you had that accident policy and tried to pull a monoxide job...
We've got a guy in our office named Keyes.
For him a setup like that'd be just like a slice of rare roast beef.
In three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident.
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights.
In a half-hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.
But, Walter, I didn't do it and I'm not going to do it.
Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby.
They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys.
And if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer.
They'll hang you just as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar.
And I don't want you to hang, baby.
Stop thinking about it, will you?
(Walter)
So we just sat there.
She started crying softly, like the rain on the window, and we didn't say anything.
Maybe she had stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't.
I couldn't.
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.
Since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.
Because you know how it is, Keyes.
In this business you can't sleep... for trying to figure out all the tricks they could pull on you.
You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel... watching the customers to make sure they don't crook the house.
And then one night, you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself.
And do it smart.
Because you've got that wheel right under your hands.
You know every notch in it by heart.
And you figure all you need is a plant out front.
A shill to put down the bet.
And suddenly the doorbell rings... and the whole setup is right there in the room with you.
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself.
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.
The stakes were $50,000, but they were the life of a man, too.
A man who'd never done me any dirt, except... he was married to a woman he didn't care anything about.
And I did.
Will you phone me? Walter?
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?
They're not going to hang you, baby.
It's better than going on this way.
They're not gonna hang you because... you're gonna do it and I'm gonna help you.
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.
We're gonna do it and we're gonna do it right.
And I'm the guy that knows how. Walter, you're hurting me.
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.
It's got to be perfect.
Call me tomorrow. But not from your house. From a booth.
And watch your step every single minute.
This has got to be perfect, you understand? Straight down the line.
Straight down the line.
[Rain pattering]
[Car engine starts]
[Car driving away]
(Walter)
That was it, Keyes.
The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it.
The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy.
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted was his signature on an application.
So I had to get him to sign without his knowing what he was signing.
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.
I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes... because I wanted all the answers ready... for all the questions you were gonna spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.
Everything looked fine, except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in.
It was Dietrichson's daughter, Lola.
And it made me feel a little queer in the belly... to have her sitting right there in the room, playing Chinese checkers...
as if nothing were going to happen.
(Walter) I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson... that, not being an employee... you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.
The only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own.
Yeah, I know all about that.
The next thing you'll tell me I need... earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance.
If we bought all the insurance they can think up... we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?
What keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack.
Who needs a hat in California?
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson... accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy.
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.
Just as you say.
Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight.
Sure.
All we'll need on that is for you to sign the application for renewal.
Phyllis, do you mind if we don't finish this game?
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?
Yes, I have.
Father, is it all right if I run along now?
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?
It better not be that Zachetti guy.
If I ever catch you with that...
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.
And I also told you we're going roller-skating.
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont and Franklin, the northwest corner... in case you're interested, and I'm late already.
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Phyllis. Good night, Miss Dietrichson.
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.
Good night, Mr. Neff.
A great little fighter for her weight.
Now, if you'll just sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.
Sign what? The applications for the auto renewals.
So you'll be covered until the new policies are issued.
When will that be?
About a week.
Just so I'm covered when I drive up north.
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.
And he still goes to his class reunion every year.
What's wrong with that? Can't I have a little fun, even once a year?
Great football school,
Stanford.
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?
The bottom line.
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?
Yes. One is the agent's copy.
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.
Don't worry about the check, I can pick it up at your office some morning.
How much you taking me for?
I think that's enough insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.
Plenty.
Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.
I think you left your hat in the hall, Mr. Neff.
Good night, Mr. Neff.
All right, Walter?
Fine.
He signed it, didn't he? Sure he signed it. You saw him.
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?
End of the month.
He drives, huh?
He always drives.
Not this time. You're gonna make him take the train.
Why? Because it's all worked out for a train.
Listen, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy... a little thing called double indemnity.
The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers.
That means they pay double on certain accidents.
The kind that almost never happen.
Like for instance, if a guy is killed on the train... they pay $100,000 instead of $50,000.
I see. We're hitting it for the limit, baby.
That's why it's got to be the train.
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.
Straight down the line.
Hello, Mr. Neff.
It's me.
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.
For me? Why?
I thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way.
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.
Going roller-skating, huh?
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.
Only tonight you're leaving it? Yes, I am.
I'm having a very tough time at home.
My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me.
Sounds tough, all right. That's why I have to lie sometimes.
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?
It's Vermont and Franklin all right.
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.
You won't tell on me, will you?
I'd have to think it over. Nino's not what my father says at all.
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC... and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown.
Got behind in his credits, flunked out.
Then he lost his job for talking back. He's so hot-headed.
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?
Guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for his daughter... except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.
I suppose it will sometime. This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.
Nino? Over here, Nino.
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.
The name is Zachetti.
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house.
I told him all about us.
Why does he have to get told about us?
We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.
I'm not doing any worrying.
Just don't you broadcast so much.
Well, what's the matter with you, Nino?
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.
If I did, I like to pick them myself. Come on.
Look, sonny, she needed a ride, so I brought her along.
Is that anything to get tough about?
All right, Lola, make up your mind. Are you coming or aren't you?
Of course I'm coming.
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.
You're awfully sweet. Nino?
(Walter)
She was a nice kid.
Maybe he was a little better than he sounded.
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all...
with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it...
and what that signature meant.
It meant he was a dead pigeon.
It was only a question of time, and not very much time at that.
You know that big market up on Los Feliz, Keyes?
That's the place Phyllis and I had picked for a meeting place.
I already had most of the plan in my head...
but a lot of details had to be worked out.
And she had to know them all by heart when the time came.
We had to be very careful from now on.
We couldn't let anybody see us together.
We couldn't even talk to each other on the telephone.
Not from her house or at my office, anyway.
So she was to be in the market every morning about 11:00, buying stuff.
And I could sort of run into her there any day I wanted to.
Sort of accidentally on purpose.
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.
I wanted to talk to you, ever since yesterday.
Let me talk first.
It's all set.
The accident policy came through. I've got it in my pocket.
I got his check, too. I saw him down in the oil fields.
He thought he was paying for the auto insurance.
The check's just made out to the company, so it could be for anything.
But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see?
It’ll be all right that way, because one of the cars is in your name.
Open your bag. Quick.
[Cash register bell dinging]
Can you get in the safe-deposit box?
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.
But don't put the policy in there yet. I'll tell you when.
Remember, you never saw it, you never even touched it, you understand?
I'm not a fool. Okay. When is he leaving on the train?
That's just it. He isn't going. What?
That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off.
What happened?
Mister, could you reach me that package of baby food?
That one up there?
I don't know why they always put what I want on the top shelf.
Go ahead. I'm listening.
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?
Until he can take the train.
I told you it's got to be the train.
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with.
There are other ways. We're not gonna do it other ways.
But we can't leave it like this.
What do you suppose would happen if he found out about the accident policy?
Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death house.
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's start losing our heads, that's all.
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.
[Cash register bell dinging]
Excuse me.
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.
It's the waiting that's getting me.
It's getting me just as bad, baby.
But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only... it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.
I better go, baby. I'm thinking of you every minute.
(Walter) After that, a full week went by and I didn't see her once.
I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea.
I kept telling myself that maybe those Fates they say watch over you...
had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out.
Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.
You came into my office around 3:00 in the afternoon.
Hello, Keyes.
I just came from Norton's office.
The semiannual sales records are out.
You're high man, Walter. That's twice in a row. Congratulations.
Thanks. How would you like a cheap drink?
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?
Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny? No, I'm serious.
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.
Too much pressure on my nerves.
I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed.
I've got to have an assistant and I thought of you.
Me? Why pick on me?
Well, because I've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job.
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.
Yeah. A peddler, a gladhander, a backslapper.
You're too good to be a salesman.
Nobody's too good to be a salesman. Phooey!
All you guys do is just ring doorbells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.
What's troubling you is that $50 cut, isn't it?
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.
The job I'm talking about takes brains and integrity.
It takes more guts than there is in 50 salesmen.
It's the hottest job in the business.
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.
I don't want to be nailed to a desk. Desk job?
Is that all you can see in it?
Just a hard chair to park your pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five sharp pencils... and a scratch pad to make figures on, maybe a little doodling on the side.
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.
To me, a claims man is a surgeon, that desk is an operating table... and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels.
And those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation.
They're alive.
They're packed with drama... with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.
A claims man, Walter, is a doctor and a bloodhound and a...
[telephone ringing]
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound and a cop and a judge and a jury... and a father confessor, all in one.
And you want to tell me you're not interested?
You don't want to work with your brains?
All you want to work is with your finger on the doorbell... for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter.
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?
No, you can't. I've only got a minute. It can't wait.
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train. Are you listening?
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.
Only, make it snappy, will you? He's on crutches.
The doctor says he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good.
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it, on a train.
Only with the crutches it makes it much better, doesn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, that's 100% better.
Hold the line a minute, will you?
Keyes, suppose I join you in your office? That's all right. I'll wait.
Only tell her not to take all day.
Go ahead.
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.
It's still the same dark street, isn't it?
And the signal is three honks on the horn. Okay. Anything else?
No.
Oh, uh... what color did you pick?
Blue. Navy blue. And the cast is on his left leg.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, that suits me fine.
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.
But it's straight down the line for both of us.
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?
If I told you it was a customer...
Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.
Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter?
Why don't you, for instance? I almost did, once. Long time ago.
Now look, Keyes, I've got to call on a prospect.
Even had the church picked out, the dame and I.
She had a white satin dress with flounces on it.
I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring.
And then suddenly that little man in here started working on me.
So you went back and had her investigated?
Yeah. And the stuff that came out...
She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was 16.
There was a manic depressive in her family, on her mother's side.
She already had one husband.
He was a professional pool player in Baltimore.
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.
She was a tramp from a long line of tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.
Now what do I say to Norton? What about this job I want you for?
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.
Only get this,
I picked you for the job... not because I think you're so darn smart... but because I thought you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit.
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.
You're just a little taller.
(Walter)
Yes, Keyes.
Those Fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off.
Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed.
The time for thinking had all run out.
I wanted my movements accounted for up to the last possible moment.
So when I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.
That was part of my alibi.
From here on, it was a question of following the timetable...
move by move.
I got home about 7:00 and drove right into the garage.
This was another item to establish my alibi.
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.
How about giving the heap a wash job?
How soon you gonna want it?
I got a couple cars ahead of you.
Any time you get to it, Charlie.
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.
(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...
one of the salesmen that shared my office.
He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll call and there'd be a record of it.
I told him I'd forgotten my rate book and needed some dope...
on the public liability bond
I was figuring.
I changed into a navy blue suit like Dietrichson was going to wear.
Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures.
I stuffed a hand towel and a roll of adhesive into my pockets...
so I could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg.
Next, I stuck a card inside the telephone box...
so that it would fall down if the bell rang.
That way I'd know if anybody had called me while I was away.
Then I did the same thing to the doorbell in case anybody came to see me.
I left the apartment by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.
I walked all the way from my apartment to the Dietrichson house.
I didn't want to take the bus...
because there was always the chance that someone might remember seeing me on it.
I was being that careful.
I could smell that honeysuckle again.
Only it was even stronger, now that it was night.
I slid the garage door open as quietly as I could.
She'd backed the sedan in, just the way I told her to.
I'd figured it was safer that way...
in case he got into the car before she drove it out.
I got into the back of the car.
I lay there on the floor and waited.
All the time I was thinking about that dark street on the way to the station...
where I was to do it...
and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal.
About 10 minutes later they came down.
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'll have the car out in a second.
[Inaudible]
Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time. Yeah.
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless... you might end up with a shorter leg.
So what? I could break the other one and match them up again.
It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it?
It's only for four days. I'll be back Monday at the latest.
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?
[Honking]
What are you doing that for?
What are you honking the horn for?
[Dietrichson choking]
[Train horn blowing]
[Bell ringing]
You take care of the redcap and the conductor.
Don't worry. Keep away from me as much as you can.
Tell them I don't want to be helped. I said, don't worry, Walter.
You start as soon as the train leaves.
When you get to the refinery, turn off the highway onto the dirt road.
From there it's exactly eight-tenths of a mile... to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.
I remember everything.
No speeding.
You don't want any cops stopping you with him in the back.
Walter, we've been through all that so many times.
When you leave the highway, turn off all your lights.
I'll be back on the observation platform.
I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.
Let the train pass, then dim your lights twice.
San Francisco train, lady? Car
9, section 11. Just my husband.
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.
Thank you. My husband doesn't like to be helped.
Car number 8. Up there.
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.
Here're the tickets. Take good care of yourself with that leg.
Yeah. You take it easy driving home.
I'll miss you, honey.
Section 11, sir.
(Porter) All aboard! Thank you.
Goodbye, honey.
All aboard!
[Train whistle blowing]
Good luck, honey.
Porter, will you make up my berth right away?
Yes, sir.
I'm going back to the observation car for a smoke.
Right this way, sir.
[Train whistle blowing]
Like a chair?
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.
You going far?
Palo Alto.
My name's Jackson.
I'm going all the way to Medford. Medford, Oregon.
I had a broken arm once.
That darn cast itches something fierce, doesn't it?
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.
Palo Alto's a nice little town. You a Stanford man?
I used to be. I'll bet you left something behind.
I always do.
My cigar case. I guess I left it in my overcoat back in the section.
Would you care to roll yourself a cigarette, Mister...
Dietrichson.
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.
Car 9, section 11. Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.
Okay. This has gotta be fast.
Here, take his hat. Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.
Okay, baby. That's it.
[Engine faltering]
[Engine choking]
[Engine starting]
All right. Let's go.
(Walter) On the way back, we went over once more...
what she was to do at the inquest...
if they had one, and about the insurance, when that came up.
I was afraid she might go to pieces a little, now that we had done it.
But she was perfect. No nerves. Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.
She dropped me a block from my apartment house.
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?
It's straight down the line, isn't it?
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.
It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.
Nobody saw me this time either. In the apartment I checked the bells.
The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.
Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.
I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.
You gonna use your car, after all? I'm not quite through.
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.
Just going up to the drugstore to get something to eat.
Been working upstairs all night. My stomach's getting a little sore at me.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.
That was all there was to it.
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.
There was nothing to give us away.
And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drugstore...
suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.
It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me.
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.
It was the walk of a dead man.
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes... and the next day was worse, when the story had broke in the papers... and they started talking about it at the office... and the day after that, when you started digging into it.
I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking.
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes.
And then I took them off again so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.
I tried to hold myself together, but...
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.
Come along. The big boss wants to see us.
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.
We had him insured and it's gonna cost us dough. That's always wrong.
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no predisposing medical cause of any kind.
Died of a broken neck.
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.
His wife and daughter made the identification.
The train people and some of the passengers told how he went through... to the observation car.
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.
What do the police figure?
That he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train.
They're satisfied.
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.
(Norton) All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I believe the legal position is now clear.
Please stand by.
I may need you later.
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.
You find this an uncomfortably warm day, Mr. Keyes?
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I didn't know this was formal.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Any new developments?
I just talked to this Jackson long distance, up in Medford, Oregon.
Who's Jackson?
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.
They were out on the observation platform together, talking.
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and so Jackson went back... to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.
When he returned to the observation platform, no Dietrichson.
Well, Jackson didn't think anything was wrong until... a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara.
They found Dietrichson's body on the tracks near Burbank.
Very interesting about the cigar case.
Anything else?
No, not much.
Dietrichson's secretary says she didn't know anything about the policy.
There's a daughter, but all she remembers is Neff talking to her father... about accident insurance at their house one night.
I couldn't sell him at first.
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.
Later I saw him in the oil fields and closed him.
He signed the application and gave me his check.
A fine piece of salesmanship that was, Mr. Neff.
Well, there's no sense in pushing Neff around.
He's got the best sales record in the office.
Are your salesmen supposed to know a customer is going to fall off the train?
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?
Then what do you think of this case?
This policy might cost us a great deal of money.
As you know, it contains a double indemnity clause.
Just what is your opinion?
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?
One of those interesting little hunches of yours?
Nope. Not even a hunch.
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed a very definite opinion.
I think I know. In fact, I know I know what happened to Dietrichson.
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.
What do you say to that?
Me?
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.
There's a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office...
[intercom buzzing]
Yes? Have her come in, please.
There's a widespread feeling that... just because a man has a large office, he must be an idiot.
I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.
No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this.
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.
I assure you I appreciate it. This is Mr. Keyes.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?
(Norton) May I extend our sympathy in your bereavement?
I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss.
But now that you're here I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business?
You know why we asked you to come, don't you?
No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent.
Your husband had an accident policy with this company.
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.
No. I remember some talk at the house, but he didn't seem to want it.
Your husband took the policy out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.
You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects.
His safe-deposit box hasn't been opened yet.
It seems a tax examiner has to be present.
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think... you're being subjected to any questioning... but there are a few things we should like to know.
What sort of things?
We have the report of the coroner's inquest.
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.
In fact, we are not satisfied at all.
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect... a suicide.
I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water? Please.
Thank you.
Had your husband been depressed or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?
Did he have financial worries, for instance?
He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries.
Let us examine this so-called accident.
First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. Why?
Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do.
Do what? Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform.
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason.
Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there.
What was his name, Keyes? His name was Jackson. Probably still is.
So he gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars.
And then he is alone. And then he does it. Does what?
He jumps. Suicide. In which case, the company is not liable.
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.
Just a moment, please. I said we could go to court. I didn't say we want to.
What I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides.
A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value.
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in here, I had no idea you owed me any money.
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.
Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is.
You want to bargain with me, at a time like this.
I don't like your insinuations about my husband, and I don't like your methods.
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.
[Door slamming]
(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.
Only you fumbled on the goal line.
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.
Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on.
I haven't, eh? She can go to court and we can prove it was suicide.
Oh, can we?
Mr. Norton, the first thing that struck me was that suicide angle.
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper basket just three seconds later.
You know, you ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime.
You might learn a little something about the insurance business.
Mr. Keyes, I was raised in the insurance business.
Yeah, in the front office.
Come now, you've never read an actuarial table in your life, have you?
Why, they've got 10 volumes on suicide alone.
Suicide by race, by color, by occupation... by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day.
Suicide, how committed? By poisons, by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.
Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison... such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic... alkaloid, protein, and so forth.
Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places... under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks... under the feet of horses, from steamboats. But, Mr. Norton... of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap... from the rear end of a moving train.
And do you know how fast that train was going... at the point where the body was found? 15 miles an hour.
Now how can anybody jump off a slow moving train like that... with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself?
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay through the nose, and you know it.
May I have this?
Come on, Walter.
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.
(Walter) I could have hugged you right then and there, Keyes...
you and your statistics.
You were the only one we were really scared of...
and instead you were almost playing on our team.
That evening when I got home, my nerves had eased off.
I could feel the ground under my feet again.
And it looked like easy going from there on in.
That $100,000 looked as safe for Phyllis and me...
as if we had the check already deposited in the bank.
[Phone ringing]
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.
You were wonderful in Norton's office.
I felt so funny, I wanted to look at you all the time.
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.
Don't let anybody see you.
[Doorbell ringing]
Hello, Keyes.
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?
Talking about Dietrichson. He had accident insurance, didn't he?
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?
Walter, I had dinner two hours ago and it stuck half way.
That little man of yours is acting up again, huh?
There's something wrong with the Dietrichson case.
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.
Maybe he just didn't know that he was insured.
No. No, that couldn't be it.
You delivered the policy to him personally, didn't you?
Yeah.
You got his check?
Sure I did.
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.
Walter, I've been living with this little man for 26 years.
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.
No. Not suicide.
But not an accident, either.
What else?
Now look, Walter.
A guy takes out an accident policy that's worth $100,000... if he's killed on a train.
Then two weeks later, he is killed on a train.
And not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car.
Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is?
One out of I don't know how many billions.
And add to that the broken leg. No, it just can't be the way it looks.
Something has been worked on us. Such as what?
Murder?
Don't you have any peppermint or something?
Sorry. Want a little soda water? No, no, no.
Who do you suspect?
(Keyes) Maybe I like to make things easy for myself.
But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary.
You mean the wife?
Yeah.
That wide-eyed dame that just didn't know anything about anything.
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.
I know she wasn't, Walter.
I don't claim to know how it was worked, or who worked it... but all I know is that it was worked.
I've got to get to a drugstore.
This thing feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.
See you at the office in the morning. Yeah.
I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight.
If it wasn't for Norton and his striped-pants ideas about company policy...
I'd have the police after her so fast it'd make her head spin.
They'd put her through the wringer... and, brother, the things they would squeeze out.
Only you haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience... all the percentage there is, and this hunk of concrete in my stomach.
Can I have one of those things?
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.
[Elevator door shuts]
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.
It's those stinking hunches of his.
And he can't prove anything, can he?
Not if we're careful. Not if we don't see each other for a while.
How long a while?
Until this dies down.
You don't know Keyes.
Once he gets his teeth into something, he never lets go.
He'll investigate you, have you shadowed.
He'll watch you every minute from now on.
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us. We're not the same anymore.
We did it so we could be together, but instead of that it's pulling us apart.
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?
And you don't really care whether we see each other or not.
Shut up, baby.
(operator) Pacific All
Risk. Good afternoon.
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Hello.
Lola Dietrichson.
Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Could I talk with you just a few minutes?
Somewhere where we could be alone?
Oh, yes. Come into my office.
Is it something about what happened?
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.
Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes?
No. It's all yours, Walter.
Look at me, Mr. Neff.
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical. I'm not even crying.
But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong... and I had that same feeling once before, when my mother died.
When your mother died?
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.
We had a cabin there.
It was winter and very cold. My mother was very sick with pneumonia.
She had a nurse with her.
There were just the three of us in the cabin.
One night I got up and went into my mother's room.
She was delirious with fever.
All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open.
The nurse wasn't in the room.
I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could.
Just then I heard a door open behind me.
The nurse stood there.
She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes...
I'll never forget.
Two days later, my mother was dead.
Do you know who that nurse was?
No. Who?
Phyllis.
I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then.
He wouldn't listen to me. Six months later she married him... and I kind of talked myself out of the idea she could have done anything like that.
But now it's all back again, now that something's happened to my father, too.
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.
Yes, and two days before he fell off that train, what was Phyllis doing?
She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on... pinning a black veil to it.
As if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.
Aren't you just imagining these things?
I caught her eyes in the mirror.
They had that look in them they had before my mother died.
That same look.
You don't like your stepmother, do you?
Isn't it just because she is your stepmother?
I loathe her because she did it. She did it for the money.
Only you're not going to pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?
She's not going to get away with it this time, because I'm going to speak up.
I'm going to tell everything I know.
You'd better be careful, saying things like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.
[Sobbing]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to act like this.
All this that you've been telling me, who else have you told?
No one.
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.
I've moved out.
I'm not living at home anymore.
And you haven't told that boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.
Where are you living now?
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.
Four walls, and you just sit and look at them?
Yes, Mr. Neff.
(Walter) So that evening
I took her to dinner...
at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.
I wanted to cheer her up.
The next day was Sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach.
She had loosened up a bit, she was even laughing.
I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.
It was dynamite, whether it was true or not.
And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.
You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.
I couldn't even phone her because I was afraid you had the wires tapped.
Monday morning there was a note on my desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.
For a minute I wondered if it could be about Lola.
It was worse.
Outside your door was the last guy in the world I wanted to see.
Come in. Come in, Walter.
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.
After all the years we've known each other... do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement?
About what?
About me.
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?
This Dietrichson business, it's murder... and murders don't come any neater.
As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into... smart, tricky, almost perfect, but...
I think Papa has it all figured out.
Figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?
That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.
Now look, Walter. You can't be sure of killing a man... by throwing him off a train that's going 15 miles an hour.
The only way you can be sure is to kill him first... and then throw his body on the tracks.
Now that would mean either killing him on the train... or, and this is where it really gets fancy, you kill him somewhere else... and put him on the tracks.
Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.
Well, look, Walter, it was like this.
They killed the guy, the wife and a somebody else... and the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson... then the somebody else jumped off... then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed.
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.
Because it was night, very few people were about... they have the crutches to stare at... they never really looked at the man at all.
Fancy all right, Keyes, but maybe it's a little too fancy.
Is it? I tell you, it all fits together like a watch.
Now let's see what we have in the way of proof.
The only guy who really got a good look at this supposed Dietrichson... is sitting right outside my office.
I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon.
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.
These are fine cigars you smoke.
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.
Well, did you study those photographs?
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
Up in Medford we take our time making up our mind.
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.
Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson?
Yes.
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?
I mean, this is not the man that was on the train.
Will you swear to that?
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.
If I say it, I mean it. If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.
This is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.
Just how would you describe the man you saw on the observation platform?
Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man... about 10 or 15 years younger than the man in these photographs.
Dietrichson was about 50, wasn't he, Walter?
Fifty-one, according to the policy.
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.
Of course, it was pretty dark out on that platform.
Come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me.
But I'm positive just the same. Thank you, Jackson.
Of course, you understand this matter is strictly confidential?
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.
Any time you need me, I'm entirely at your disposal, gentlemen.
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.
Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson down to you with an expense account.
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with... the Dietrichson claim.
Well, take care of his hotel bill, will you?
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?
Yeah. He'll be right down.
No. Never been up there.
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.
There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis. No relation.
Let me see. This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis.
A very reputable man, too, I'm told. All right, Mr. Jackson.
Suppose you go down to the cashier's office.
Room 27 on the 11th floor.
He'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight.
Tonight?
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?
Well, just don't put her on the expense account.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.
There it is, Walter. It's beginning to come apart at the seams already.
Murder's never perfect. Always comes apart sooner or later.
And when two people are involved, it's usually sooner.
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and a somebody else.
Pretty soon we'll know who that somebody else is.
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.
Their emotions are all kicked up.
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.
They may think it's twice as safe because there are two of them.
But it isn't twice as safe.
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder... and it's not like taking a trolley ride together... where they can get off at different stops.
They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride... all the way to the end of the line.
And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.
She put in her claim.
I'm gonna throw it right back at her.
Let her sue us if she dares.
I'll be ready for her and that somebody else.
They'll be digging their own graves.
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.
Keyes is rejecting your claim.
He's sitting back with his mouth watering, waiting for you to sue.
He wants you to sue, but you're not going to.
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.
He's figured out how it was worked.
He knows it was somebody else on the train... and he's dug up a witness he thinks can prove it.
Prove it how? If he rejects that claim, I have to sue.
Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot of other things are going to come up.
Like, for instance, about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.
What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?
The way she died.
And about that black hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat.
Lola's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories.
She's been seeing you. I've been seeing her, if you want to know.
So she won't yell her head off about what she knows.
She's putting on an act for you, crying all over your shoulder, the lying...
Keep her out of this. All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue.
Because you don't want the money anymore... even if you could have it, because she's... made you feel like a heel all of a sudden?
It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.
It's because of Lola, what you did to her father.
You're afraid she might find out someday and you can't take it, can you?
I said, leave her out of this.
It's me I'm talking about.
I don't want to be left out of it. Stop saying that.
It's just that it hasn't worked as we wanted.
We can't go through with it, that's all. We have gone through with it.
The tough part is all behind us.
We just have to hold on now and not go soft inside... stick close together the way we started out.
Watch it.
I loved you, Walter, and I hated him.
But I wasn't going to do anything about it, not until I met you.
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.
And I'm the one that fixed it so he was dead.
Is that what you're telling me? And nobody's pulling out.
We went into this together, we're coming out at the end together.
It's straight down the line for both of us, remember?
(Walter)
Yes, I remembered.
Just like I remembered what you had told me, Keyes...
about that trolley car ride...
and how there was no getting off till the end of the line...
...where the cemetery was.
And then I got to thinking what cemeteries are for.
They're to put dead people in.
I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way.
Dead, I mean.
And how it would be if she were dead.
I saw Lola three or four times that week.
One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.
I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that...
I could relax and let go a little.
Why are you crying?
Not gonna tell me, huh?
Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?
They killed my father together. He and Phyllis.
He helped her do it.
I know he did.
What makes you say that?
I've been following him. He's been to her house, night after night.
It was Phyllis and him all along.
Maybe he was just going with me as a blind. And the night of the murder...
You promised me you weren't gonna talk like this anymore.
He was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at UCLA.
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.
Sick!
[Sobbing]
He couldn't show up, because the train was leaving with my father on it.
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.
Sure, it's all in your mind.
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.
(Walter) Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.
What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.
I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere.
But the real braintwister came the next day.
You sprang it on me, Keyes, after office hours, when you caught me...
down in the lobby of the building.
Walter. Walter, just a minute.
Hello, Keyes. Just hang on to your hat, Walter.
What for?
Oh, nothing much.
That Dietrichson case just busted wide open.
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.
The somebody else?
No kidding? Yeah. She just filed suit against us.
It's okay by me.
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.
With two olives.
No, I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date.
Margie. I still bet she drinks from the bottle.
They give you matches when you buy cigars, you know.
All you have to do is ask for them.
Don't like them, they always explode in my pocket. So long, Walter.
(Walter)
I was scared stiff, Keyes.
Maybe you were playing cat-and-mouse with me.
Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.
I had to find out, and I knew where to look. In your office.
(Keyes on dictation machine)
Memo to Mr. Norton.
Confidential.
Dietrichson file.
With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...
I disagree absolutely.
I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime...
and he's definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.
In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...
and I personally vouch for him without reservation.
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing stops]
Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established...
between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...
whereas I am now able to report that such a connection has been established...
between her and another man.
This man has been observed to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...
on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.
We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti...
former medical student, age of 28...
residing at
Lilac Court Apartments...
12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.
We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime...
and have found that they cannot be accounted for.
I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration.
It is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti...
and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action.
I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office...
of the district attorney.
Respectfully, Barton Keyes.
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing stops]
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.
Yes, it has to be tonight.
How's 11:00?
Don't worry about Keyes.
Just leave the front door unlocked and put the lights out.
No, nobody's watching the house. Not anymore.
It's just for the neighbors. I told you not to worry about Keyes.
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.
Goodbye, baby.
(Walter) I guess I don't have to tell you...
what I intended to do at 11:00, Keyes.
For the first time, I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in...
and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
What I didn't know was that she had plans of her own.
[Car approaching]
[Car door closing]
In here, Walter.
[Jazz music playing]
Hello, baby.
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?
What's that music?
A radio up the street.
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?
We were talking about automobile insurance.
Only you were thinking about murder.
I was thinking about that anklet.
And what are you thinking about now?
I'm all through thinking, baby.
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Where are you going? You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.
All right, I'll tell you. A friend of mine's got a funny theory.
He says when two people commit a murder, it's sort of like they're riding... on a trolley car together. One can't get off without the other.
They're stuck with each other and they have to go on... riding together clear to the end of the line.
And the last stop is the cemetery.
Maybe he's got something there. You bet he has.
Two people are gonna ride to the end of the line, all right.
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.
Just who are you talking about? An acquaintance of yours.
A Mr. Zachetti.
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing... because I happen to know a little something about insurance, didn't I?
I was a sucker.
I'd have been brushed off just as soon as you got your hands on the money.
Nobody wanted to brush you off. Save it. I'm telling this.
It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?
That's not true.
Doesn't make any difference if it's true or not.
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti is the one he's been looking for.
He'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what's happened to him.
What's happening to me all this time? Don't be silly, baby.
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?
That's what Keyes thinks.
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.
Maybe I'd rather talk.
Sometimes people are where they can't talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.
And if it was you, they'd charge that up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?
Sure they would, and that's just what's gonna happen, baby.
'Cause he's coming here tonight, in about 15 minutes.
With the cops right behind him. It's all taken care of.
That would make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?
Right. And it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial... and Lola gets a chance to sound off... before they trip you up on the stand, and you start to go in drag me down with you.
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up... so we can get the money and be together.
That's cute. Say it again. He came here first to ask where Lola was.
I made him come back.
I was working on him.
He's a crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.
I kept hammering into him that she was with another man... so he'd go into one of his jealous rages, and then I'd tell him where she was.
And you know what he would've done to her, don't you, Walter?
Yeah, and for once I believe you, because it's just rotten enough.
We're both rotten.
Only you're a little more rotten.
You got me to take care of your husband for you... and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.
Then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you.
That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.
Is what you've got cooked up for tonight any better?
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?
[Gun fires]
You can do better than that, can't you, baby?
Better try it again.
Maybe if I came a little closer?
How's this?
Think you can do it now?
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?
Don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time.
No, I never loved you, Walter, not you or anybody else.
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.
That's all you ever meant to me... until a minute ago... when I couldn't fire that second shot.
I never thought that could happen to me.
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.
Just hold me close.
Goodbye, baby.
[Gun fires twice]
Zachetti.
Come here.
I said, come here.
My name is Neff. Yeah, and I still don't like it.
What do you want?
Look, kid.
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.
What's the gag? Suppose you go on back down the hill... to the drugstore and make a phone call.
Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice-cream cone.
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.
She isn't worth a nickel.
If I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.
Tough, aren't you?
Here, take the nickel and call her. She wants you to.
She doesn't want any part of me.
I know who told you that.
It's not true.
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.
Go on. That way.
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.
It's cold.
I wonder if she's still lying alone up there in that house... or if they've found her by now.
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.
[Coughing]
Except I want you to do a favor for me, Keyes.
I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.
And I want you to take care of her and that guy Zachetti... so he doesn't get pushed around too much.
Hello, Keyes.
Up pretty early, aren't you?
I always wondered what time you got down to the office.
Or did that little man of yours pull you out of bed?
The janitor did.
Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be surprised.
I wanted to straighten you out on that Dietrichson case.
So I gather.
How long have you been standing there? Long enough.
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it.
One you didn't quite figure out.
You can't figure them all,
Walter.
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.
Now I suppose
I get the big speech... the one with all the two-dollar words in it.
Let's have it, Keyes.
Walter, you're all washed up.
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.
I'm gonna call for a doctor.
What for?
So they can patch me up?
So they can nurse me along till I get back on my feet?
So I can walk into that gas chamber up at San Quentin on my own power?
Is that it, Keyes?
Something like that.
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?
Look, Keyes.
Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders... till tomorrow morning, when the office opens...
After that you can play it any way you like.
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?
Give me one good reason. I need four hours to get where I'm going.
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.
Good enough to try for.
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.
Just watch me.
You'll never even make the elevator.
So long, Keyes.
[Phone dialing]
Hello... send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.
Yeah. It's a police job.
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.
Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.
They're on the way.
You know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes?
I'll tell you.
Because the guy you were looking for was too close.
He was right across the desk from you.
Closer than that, Walter.
[Panting]
I love you, too.
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la
Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world: the record of the trial of
Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan... not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country... and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village,
I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen...I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you...in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over...
I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from God?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with this trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So! What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily... we will have to be clever...
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
I will dictate a letter.
I have great sympathy for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him for you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest.
Have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God... you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you recite the
Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
By a great victory!
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven?
So you are certain of being saved?
Be careful, it's a dangerous answer.
Since you are sure of your salvation... you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God grant it to me!
Father... permit me to attend Mass.
Joan, if we permit you to attend Mass... will you stop wearing men's clothes?
So, you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass?
These shameless clothes... abominable to God...
You are no daughter of God...
You are Satan's creature!
Go prepare the torture chamber.
She really looks like a daughter of God, eh?
The torture chamber.
Regard your judges.
Do you not feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you?
But God is even wiser!
Listen, Joan, we know that your visions do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel?
You have knelt before Satan, not St. Michael!
Don't you see that it's the Devil who has turned your head... who has tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to abjure!
The Church opens its arms to you... but if you reject it, the Church will abandon you... and you will be alone... alone!
Yes, alone... alone, with God!
Even if you part my soul from my body...
I will confess nothing...
And if I do confess, later I will say it was forced from me!
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She has a fever... we must bleed her.
Be careful, she could end her own life... she's very crafty.
Bring the Sacraments.
Is there something you wish to tell us?
I fear that I am about to die... and if I do, I ask you to bury me in sacred ground.
The Church is merciful...
It always welcomes the misguided lamb.
Joan, we all want what's best for you.
Look, I have sent for the Sacraments.
I am a good Christian.
Do you not know it is the
Body of Christ you refuse?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy?
I love and honor God... with all my heart.
You claim...that I am... sent by the devil.
It's not true... to make me suffer, the devil has sent you... and you... and you... and you...
There is nothing left to be done... alert the executioner!
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul...
It is to you, Joan, that I speak.
It is to you that I say your King is a heretic!
My King is the most noble
Christian of all.
The arrogance of this woman is insane.
France has never seen such a monster...
I have never wronged anyone.
If you do not sign, you will be burned alive...
The stake awaits you...
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.
Joan, sign... and save your life!
Joan, we have great sympathy for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the name of the Lord. Amen.
Having recognized your errors, you shall not be excommunicated.
But as you have greatly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment, to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of anguish.
A good day's work: you have saved your life and your soul.
She has only made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Go find the judges!
I take it back, I have lied...
Hurry!
I have committed a great sin...
I have denied God... to save my life.
But Joan, you have confessed before everyone that the devil misled you.
You still believe you were sent by God?
Her answer will bring her death.
Everything I said was for fear of the stake.
Have you anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Now...already?
How am I to die?
At the stake.
I'll bring the last Sacrament.
How can you still believe that you are sent by God?
His ways are not our ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
...my martyrdom!
...and your deliverance?
...death!
Will you take confession?
May the Body of Our Lord
Jesus Christ keep my soul... unto life everlasting. Amen.
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour approaches.
Dear God, I accept my death gladly... but do not let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The flames sheltered
Joan's soul... as it rose to heaven -
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France...
Joan, whose memory will always be cherished... by the people of France.

Good morning my friends.
This record comes to you through the Sales Talk Transcription Co. Inc.
Your speaker, the mechanical salesman.
May I introduce
Mr. J. Willecomb Bellows,
inventor of the Bellows
Feeding Machine,
a practical device which automatically feeds your men at work.
Don't stop for lunch.
Be ahead of your competitor.
The Bellows feeding machine will eliminate the lunch hour,
increase your production and decrease your overhead.
Allow us to point out some of the features of this wonderful machine.
Its beautiful aerodynamic streamlined body,
its smoothness of action made silent by electroporous metal ball bearings.
Let us acquaint you with our automaton soup plate,
its compressed air blower, no breath necessary,
no energy required to cool the soup.
Notice the revolving plate with the automatic food pusher.
Observe our countershaft double-knee action cornfeeder,
with its synchromesh transmission,
enabling you to shift gears by the mere tip of the tongue.
Then there is the hydrocompressed sterilized mouth wiper.
Its factors of control insure against spots on the shirt front.
These are but a few of the delightful features
of the Bellows Feeding Machine.
Let us demonstrate with a worker.
Actions speak louder than words.
Remember, to keep ahead of your competitor,
you cannot ignore the importance of the Bellows Feeding Machine.

Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill
Subtitling: TVS - TITRA FILM
They're going mad, sir.
It's the students.
All right. Let them in.
- Swine!
- Beasts!
- Into the valley of death...
- Into the jaws of hell...
..rode the 600!
Hey, hey. Ease up.
You're sitting on my cloak.
- Something up down below?
- Not a sausage.
- Ah. Here you are, Terry.
- Thank you.
I can't see him anywhere.
- Programs.
- Oh. Two, please.
One here. Thanks, pal.
Quite a turnout down below.
Old Palmer's music had better be good.
Boronskaja wouldn't dance the leading role if it wasn't.
- Boro who?
- Who exactly is Boronskaja?
Since you've stood in a queue for six hours waiting to see her dance...
Not to see anybody. To hear.
Have you ever heard of Professor Palmer?
- Never.
- You will.
The program says, "Heart Of Fire, music by Andrew Palmer."
- Our professor.
- Boro-what's-her-name best be good.
She's hardly likely to be anything else.
There he is. Palmer!
Livy!
Come on, Livy!
We know him.
Do you remember my Cytherean Rhapsody?
- Forget it.
- That's it. Your rhapsody.
- It must be an accident.
- Did you show him?
- I show him all my work.
- You think he lifted it?
Shh!
She's a great patron of the arts.
Vicky. Vicky.
Vicky.
Lermontov's coming.
- I say! That's yours, too, isn't it?
- Yes.
Steady, old boy.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Shh!
Please, do you mind?
Oh, really!
Dear Professor, we're very proud of you. I hope you're proud of yourself.
You're too kind. Monsieur Lermontov.
- We meet the great man at last.
- Enchanté, madame.
I never imagined I'd succeed in getting you here.
I must be a very clever woman.
If some fat harridan is going to sing, I must go.
- I can't bear amateurs.
- Neither can Lady Neston.
- What do you mean?
- She has a niece who dances.
Professionally.
Hello, Professor.
Now, please don't get up,
Mr Lermontov.
Now, are you prepared for a surprise?
Do you mean a surprise or a shock?
Well, to take the plunge,
I've asked my niece to dance tonight.
What would you call that?
A shock.
Oh, well, you're certainly very candid.
You know, Mr Lermontov,
I wouldn't dream of boring you with the performance of an amateur.
My niece has been dancing leading roles for some time now.
The critics think highly of her work.
How would you define ballet,
Lady Neston?
Well...one might call it the poetry of motion, perhaps, or...
One might. But for me, it is a great deal more.
For me, it is a religion.
And one doesn't really care to see one's religion practised in an atmosphere such as this.
I hope you understand.
Attractive brute.
- I'll have a champagne cocktail.
- Yes, sir.
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.
Do you know at parties everybody is supposed to be very happy?
But perhaps you dislike them as much as I do.
Still, I think it might have been worse.
- Do you?
- It very nearly was much worse.
- Oh?
- Thank you.
We were to be treated to a little dancing exhibition.
But now we're to be spared that horror.
Mr Lermontov, I am that horror.
Mmm...
It's a bit late for apologies.
Yes, a little late, I think.
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
But you're not sorry
I didn't dance, are you?
- May I ask why?
- Because, my dear Miss...
Victoria Page.
Miss Page, if I accept an invitation to a party,
I do not expect to find myself at an audition.
Yes. You're quite right.
Why do you want to dance?
Why do you want to live?
Well, I don't know exactly why, but, uh...I must.
That's my answer, too.
Come with me.
- Where to?
- We're going to talk.
- But I don't want to talk to you.
- Don't worry. I'll do the talking.
Can I see
Mr Lermontov now, please?
What is it, Dimitri?
A young man called Craster.
He's been here a hundred times.
I've told him you're asleep.
He will not believe me.
Either you're a bad liar or he's a man of good sense.
Show him in and serve breakfast.
Mr Craster.
What can I do for you, Mr Craster?
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr Lermontov, but it's a matter of great importance to me.
Yes?
I wrote you a letter, a silly letter.
I'd like to have it back before you read it.
I see.
That's the one.
Unfortunately, Mr Craster,
I have already read this letter.
Oh.
- Mr Lermontov, please.
- You are Professor Palmer's pupil?.
You say you've written a string quartet and a piano concerto.
Yes.
Very interesting.
Would you care to play me something?
Something of your own, I mean.
Of course, if...if you wish it.
This is a study
I wrote for the piano.
But I'm thinking of orchestrating it and putting it into an opera
I'm working on.
But are you finished already?
It was very interesting.
Hope I haven't ruined your breakfast.
By the way...
I need a new coach for the orchestra.
Would the idea interest you?
Would it...interest?
I shouldn't be able to pay much.
£8 a week and expenses.
It would be absolutely marvellous.
Get some breakfast and come over to Covent Garden.
Thank you.
And your letter, Mr Craster.
If you take my advice... you'll destroy it immediately and forget about it.
The Heart Of Fire is your work, isn't it?
These things happen unintentionally.
I know. That's why...
That's why it is worth remembering that it is much more disheartening to have to steal than to be stolen from, hmm?
Good morning.
# As I walk the long, cloudy, stormy night... #
# He went to Covent Garden in the morning... #
What a corker.
Course I tried to get her.
Tried to get her twice. Ta-ra.
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you.
Hey, you'll pardon me.
This is the way to the stage, isn't it?
- Name?
- Julian Craster.
- What name?
- Julian Craster.
Not on my list.
- Lunch, Irina?
- Yes.
But I have an appointment...
I'm sorry, but I've got my job to look after.
- Good morning, George.
- Oh, bonjour, madame.
How is Madame George?
Oh, she's la très jalouse.
Very jalouse.
It's that bit of a photograph we had took together. Cold drink?
They been looking all over London for you this morning.
That's what I said.
How much longer must I wait?
- I'll send for the SM.
- What is your name?
Julian Craster.
I have an appointment with Mr Lermontov.
Julian Kwis...Kweiss...
- Craster.
- Kwaster.
Well, George, if this young man is invited by Mr Lermontov, you can pass him, yes?
Ça va by me, madame. Ça va by me.
Follow me, young man.
- Est-ce que vous...?
- Comment?
Are you a dancer?
Yes...at night.
Not very much in the morning.
I don't know much about the ballet.
- You are artiste?
- Yes. I'm a composer.
Ah! And you wish to see who?
Well, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure.
They are all there. Take your choice.
Excuse me. Who's in charge?
There's five or six of them that thinks they are.
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- Don't ask me.
I'm just somebody's mother.
That doesn't mean much around here,
I can tell you.
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- In charge of what?
- Mr Lermontov asked me to come.
- Why?
- He's engaged me.
- Not as a dancer, I hope.
No.
Allons, mes enfants! Au boulot!
And...
Well, Mr Ratov,
Mr Ljubov wants it moved.
It is on the plan, and there it stays.
Well, if you say so.
- Merci.
- Morning, madame.
Ah, here comes the great
Boronskaja at last.
And today she's only
43 minutes late.
Am I supposed to congratulate myself on that?
I tell you, Irina, my patience is at an end.
I shall go to Lermontov and explain to him how no theatre is big enough to hold both you and me!
I might as well start packing.
Oh, there's no hurry. He might choose to dispense with MY services.
He is quite crazy enough.
But if we go, we go together,
Grischa, darling. Promise?
Coo, Buschka.
- Who are you?
- Victoria Page.
I expect Mr Lermontov has spoken about me.
- He's invited me here...
- No, this is too much.
He invites them, I teach them.
I get rid of them, he forgets them.
And now, unhappy girl, please go to the far corner of the stage, where you'll meet five others to whom Mr Lermontov has also extended his hospitality.
Quiet, please!
I want to rehearse the first act of Heart Of Fire.
Will everybody not concerned leave the stage, please?
Right-o, boys, set act one. Hurry.
Is that so? Well, I agree.
Where are you going, my dear?
I'm going to talk to Mr Lermontov.
Wouldn't it be better to wait until after rehearsal?.
Oh, no. You see,
I know him personally.
Ah, well, that makes all the difference. Of course.
- Ratov...
- Yes, Boris?
Stay where you are. I'll come up.
- Good morning, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Ratov.
We must do something about this piece.
The girls have hardly room to move.
Ljubov was right.
- Aha! Ljubov...
- Ljubov is always right.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
Well, well, well. Then take it away.
Take it away.
Well, you see, my dear,
Mr Lermontov is a very busy man.
Now, why don't you go and wait over there with the others?
Ivan! Are you ready?
Yes, I will.
- Sergei Sergeievitch?
- Yes?
Are you acquainted with the works or person of Julian Craster, composer and conductor?
- No.
- Nor I.
Which proves how sadly we lag behind the times, for here he is in our midst.
Lermontov has engaged him this morning.
Rond de jambe... E.
Class dismissed.
No, gentlemen. Figure 29, sing.
I think that will do.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The brass could do with your attention, Craster. Tomorrow.
Gentlemen, I'm very sorry to bring you here so early.
But I've been in front for this ballet more than once and I really must...
There are one or two things
I really must put right.
So, um, Heart Of Fire.
Overture, please.
From the beginning.
Oh, by the way, trumpets, at two bars before figure two, have you got an E natural?.
No. I've got an E flat.
Ah. Makes all the difference.
Should be E natural.
Right. From the beginning.
I know it's hard to get your lips set this early, but we ought to be able to come in together.
Even more pianissimo. Less strings.
A, oboe.
From the beginning, please.
- That's nice.
- Mr Craster!
What is going on?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Do you realise that by calling the orchestra early we must pay them?
And why are you rehearsing
Heart Of Fire?
Did I ever ask you to do that?
Tell me. I'm interested.
I'm sure Mr Lermontov will be interested, too.
- Well?.
- I like it.
You like it? You must also like the
National Anthem and the Marseillaise.
I hope you won't summon the full orchestra at dawn to practise those noble melodies?
I leave this young man to you,
Lermontov.
After all, he is your discovery, not mine.
Mr Craster, I must ask you to exercise in future a little more control over your natural ambitions.
And why you've chosen Heart Of Fire for this early-morning escapade...
Good morning, gentlemen...
..is a mystery
I shall never hope to solve.
May I see that wrong note in the score, please?
Hmm. However, there are passages in Heart Of Fire which no one need be ashamed of.
Thank you, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Miss Page.
- Good morning, Edmund.
- Is Lord Oldham with you?
- Yes, miss.
Be careful, miss.
- Good morning, Peter.
- Hello, Vicky.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?
Having lunch with Boris Lermontov, the fellow who runs the ballet.
- Oh. Business or pleasure?
- A bit of both.
Are you shopping or slumming?
Don't worry, Grischa.
I'll bring her back at three o'clock.
- How are you, madame?
- How are you?
Hello, Peter.
I hope we haven't kept you waiting.
No, not at all.
- Boris, meet my friend Vicky Page.
- How do you do?
Can we give you a lift anywhere?
- No, thank you, Peter.
- Excuse me, Miss Page.
Who? Victoria Page? yes, she may dance.
Good morning, my dear young ladies.
I hope I find you all very well.
There are one or two things
I would like to say.
As you know, the ballet's leaving Saturday for Paris.
I can't imagine anything more enchanting than inviting all of you, but I'm afraid this pleasure must be denied me.
To those whom we must regretfully leave behind,
I'd like to say just this - please don't be discouraged.
The fact that we can't take you doesn't mean that you're bad dancers.
It just means that we haven't got enough room.
Please step out Miss Faye,
Miss Banes,
Miss Hardiman and Miss Laughlin.
Yes.
I thank you four ladies for the hard work you've done this year.
- Mr Ljubov echoes my gratitude.
- Mmmm.
Maybe next year, we shall meet you again. Good morning.
Vicky, he means us!
Listen... Mes amis...
I am fiancée. I get married!
My dear child!
All my love and best wishes for your happiness.
I wish you the greatest happiness with your new partner.
- Merci. Grischa? Where is Grischa?
- I'm here, Irina!
Darling, do you hate me?
I could never hate you, Irina, but how can I ever forgive you?
You will forgive me, that I know.
Don't quarrel with your husband as much as me.
Where is Boris Lermontov?
He has nothing to say to me?
Boris!
He has...no heart, that man.
Entrez!
- Mr Craster, I have a job for you.
- Good!
Do I understand you have not been altogether very happy with us so far?
- Well, I...
- Well, what?
Coaching an orchestra is not exactly a young composer's dream, is it?
I'm afraid the job I have may not be a young composer's dream, either.
Still, I hope you do not consider it entirely unworthy of your talent.
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from a fairy tale by Hans Andersen...
..pair of red shoes.
Oh, I beg your pardon?
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from a fairy tale by Hans Andersen.
It is the story of a girl who is devoured by an ambition to attend a dance in a pair of red shoes.
She gets the shoes, goes to the dance and at first, she's very happy.
At the end of the evening, she gets tired and wants to go home.
But the red shoes... are not tired.
In fact, the red shoes are never tired.
They dance her out into the streets, over the mountains and valleys, through fields and forests, through night and day.
Time rushes by. Love rushes by.
Life rushes by.
But the red shoes...dance on.
What happens in the end?
- In the end, she dies.
- Yes. I remember.
The music is by Felipe Beltran.
He did it for us last year during our South American tour.
You'll find some passages marked with a blue pencil. They are bad.
I would like to see what you can do in the way of a little rewriting.
- Oh.
- You can take your time.
- There's no hurry.
- Thank you.
- On vous attend.
Oui, je viens.
Thank you.
Ah, look at our Boronskaja.
She's in wonderful form tonight.
I'm not interested in Boronskaja's form any more.
Nor with any prima ballerina imbecile enough to get married.
- Oh, come now, Boris.
- She's out. Finished.
You cannot have it both ways.
The dancer who relies upon the doubtful comforts of human love... will never be a great dancer.
Never!
That is all very pure and fine, but you can't alter human nature.
No? I think you can do even better than that.
You can ignore it.
Boris!
Adieu.
Well, Irina, now you'll be able to sleep as long as you like and eat sweets all day and go to parties every night.
And you, now you will be calm.
The class will start on time.
No more shouting. No more hysteria backstage. No more...
No more...Irina.
Oh, Monsieur Lermontov!
Miss Page.
- Are you very tired?
- Yes, thank you.
I mean, I'm not very tired.
Monsieur, je vous présente
Miss Victoria Page.
Monsieur Boudin, le directeur général de l'opéra.
- Monsieur Rideaut.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.
You have already visited Monte Carlo, mademoiselle?
Yes, I was here last season.
- Then you know the Hôtel de Paris.
- Yes, but I believe I'm staying...
Hôtel de Paris.
You'll be very comfortable.
La voiture de Monsieur Lermontov vous attend, Miss Page.
Bon soir, mademoiselle.
Montez, mademoiselle.
You look dressed up for a conference.
Hello. Is there a conference on?
Yes. They're all arguing.
I've been here since seven.
There you are, Miss Page.
Will you come in here, please?
I was just going out, Mr Lermontov, when I got your message.
Miss Page...
I've asked you to come here tonight because we're preparing a new ballet, and I've decided to give you a chance and let you dance the principal part in it.
But there's one thing
I must tell you at once.
My belief in your possibilities is not shared by my colleagues here.
However, it is hardly necessary for me to add that whatever their personal belief, they will all give you their best.
The rest, of course, is up to you.
Well, Miss Page...that's all.
We shall start work early tomorrow morning.
I suggest you forget all about your party and go home to bed.
Yes, I will.
And Miss Page?
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Well, what happened?
- I've got a part in a new ballet.
- New? What ballet?
The Red Shoes!
Now, listen to this. It's impossible.
Well, I couldn't rewrite that bit, could I?
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.
Horrors like that speak for themselves.
In fact, I had some ideas about that.
Where are they, dear fellow?
We need a score!
If you'll allow me.
Well, it's the church scene.
Get rid of this sentimental hymn and take a four-square chorale.
Something like this.
Then I thought all the way through, a church bell coming in.
All this on the strings.
Then as the priest appears, the brass.
Shall I play you
The Dance of the Red Shoes?
Thank you, Mr Craster. Thank you.
I want you to change everything.
I want a new score.
There you are, Mr Lermontov.
And where's the orchestration?
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.
You wanted to work. Go home and work.
I don't want to see you till it's done.
You won't!
Why aren't you in bed?
- Oh, you gave me quite a fright.
- I meant to.
Why aren't you in bed?
I was much too excited to sleep, so here I am.
- Are you? I haven't seen you.
- Thank you.
By the way, you haven't seen me, either.
- Has he sent you to bed, too?
- No.
I'm just working on the score of my new ballet, The Red Shoes.
Is that my ballet, too?
Yes, I suppose it is.
I wonder what it feels like to wake up in the morning and find oneself famous.
You're not likely to know if you stay here talking much longer.
- So, good luck.
- Good luck.
She's putting too much into it.
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?
Mind your own business.
She has the dance with me and the dance at the fair earlier.
And the big stuff coming up.
She can't dance everything full out.
- She ought to know that.
- How do you expect her to know it, if you never danced full out before opening night?
Here are the designs for the costumes, Boris.
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?
I'm so sorry. Something has to be done about the music.
She starts the pirouette early.
- The tempo's wrong. It's too fast.
- It's the right tempo.
Of course. Once more.
- She'll be all right.
- I hope so.
Still unconverted, Sergei?
Well, of course she's a charming girl, but...
I know nothing about her charms.
But they won't wait till the end, they'll applaud in the middle!
- Come now.
- Sergei, I'll take a bet.
Oh, enough. Enough.
Miss Page, we are trying to create something of beauty.
While you wave your arms like a scarecrow and bend your knees like an old cart horse, we are unlikely to succeed.
Well, well...it's a bet.
Come, let me see your sketches.
The girl.
You still think I can do it?
Well, at the moment, you look as if you find it difficult.
But when we open in two weeks,
I hope it'll be supremely simple.
Don't forget, the great impression of simplicity can only be achieved by a great agony of body and spirit.
Voilà.
You don't want to ruin your breathing, do you?
From today, you'll lunch in my office.
Craster.
Will you sit over there, please?
Merci. Mr Craster, the piano.
Do you usually have musical accompaniment to your meals?
No, Miss Page, I do not.
I'm afraid this is your fate for the next two weeks.
Mr Craster is going to play
The Red Shoes music at every lunch, tea and dinner you take until we open.
I see.
Yes. In this way, you should become quite familiar with the music.
Yes, I think I probably shall.
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.
- Mr Craster.
- Certainly.
Bon appétit. à votre service, mademoiselle.
Some composers specialise in lunchtime music, don't they?
- Some.
- You?
In my time.
Do you mind not playing that?
It's the right tempo.
Let's take the ballroom scene.
That's the most digestible part of the score.
The ballroom's been cut.
Cut as a scene, but it's still there in my score.
I wrote this dance for a ballroom.
Anyone who understands anything about music will see a ballroom.
Even Lermontov will see a ballroom.
Even you.
And when you're lifted into the air by your partner, my music will transform you.
Into what?
A flower...swaying in the wind.
A cloud...drifting in the sky.
A white bird...flying.
Tell that to Ratov.
He would love your birds and flowers.
You don't?
- If you were a dancer, you'd know...
- Just a minute.
# Nothing matters but the music #
It's hard enough to get off the ground anyway without being a bird or flower.
Won't you imagine anything on the first night?
Yes, a wall between me and the audience.
My music will pull you through it.
Hee-haw!
Miss Page, I'm not a circus conductor and you're not a horse.
It's too fast.
You would not find it too fast if you'd let the slow passage end before you start your pirouette.
My downbeat marks a pause.
We understand it, don't we, gentlemen?
- You come in on the second beat.
- Impossible!
One, two, tia, tia!
It's quite simple.
You see this baton?
- Yes.
- Well, follow it!
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
Vicky. Vicky!
Dance whatever tempo you like.
I'll follow you.
All right, Ivan?
Time to go down, Craster.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Nervous?
- No.
Do I...?
What the devil have you got to worry about?
It's a fine score.
A magnificent score. I only wish I...
Go on.
- Grischa.
- It's chaos, chaos, chaos!
- Grischa...
- Ah, Boris.
- Mon dieu! The red shoes.
- What?
The red shoes are not there!
- Rideaut.
- Monsieur.
Where are they?
- You haven't hidden them yourself?
- No, no, no!
Yes! Fou! Fou!
Boris, look here.
Elephants.
Clumsy elephants have ruined my decor.
- Calm yourself.
- The door! The door! It won't shut.
- Somebody must hold it.
- But who?
The call boy.
He'll have nothing to do.
- Dimitri.
- Give it to me. Hold the door.
- Best of luck, Miss Page.
- I can't remember my entrance.
You think you can't.
What about this?
That's it. It's all right when I hear the music.
Since you undoubtedly will hear the music, it's undoubtedly going to be all right.
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.
If I had any doubts about you, I'd be nervous.
- Am I nervous?
- No.
You're not dancing for an audience.
You're dancing for
Ljubov, Ratov, myself, people you've danced for many times before.
I believed in you from the very beginning.
But now everybody does.
Dance tonight with the same ecstasy
I've seen in you only once before.
At the Mercury Theatre?
Yes, at the Mercury Theatre in London... on a wet Saturday afternoon.
- 40 seconds.
- Coming.
Good luck, my dear.
You're the magician, to have produced this in three weeks from nothing.
A magician can't produce a rabbit from a hat if there isn't already a rabbit in the hat.
It's a pity the theatre only holds 300.
We could have filled the Albert Hall tonight!
But what we're creating tonight, the world will talk of tomorrow.
Good boy.
Rideau.
Ça va? Any swelling?
I mean the head.
All that clapping, bravos, roses...
Puh! All that's nothing.
But when I, who have seen Pavlova dance, tell you that last night you were not bad... not good, but not bad... that's something.
Now I tell you truth.
It was...
- good.
- Thank you, Mr Ljubov.
- My name is Grischa.
- Mine is Vicky.
How do you do?
Arm straighter. So...
Boris Lermontov wants to see you.
Why in the class time? Why?
Silence!
- Fifth.
- Bras.
Hello? Hello? Yes.
Who is it? Oh, it's you!
Monsieur Lermontov...
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for ringing me.
You're not disturbing me at all.
I always have time for congratulations.
- Oh, yes. I agree.
- Monsieur Lermontov...
A most distinguished score.
- Voilà, Monsieur Craster.
- Uh, Monsieur Craster?
Yes.
Of course he'll contact me.
Yes, he's going to.
He's starting with a new ballet, full of gait and charm.
La Belle Meunière, book by Marcel Lucien.
Go away.
Yes. Oh, yes, it's a wonderful role for her.
- Au revoir, Lermontov.
- Au revoir, madame.
No, not this season. Next season.
Merci beaucoup.
Yes. It was very kind of you to ring me.
Thank you very much.
No more calls, not even congratulations.
Au revoir. Where are those papers?
Thank you very much. Here.
Excusez-moi.
Well, Mr Craster, that's all.
I'm proud of you.
- Mr Lermontov, I would like to...
- Some other time...ah, yes!
- Do you read French?
- Yes.
Well, read it.
We'll talk about it some other time.
Mademoiselle Page.
Come in, Miss Page, come in.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you about your future.
When we first met, you asked me a question to which
I gave a stupid answer.
You asked me whether
I wanted to live and I said yes.
Actually, I want more, much more!
I want to create, to make something big out of something little... to make a great dancer out of you.
But first, I must ask you the same question.
What do you want from life?
- To live?
- To dance.
We have two months left of the season in Monte Carlo.
Not much time, but enough, two months.
Then we go on tour - Rome, Vienna,
Copenhagen, Stuttgart, then America.
Then next year, London again.
All the big parts for you...
Coppelia, Lac des Cygnes, Gisèle,
Les Sylphides, La Boutique...
We create them all first with you.
You shall dance... and the world shall follow.
You... Shh!
Not a word.
I will do the talking.
You... will do the dancing.
Ah, Victoria Page.
- Good night, Boris.
- Night, Grischa.
- She was not bad tonight.
- She'll be all right.
All right! Not bad!
But she's a flame!
- Still la-di-da? Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.
Vicky was wonderful in Boutique, just a little Dresden shepherdess.
We should reconstruct the theatre.
- What's wrong with it?
- It's too small!
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.
- Her timing's a miracle.
- Keep her up to it.
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.
- Good night, Mr Lermontov.
- Good night, Vicky.
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.
Uh, thank you,
Monsieur Boudin. That's all.
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.
- Boudin.
- Oui?
Which is the very best restaurant on the coast?
- La Resserre.
- Oui, La Resserre.
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.
Book me a table.
- For...two?
- Yes.
Au revoir.
- Julian.
- Yes?
I never said good night to Lermontov.
Monsieur Dimitri?
No, Miss Page has still not come in.
Monsieur Ratov? Uh, not yet, either.
Monsieur Ljubov? 317... No.
Ah, Monsieur Dimitri, I've just heard they've all gone to supper at the Old Port with Monsieur Ljubov.
His birthday!
Class! Class! Un gateau.
Ah, merci.
Boris Lermontov!
Greetings, Grischa.
Am I permitted to join your party?
Get me a chair!
What a pleasure, Boris.
A chair for Boris Lermontov!
Two chairs for Boris Lermontov!
Make way there. A throne.
A throne for the great Boris.
Take mine.
No, no, take mine.
No, you sit down.
It's your birthday.
Well... seems a long time since I sat down to supper with my entire family.
But it appears that the great
Miss Page is not with us tonight.
Don't you miss another member of our happy little family?
No...no. I can't say I do.
Why should you? You're a busy man.
Have a drink, Lermontov!
Grischa. Ta santé.
Of course we all know you're a busy man, Boris Lermontov, but do you mean to tell me you have noticed nothing?
Don't exaggerate.
Boris, we have a little romance in our midst.
A great romance!
- Romeo Craster.
- And Juliet...Page.
And when... did this great romance begin?
With the Red Shoes.
Charming.
And where have they taken themselves tonight?
What does it matter where they've gone?
They are young, they are together and they are in love.
Darling.
I've decided I do believe in destiny after all.
Do you, my darling? I'm very glad.
Cocher.
Cocher!
You'll wake him.
But I want to know where we are.
Cocher? Co...
One day, when I'm old,
I want some lovely young girl to say to me...
"Tell me, where in your long life,
Mr Craster, were you most happy?"
And I shall say...
"Well, my dear, I never knew the exact place.
"It was somewhere on the Mediterranean.
"I was with Victoria Page."
"What?" she will say.
"Do you mean the famous dancer?"
And I will nod, "Yes, my dear, I do.
"But then, she was quite young, comparatively unspoiled.
"We were, I remember, very much in love."
Did you see that?
She smiled at Craster.
I don't think so.
I suppose you will be sending me to an oculist next.
Watch her dancing.
With pleasure.
Debutantes...at a charity matinée.
Yes. Yes!
Yes. All right. Thursday.
Good evening, Mr Lermontov.
I'm afraid the score's still a bit rough, but I see you had time to look at it.
Yes, Mr Craster.
I have looked at it.
However, it's not about your music that I wish to talk at the moment.
So to come to the point...
What is all this I hear about you and Miss Page?
Oh, I see.
- Could Dimitri...?
- Get out.
Well, Mr Craster?
Yes. We're in love.
I see.
Did you see Miss Page's performance in Lac des Cygnes?
I was conducting.
Did you enjoy it?
It was the loveliest thing
I've ever seen.
It was impossible.
And you know why it was impossible?
Because neither her mind nor her heart were in her work.
She was...dreaming.
And dreaming is a luxury
I've never permitted in my company.
Miss Page wants to be a great dancer.
Perhaps she has spoken to you about her ambitions.
Oh, yes.
She's not, however, a great dancer yet.
Nor is she likely to become one if she allows herself to be sidetracked by idiotic flirtations.
Mr Lermontov, you...don't understand.
We really are in love.
And, Mr Craster, I have had time to look at your latest effort...
Yes?
..and find it equally impossible.
That's not true. It's good.
Childish... vulgar... and completely insignificant.
In that case,
I'll relieve you of it.
There are so many first-class ballet companies to which you may take it with advantage.
Ballet work is not my great ambition.
Some of us think it's rather a second-rate means of expression.
- 'Oui, Monsieur Lermontov?'
- Mr Craster is leaving the company.
Pay him two weeks' salary and get the receipt.
Oh, hello, Boris.
- I was coming to say good night.
- Good night.
- Is anything the matter?
- No, no.
And before I forget, don't do any more work on the new ballet.
- I decided to scrap it.
- Scrap it? What do you mean?
I worked out half the choreography already.
That boy Julian is really gifted.
It's one of our finest scores.
Julian Craster is leaving and
I don't wish to discuss it further.
Oh, you don't? Well, I do!
Do you think I don't know a brilliant score when I hear one?
Do you think I've been working day and night for the pleasure of being told
I am wasting my time?
I tell you, Boris, I've had enough of this lunatic asylum!
I am through with it!
I resign!
I think you've made a very important decision.
Hello, you two. Isn't love wonderful?.
Bonsoir, Julian.
Hello.
Well, what did he say?
Ah. Of course he doesn't really want you to go, Grischa.
He is very sorry.
Well, in that case,
I will think about it.
What about Julian?
I have never seen him quite as bad as this.
He talked a great deal about ingratitude and...disloyalty.
And he said when personal relations start to interfere...
Yes, I know that bit.
My dear children, I'm very sorry.
Boris might feel different in the morning.
The morning? He's leaving for Paris by the 8.15 train.
Has the famous Miss Page come to see me off?
I'd like to talk to you.
I want to know why you quarrelled with Julian.
May I suggest that such matters are hardly your business?
However, since you've gone to all this trouble...
Mr Craster has been unwise enough to interfere with plans of mine.
And that is something
I do not permit.
I thought once that there would be no room in my life for anything but dancing.
You'll think so again, my dear.
But if Julian goes, I shall go, too.
And what do you intend to do?
I shall dance somewhere else.
Oh, yes.
That won't be very difficult with the name I've given you.
Always provided I release you of your contract.
But even if I do, would it be quite the same?
I have never pretended it would.
I could make you one of the greatest dancers the world has ever known.
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.
And all that means nothing to you?
You know exactly what it means to me.
The train is leaving!
Goodbye, Mr Lermontov.
Miss Page is coming!
Julian! Julian!
I'm coming with you!
Hooray!
The fool.
The fool.
No!
Come in. You are late.
I hope you didn't work too hard.
All finished.
I have the injunction with me.
Boris, don't tell me you've changed your mind again.
I...I don't want to stop her doing anything.
She can dance when and where she likes...except the Red Shoes.
- What about the boy?
- That's different.
Everything written under contract to me is mine.
The Red Shoes and his work so far on La Belle Meunière.
I'm not interested in anything else he writes.
If you do The Red Shoes, you'll have to pay him royalties.
Red Shoes is no longer in the repertoire!
Oh.
I understand Patrick Trevellyan is in Paris.
Yes.
I dined with them both last night.
Oh?
- Boronskaja was with him?
- Yes.
Anything I can do?
How's their marriage? Success?
Patrick seems to think so.
Would you like me to arrange a meeting with Irina?
Not arrange.
By chance.
Oh! Boris!
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Irina.
- Good season.
- With the Ballet Lermontov, always.
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.
- Sergei!
- Yes?
- Would you wait a minute, please?
- Yes, of course, Boris.
- Good night, Boris!
- Grischa, please come in and wait.
Oh...a conference.
- Ah!
- Uh!
Letters.
- Nobody writes to me.
- That's not true.
Yours...from Vicky.
From Vicky?
- How is that girl?.
- Read it. You'll see.
And this is from Julian.
It's all about his new opera.
It describes the whole structure.
Enormous talent, that boy.
He says...
"She is an inspiration.
"A miracle."
- Thank you, Mr Boudin. That's all.
- Merci. Bonsoir.
Well...I see it's mail day.
From our two young rebels.
Deserters. I hope they're happy.
- Read, Boris.
- Yes. Read this, too.
It might make you sorry to have lost that young man.
I doubt it.
That reminds me...
Jacques sent me the new score of La Belle Meunière.
I like it.
I'd like you all to hear it at once.
We might open with it in London.
- With Irina?
- We can discuss that.
Lights, all gaiety, fire.
Be good enough to glance through it.
And no prejudice, please.
I hope you say that to yourself sometimes.
Every day. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
On second thought, I think
I would like to read those letters.
My letter was only meant to be read by me.
See you later, Boris.
Good night, Sergei.
I could hardly let him read it.
She calls him a monster... a gifted, cruel monster.
You should have told him that.
I...I am sorry to be late,
Boris Lermontov.
Lady Neston was in front tonight.
She arrived this morning.
She is staying for several weeks.
And Miss Page is joining her next week for a short holiday.
We seem destined to meet at railway stations.
- What are you doing in Cannes?
- Waiting for you. Won't you sit?
But you know, my dear Vicky, how I'm always looking for great dancers.
We all have missed you.
And I was hoping that by now you would have started to miss us... a little.
I have.
You only have to say the words.
- How is everybody?
- Never better.
- How is Grischa?
- Always fighting with Boronskaja.
- And she?
- Always fighting with Grischa.
- Sergei?
- Getting younger.
- And you?
- Getting older.
And you? You are happy?
Yes. Very happy.
As a dancer, I mean.
I haven't danced much, you know.
Oh, I know.
I know every time you have danced.
- But you never stopped working?
- No.
- You never stopped going to class?
- Never.
And why isn't he with you?
His opera's been accepted at Covent Garden.
It's in rehearsal now.
- Would he give it up if you asked?
- I don't know.
- You do.
- I wouldn't ask.
Then why is he asking you?
Does he know what he is asking?
We are preparing a new ballet.
We've been working for weeks.
The costumes and the decor are the most beautiful Ratov has ever done.
Grischa's full of enthusiasm.
Do you know what that means?
Nobody else has ever danced
The Red Shoes since you left.
Nobody else ever shall.
Put on the red shoes, Vicky... and dance for us again.
'This is the BBC Third Program.
'I am at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London.
'Tonight is the first night of Cupid and Psyche,
'a new opera by British composer
Julian Craster,
'whose only well-known work has been the score for The Red Shoes.
'The Red Shoes was a great success
'when produced at Monte Carlo with the Ballet Lermontov,
'but has not yet been seen in this country.
'Oh. Something must have gone wrong.
'I think somebody's going to make an announcement.'
'Ladies and gentlemen,
'I regret to announce that
Mr Julian Craster the composer,
'who was to conduct his own opera, has been suddenly taken ill.
'Sir Hartley Menzies will conduct in his place.'
'Here comes Sir Hartley Menzies now.'
'I'll announce the cast at the interval.'
All the way down from London,
I wondered if I'd find you here.
And here you are.
- So you left your first night?
- Yes.
Oh, Julian.
Why didn't you?
This is all that matters.
All right, love, my sweetheart.
There's a train to Paris at 8.00.
We'll be on it together.
Better hurry and get changed.
- But I'm dancing tonight.
- Walk out.
Good evening, Mr Craster.
Won't they be missing you at Covent Garden?
Leave me alone, both of you!
Please, Julian, wait until after the performance. it'll be too late then.
You're already too late, Mr Craster.
Tell him why you've left him.
- I haven't left him!
- Oh, yes.
Nobody can have two lives - yours is dancing.
Vicky, you can dance anywhere else in the whole world.
Would you be satisfied with less than the best?
If so, you'd never be a great artist.
Would you make her a great dancer as well?.
Never!
Why do you think I've waited so long for a chance to win her back?
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes!
I am...but in a way that you will never understand.
Wait!
Well, Vicky?
I love you, Julian! Nobody but you!
But you love that more.
I don't know! I don't know.
If you go with him now,
I will never take you back. Never!
Vicky, do you want to destroy our love?
Adolescent nonsense!
All right. Go, then. Go with him.
Be a faithful housewife with a crowd of screaming children!
Finish with dancing forever!
Vicky...look at me.
Goodbye, then, my darling.
Julian.
Peut-on commencer l'ouverture?
- Oui. Commencez.
- Bon. Bon. Bon.
Alors, commencez toute de suite.
Vite! Vite!
Vicky...
Vicky. Little Vicky.
There it is, all waiting for you.
The sorrow will pass, believe me.
Life is so unimportant.
And from now onwards, you will dance... like nobody ever before.
Mon petit.
Mon petit! Ah! Monsieur Lermontov!
Mademoiselle Page!
Ladies...and gentlemen!
I'm sorry...to tell you... that Miss Page...is unable... to dance...tonight...
Nor indeed... any other nights.
Nevertheless...we've decided... to present...The Red Shoes!
It...is... the ballet... that made her name... whose name...she made.
We...present it... because...we think... she would have... wished it.
Pas d'espoir.
Julian?
Yes, my darling?
Take off the red shoes.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.
To me...
being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.
Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job...
I knew I wanted to be a part of them.
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies.
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.
They double-parked in front of a hydrant, nobody ever gave them a ticket.
In the summer, when they played cards all night...
nobody ever called the cops.
Tony Stacks. How are you?
Tuddy Cicero.
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?
-How are you?
-Good.
Tuddy.
Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...
and other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss of the neighborhood.
Paulie might have moved slow...
but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.
-It's your fault.
-You started it.
I started it? It's your fault.
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.
My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of 11.
He liked that I got myself a job.
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.
See you, Mikey.
Bye, Henry.
Henry! Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
My mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros...
came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother...
that was the answer to all her prayers.
I was the luckiest kid in the world.
I could go anywhere, I could do anything.
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys...
and let me park their Cadillacs.
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...
and I'm parking Cadillacs.
But it wasn't too long...
before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand.
For your mother and sister.
For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job. But for me...
it was definitely full-time.
That's all I wanted to do.
People like my father could never understand, but I was a part of something.
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
Pissed that he made such lousy money...
pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair.
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me about this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum !
Want to grow up to be a bum?
After a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on at that cabstand.
Every once in a while, I'd have to take a beating. But by then, I didn't care.
The way I saw it...
everybody takes a beating sometime.
-I can't make any more deliveries.
-What? You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.
Come on with me.
-Is that him, kid?
-No.
-How about him?
-No.
-That's the guy.
-Get him.
Excuse me.
-Scumbag.
-Come here, you piece of shit.
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.
From now on, any letter from that school to his house comes directly here.
-Understand?
-Yeah.
Another letter from that school goes to that kid's house... in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.
That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No letters from school.
In fact, no more letters from anybody.
Finally after a few weeks, my mother went to the post office to complain.
How could I go to school after that...
and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?
All right, make the call.
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...
from an outside phone.
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.
There were guys, that's all they did all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.
For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.
If there was a union problem or, say, a beef in the numbers...
only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem.
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said...
and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told.
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie, he got a piece of everything they made.
It was a tribute, like in the old country, except they were doing it in America.
All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.
That's what it's all about. That's what the FBI could never understand.
What Paulie and the Organization does...
is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. That's it.
That's all it is. They're like the police department for wiseguys.
People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody.
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.
The owner knew who I was with...
and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...
I was taken care of first.
Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore...
even though we didn't have a car. At 13...
I was making more money than most of the grown-ups around.
I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.
One day, some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.
You know why?
It was out of respect.
Hi, Mom, what do you think?
-Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
-My God.
You look like a gangster.
They shot me. Help!
Henry, shut the door.
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
I remember feeling bad about the guy...
but I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
You're a real jerk. You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe...
decided to take on a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time...
but he was already a legend.
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give the doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.
The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
The Irishman is here to take all you guineas' money.
-Want a drink?
-Give me a 7 and 7.
-I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
-How you doing?
-Thank you.
-Keep them coming.
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.
He was first locked up at 11...
and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16.
See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.
He actually enjoyed it.
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.
Give me your wallet.
You might know who we are, but we know who you are. Understand?
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...
of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters.
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.
They called him Jimmy the Gent.
Help the lady.
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...
about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.
Okay, see you later.
Henry, come here.
-Say hello to Tommy.
-How're you doing, Henry?
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.
Jimmy, you got anything good?
And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?
How're you doing?
He made them partners.
I'd complain, but who'd listen?
-One Pall Mall.
-There you go.
-What do you need?
-Two Luckies.
-Here you go, Henry.
-Thanks a lot.
What do you need?
-One Pall Mall.
-One Pall Mall, here you go.
-What are you doing?
-It's all right.
-You have permission from your mother?
-How many cartons you need?
-Where'd you get the cigarettes?
-Get him out of here.
-It's okay.
-It's not okay.
-You don't understand.
-You don't understand. Store's closed.
-Henry got pinched.
-Where?
By the factory, selling cigarettes.
Henry Hill. The People of the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.
Docket number 704162.
Yes, sir. That's me.
Just stand there. Now stay there.
Counselor, proceed.
Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
-What for? I got pinched.
-Everyone does, but you did it right.
You told them nothing, and they got nothing.
-I thought you'd be mad.
-I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
-What?
-Look at me.
Never rat on your friends... and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is.
You broke your cherry.
Congratulations!
By the time I grew up, there was $30 billion a year in cargo...
moving through Idlewild Airport...
and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it.
See, you gotta understand, we grew up near the airport.
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place.
They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out.
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...
Paulie had the union people scare them with a strike. It was beautiful.
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.
Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport.
To us, it was better than Citibank.
You got a phone? Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?
There was Jimmy...
and Tommy and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
How're you doing?
Frankie Carbone.
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.
And his guys, Frankie the Wop.
Freddy No Nose.
And then there was Pete the Killer, who was Sally Balls'brother.
Then you had Nickey Eyes...
and Mikey Franzese.
That guy, I wanna see him.
Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice.
I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers.
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.
Suits are coming Thursday.
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.
No, I want them. We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat. How's that?
For us, to live any other way was nuts.
To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...
and took the subway to work every day and worried about bills, were dead.
They were suckers. They had no balls.
If we wanted something, we just took it.
If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never complained again.
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.
Frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?
I can't believe this guy.
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake. It's all there.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.
-No problem, right?
-I'll take care of it.
-Tell him what you were telling me.
-Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.
Tourists and American servicemen change their money... into French money and send it back here.
-Calm down.
-It's beautiful.
It's totally untraceable. Okay?
The only problem is getting a key, but I've got a plan.
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
-Yeah, he's a piece of work.
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
I'm the commandant.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.
-It's beautiful.
-It won't be a problem at all.
-Good.
-We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the middle of the weeds, lying down.
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."
I know I'm resting.
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing.
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.
Now I'm coming around, and who do I see in front of me?
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."
I thought he was gonna shit.
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.
Funny. You're really funny.
What do you mean, I'm funny?
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk? What?
It's just, you know. You're just funny.
You know, the way you tell the story and everything.
Funny how? What's funny about it?
-Tommy, you got it all wrong.
-Anthony.
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?
Funny, how?
Just, you know. You're funny.
Let me understand this.
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?
You know, how you tell a story.
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny.
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.
Motherfucker! I almost had him !
You stuttering prick, you!
Frankie, was he shaking?
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.
He's hanging on my fucking neck like a vulture. What do you want?
This guy didn't want to come and give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab. Of course.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order--
Don't mean to be out of order?
It's good you don't mean to be out of order.
Embarrassing me in front of my friends, like I'm a deadbeat.
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking--
-Don't be like that.
-What do you mean?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.
You're a funny guy.
-That's it, Henry.
-No, go back.
You want to laugh? This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.
I charged him $7,000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam in order to get away from this guy.
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.
They'll find me in the back of a car somewhere in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house, before I get to the car I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.
I'm around you all my life, tell me what I gotta do.
-Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
-What could I do?
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.
-You think it's all right?
-Yeah.
Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
I don't mean no disrespect, but that's the way it is.
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business. Nothing.
All I know is to sit down and order a meal, not how to make a restaurant.
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
I'd love to help you, but what do you want from me? What'll I do?
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help. Help me, please.
You know anything about this restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.
Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool.
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.
Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...
he can call Paulie.
Now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week...
no matter what.
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "
Can I get one of those TVs?
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
When deliveries are made at the front door...
you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount.
You take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.
Then finally, when there's nothing left...
Fucking shame.
...when you can't borrow another buck or buy another case of booze...
you bust the joint out. You light a match.
Do you need help reaching anything?
You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.
You don't know what you're doing.
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.
I've been trying to bang her for a fucking month now.
She won't go out with me alone.
-No.
-No, what?
No, what? Who the fuck asked you anything?
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.
All right, what?
Okay, what.
She don't want to go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What the fuck is this world coming to?
I can't believe this. A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out with me alone unless her girlfriend comes with us.
So you come along, go out with her girlfriend.
See? I knew it.
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth.
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11.:00, and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.
I had business.
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.
-Can we have the check?
-What are you doing?
-I got to go.
-We just got here.
I got that thing. I gotta go.
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.
This way we don't go out like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table.
-Ready?
-Henry, lighten up.
We just got here. What are you doing?
Before it was time to go home, he was pushing me into the car...
then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise...
to meet them again on Friday night.
We agreed.
Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Tommy, what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!
We can talk about this. Take it easy.
Talk about it?
Talk to you after what you just did to me? Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.
What do you expect?
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
Hello, Henry.
-You're ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
-No, wait a minute.
-What?
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen.
Mom.
-I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
-How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.
-My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye, see you later, thanks.
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way, you know what I mean?
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing all right.
Good.
Every time I come here, every time, you two. Don't you work?
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?
Anthony, right in the front.
Anything you need, just let me know.
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
-How are you guys doing?
-How are you?
-You gave them $20 each.
-It's all right.
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.
-Where?
-Over there.
Thanks a lot, Tony.
-What do you do?
-What?
-What do you do?
-I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
the Copacabana is proud to present the king of one-liners...
Henny Youngman.
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
I said, "Where do you wanna go for our anniversary?"
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "
I said, "Try the kitchen. "
Dr. Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him another six months.
I love this crowd.
Air France made me.
We walked out with $420,000 without using a gun.
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.
It's going to be a good summer.
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.
Anybody asks you where you got it, you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?
All right.
Check, sir.
No. You have to sign for it here.
Should I tip him?
-How are you doing?
-Okay. How are you?
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.
Good to meet you.
I'll see you around later.
-Do you know him?
-Yeah.
He lives across the street.
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us champagne. There was nothing like it.
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.
He was an exciting guy.
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.
He knew how to handle it.
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.
Morrie's wigs don't come off!
Even underwater.
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds.
Forget about money. You can afford a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.
Call me now!
Come in for a personalized fitting.
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.
But there's something unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.
I never had to pay the vigorish he demands. Am I something special?
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.
Fuck him !
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?
You got money for that fucking commercial.
You don't got my money?
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.
Pay me my money.
He'll pay.
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
-Jimmy, I'm sorry.
-You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.
Karen, slow down.
Where? Stay there. Don't move.
-What happened?
-It's Karen, Jimmy.
-Money today.
-I'll pay.
What happened?
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together. Clean up.
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?
I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.
Don't shoot.
-Hide this. Are you all right?
-Yeah.
I know there are women, like my best friends...
who would have gotten out the minute their boyfriend...
gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.
I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.
Mazel tov!
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now. He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy.
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.
This is Marie.
Plus, they were all married to girls named Marie.
-She looks Italian.
-She is Italian, you're right.
And they named all their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.
By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.
Paulie, you shouldn't have.
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful. I want to cry.
Here's something to help you get started.
-The bag. The bag.
-What? What bag?
The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money.
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment?
Don't start. Mom, you're the one who wanted us here.
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do? What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out? Daddy never went out at all, Ma ! Keep out of it.
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now? You don't know where he is or who he's with.
He's with his friends! Dad!
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.
He hasn't digested a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you? Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?
What kind of people are they?
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.
But the first time I realized how different...
was when Mickey had a hostess party.
-Karen, where you from?
-Lawrence.
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?
It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven.
Angie, stop picking at that thing.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?
The guy's hands are all over me.
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."
She means it.
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie....
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard, then Vinnie will be there for life.
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it... and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break. She's drunk.
As soon as something happens, you make them out to be saints.
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup. They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...
was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
The woman is no angel, believe me.
They talked about their rotten kids...
and about beating them with broom handles and belts.
And that the kids still didn't pay any attention.
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.
I don't know if I could live like that.
God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?
Karen.
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.
You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. Know why they get caught?
Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen.
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.
After a while, it got to be all normal.
None of it seemed like crime.
It was more like Henry was enterprising...
and that he and the guys made bucks hustling while other guys...
were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts.
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue-collar guys.
The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut corners.
Where's the strong box, you varmint?
Don't fucking move! Don't move.
-See you at the diner.
-I'm riding shotgun.
Did you see him give it right over?
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.
We were all so very close.
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.
Being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal.
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.
Would you read and sign it?
-Anywhere?
-Yeah, anywhere.
This'll take a while, we have to go through everything.
-You boys want some coffee?
-No coffee now, thanks.
-Be careful.
-We'll just go about our business.
There was always a little harassment.
They wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.
They'd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants.
But mostly they just wanted a handout.
A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...
used to curse at them and spit on the floor.
She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.
It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.
We always did everything together, and we always were in the same crowd.
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.
The women played cards.
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy were the first at the hospital.
When we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation...
we went together.
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.
It got to where I was proud that I had the kind of husband...
who was willing to risk his neck just to get us the little extras.
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.
-Can't do it, Karen.
-Why not?
I just can't. I got something lined up.
But tomorrow's the only night she can do it.
-Pretty please?
-I can't. What do you want me to do?
-I got to go.
-Wait a minute.
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?
How much do you need?
-How much?
-That much.
This much. Give me a kiss.
See you later.
All right.
Welcome home, Batts.
Hi, how are you?
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.
There's only one Irishman here.
It's a celebration, fellas.
-Top of the morning to you.
-It's good to be home.
This is my friend Jimmy.
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.
Tommy. All dressed up.
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.
Forgot you were having a party for this mug.
Come here.
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.
Watch the suit.
You little prick. I've known you all my life.
-Don't get too big on me.
-Just don't bust my balls.
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."
This kid was great.
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."
He'd make your shoes look like fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.
No more shines, Billy.
-What?
-I said no more shines.
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
Come on, come on!
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.
Come on, you fucking feel strong?
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.
-You understand what I'm saying?
-It's all right.
We're hugging and kissing over here and then he acts like a fucking jerk.
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.
-I didn't.
-You insulted him a little.
-I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
-Okay.
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.
No, have the drink with me.
The drinks are on the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crew is going to be looking for him.
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
Go open your trunk.
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.
Look who's here.
What did you do? What happened?
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
You, too. How are you?
Why are you up so late?
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep. We're leaving.
-I can't. Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
This stuff is like lead.
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called. Where have you been?
-I been working nights.
-And?
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and hit a deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?
-Okay.
-Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw....
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.
I'll bring the knife back.
-Delicious.
-Thank you.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
I do, almost every night.
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.
Settle down.
How's your friend Henry?
What's the matter? You don't talk much.
Talk. What are you quiet for?
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.
-I'm just listening.
-Something wrong?
When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other.
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"
He says, "What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.
-What does that mean?
-It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
-Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
-No.
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
I like it. One dog goes one way and the other goes the other.
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.
Looks like somebody we know.
Without the beard. It's him.
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
For most of the guys, killings were accepted.
Murder was the only way everybody stayed in line.
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.
Sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked.
Hits became a habit. Guys would get into arguments over nothing.
Before you knew it, one was dead.
They were shooting each other all the time.
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.
Before you touched a made guy, you had to have a good reason.
You had to have a sit-down and you'd better get an okay...
or you'd be the one who got whacked.
Saturday night was for wives...
but Friday night at the Copa was for the girlfriends.
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.
You got to see this show.
What a performer.
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.
It's unbelievable. You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me. But you could see how some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.
So you condone that stuff.
Take it easy.
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.
No, I'm not talking about me.
But, you know, he's got personality.
Personality?
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.
I just said he was talented, you're unbelievable.
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.
He's talented. Leave it at that.
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?
What did you hear about that thing?
-The Brooklyn thing?
-No, the guy from downtown.
-The guy from where Christie lived?
-No.
The guy who disappeared, the one they made the beef on.
-Know the guy I mean?
-Yeah.
His name was Batts. His people are driving everyone crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened to him.
He came into the joint that night and then just disappeared. That was it.
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.
-All right?
-Yeah.
Okay, everybody, let's eat.
I want my money.
He owes it.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
-Paulie was talking about that.
-Got to get it out of there.
They just sold the property to make condominiums.
-It's been six months.
-We got to get it out of there right away.
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
-Here's an arm.
-Very funny, guys.
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?
Oh, that's so bad.
What happened to the car?
I hit a skunk, all right?
Go with your mother.
It's disgusting, Henry.
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from The Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a couple of nights a week.
This is my new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk. This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
-Tommy, will you take him?
-I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
Janice and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work.
I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?
Just try to run. Hang up once more, and you'll deal with me.
Come on, get off of her.
You're an animal.
Spider, on your way over here, bring me a Cutty and water.
-Did you guys eat?
-I'm starving.
-I'll play these.
-You'll play those?
Do I stutter? I play those.
What am I? A mirage?
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.
-You wanted a drink?
-I asked you for one.
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."
-I thought it was Henry.
-You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."
You ain't all right.
No, I thought you said you were all right.
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.
You've been doing this all fucking night to me, you motherfucker!
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.
For everybody else you run.
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!
What's that movie that Bogart made?
-Where he played a cowboy.
-The Oklahoma Kid.
-Shane?
-Oklahoma Kid, that's me!
You fucking varmint. Dance!
Yahoo, you motherfucker!
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
-Henry, what happened?
-You shot him in the foot, Tommy.
He's fucking fine. So he got shot in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?
-Get a towel.
-Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
Don't get me upset, now.
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.
You trying to make me think what the fuck I did here.
It was an accident.
-Little fucking actor.
-I got a great hand here.
-You in or out?
-Yeah, I'm in.
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!
Not without your car keys, you're not.
Are you nuts? What's your problem?
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.
-Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
-No!
I'm telling you, I look in your face and I know that you're lying!
-Get out! Get out!
-Shut up.
Get out of my life!
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!
Spider, what's your rush?
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Spider.
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot is bigger than your fucking head.
Next thing you know, he's gonna be coming in one of these fucking walkers.
Even though you got that, you can dance?
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.
He shoots him in the foot, he tells him to go fuck himself.
Are you gonna let this fucking punk get away with that?
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?
That's what the fucking world is coming to. How do you like that?
-How's that, all right?
-What's the fucking matter with you?
What are you, stupid or what?
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?
I'm fucking kidding with you, you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.
You can't miss at this distance.
You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?
No.
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?
-Hello.
-Hello?
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.
Hello? Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
You keep away from my husband, you hear me?
Hello? Open the door!
Answer me!
I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building... that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!
Is this the superintendent?
Yes, I want you to know, sir, that you have a whore...
living in 2R!
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
Wake up, Henry.
What are you doing?
-Karen, are you crazy?
-I am crazy.
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.
Karen, take it easy.
-Okay?
-Do you love her?
Do you?
-Do you?
-Karen...
I love you. You know I love you.
You don't.
No, you don't.
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was...
that no matter how bad I felt...
I was still very attracted to him.
Why should I give him to someone else?
Why should she win?
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?
You're all I want, Karen.
Please put the gun down, Karen.
Baby, come on.
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?
I got enough to worry about getting whacked on the street!
I got to fucking come home for this?
I should fucking kill you!
How does it feel?
How does it feel, Karen?
I'm sorry!
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?
-Looking good.
-Thank you. Good to see you.
-Hi, Paulie!
-Hi, honey. How are you?
Good.
-Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
-Sure.
-Any of you need anything?
-I'm all right.
-Want anything to drink? A beer?
-No.
-Chinese food?
-No, come on, sit down.
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You gotta straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now. We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you gotta go back.
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.
The two of them come over every day, commiserating.
I can't have it.
I can't do it, Henry.
Nobody says that you can't do what you wanna do.
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family, you understand?
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.
You gotta go home. Smarten up.
-All right?
-All right.
I'm gonna talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her... and it'll be just the way it was when you were first married... your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her, especially to her.
Jimmy and Tommy are going down to Tampa this weekend... to pick up something for me.
Instead, you go with Jimmy.
You come with me, we'll go down.
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.
-We'll have a good time.
-Enjoy yourselves.
And when you come back, you go back to Karen.
Please, there's no other way.
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.
You gonna pay us?
-You gonna pay?
-Give us the fucking money!
I can't, I swear.
Let's go.
-We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
-No!
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!
-Let's throw him over the moat.
-All right.
I'll get the money!
They must really feed each other to the lions down there...
because the guy gave the money right up.
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
Yeah. They mean business.
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.
When we got home, we were all over the newspaper.
At first, I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out that the guy we roughed up...
turned out to have a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.
She gave up everybody.:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.
The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years like he was giving away candy.
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney General's office.
Toast, guys.
Good trip, good life, get out soon.
Good trip, sweetheart.
We'll watch the home front.
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.
Yeah, motherfuck them every chance you get.
I'll call you when I get a chance.
Now take me to jail.
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.
We had a pasta course, and then we had a meat or a fish.
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...
and had this wonderful system for doing the garlic.
He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin...
that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.
It was a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get the smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs: veal, beef, and pork.
Good, but you gotta have the pork.
That's the flavor.
I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce.
Vinnie, don't put too many onions in the sauce.
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.
Put three small onions, that's all I did.
Three onions? How many cans of tomatoes you put in there?
-I put two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.
Johnny Dio did the meat.
We had no broiler, so Johnny did everything in pans.
It used to smell up the joint something awful...
and the hacks used to die, but he still cooked a great steak.
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.
Medium rare. An aristocrat.
You know, when you think of prison you get pictures in your mind...
of all those old movies with rows of guys behind bars.
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.
It really wasn't that bad, excepting that I missed Jimmy...
who was doing his time in Atlanta.
Give me two steaks while you're in there, all right?
Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, mixed together, living like pigs.
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
Good, they deserved it.
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe would never rat on the guys we did.
...had respect. People loved one another.
They left their doors open.
Sorry it took so long.
The skinny guard's getting to be a real pain in the ass.
-We're gonna have to do something.
-I took care of him.
What'd you bring?
-Bread.
-Good.
-Fresh.
-Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.
Come on, what else?
-Scotch.
-Nice.
-Some red wine.
-Okay.
-Now we can eat.
-I got some white, too.
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.
Some more bread.
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.
-You must be kidding.
-Believe me.
What are you doing?
I'll take that.
-All right, I'll catch you guys later.
-Yeah.
You going for a walk in the park?
-Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
-Okay.
-Is there any more?
-No, that's it. Have a good weekend.
-Thanks.
-You too, Henry.
Mrs. Hill, come here.
Come on.
You girls stay right here.
-I want you to hold hands.
-Okay, go right up to the front.
-Let's go.
-How you doing?
-Good, how are you?
-Very well, thank you.
-What you talking about?
-I saw her name in the register.
-Jesus Christ.
-You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Good, let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
-Let her fight these bastards every week!
-Look what you're doing! Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it, Karen?
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money that he owes you.
You know what he told me?
He told me to take my kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
It's gonna be okay.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never seen him. I never see anybody anymore.
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole, he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
-I can't do it.
-Yes, you can. Listen to me.
All I need for you is to keep bringing me the stuff.
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll help me move it.
In a month we're gonna be fine.
-We won't need anybody.
-I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....
Don't worry about him.
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?
We've gotta help each other.
We've just gotta be really careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear a word about her anymore.
Never.
Daddy!
-We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.
With what?
Don't worry with what.
Just start looking for a new house.
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh? You have to go see your parole officer tomorrow.
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.
-Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
-Me!
What do you want?
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
What shit?
-Just stay away from the garbage.
-Look, Paulie--
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.
He's a good earner, but he's wild, takes too many chances.
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.
You gotta watch out for kids like this.
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs, you understand?
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's gonna die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck... who was sneaking behind his back, selling junk.
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?
You know you're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat, you understand that?
You see anybody fucking around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?
That means anybody.
-All right.
-Yeah?
Yeah. Of course.
Took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
But when I did, it was a real score.
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed...
I could see that this was a really good business.
I made $12,000 in my second week.
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.
All I had to do was every once in a while tell Sandy that I loved her.
But it was perfect, I'm telling you.
As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh...
I knew Paulie would never find out.
Within a couple of weeks, it got so big I needed some help.
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
It's fucking great.
Mr. Conway.
-Bring your pay slips?
-Yeah.
Four and a half months of dirt.
-It's so good.
-I did it.
-Do you love it?
-It's wonderful.
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.
The others you couldn't even sit in.
Okay, you ready?
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special. Come on.
Come on. All right.
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
It's nice, huh?
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
I talked to him, and he's looking into everything.
This'll make the Air France haul look like goddamn peanuts.
-Come on.
-He's gonna do it, right?
I told you. He'll check everything out.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been... bleeding for this caper, been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.
Morrie, let's get a drink.
These are the guys that Jimmy put together for what turned out to be...
the biggest heist in American history.: the Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard...
and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used to hang around the lounge and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.
What he was supposed to do was steal the panel truck...
and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up, he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...
for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.
Did you have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?
Come on, they're not that bad.
And it's worth it, isn't it?
Is this the same baby you used last week?
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
She looks just like you.
That's what the stewardess said.
Take it easy, Sandy.
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.
You got all day. Just make it last, all right? Take it easy.
-I got to go.
-Where are you going?
Don't start. You know I gotta go do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.
-Loosen up.
-What are you doing?
-You know, I gotta....
-You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...
at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.
The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million--
Jimmy!
Those sons of bitches!
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
Come here, you! Come here!
Look at this genius. This genius!
Merry Christmas.
-Hello, who's this?
-That's my wife.
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?
Didn't I say what was going on?
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
-The fucking car?
-It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
-I love that car.
-Excuse me, darling, for just a second.
-I just got married.
-Are you nuts?
-What are you getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?
What are you getting excited for?
Because you're going to get us all fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?
-What's the matter with you?
-I apologize.
-I'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say? You being a fucking wise guy with me?
-I'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?
Don't buy anything!
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?
Excuse me.
-What's the matter?
-Take it off.
-Why? What's the matter?
-Take it off!
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big and not to attract attention?
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20,000 mink.
-Bring it fucking back.
-I'll bring it back.
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.
-Get it out of here!
-All right. Let's go, honey.
Shut the fuck up and let's go.
This drink here is better than sex, babe.
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.
He's so jealous. If I even look at anyone else, he'll kill me.
That's great.
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.
I've been looking all over for you.
How are you? Merry Christmas.
Listen, I need the money.
-Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
-Jimmy, I need the money.
I'm relaxing. I need the money.
-I did what I had to do. I need the money.
-Not tonight, Morrie.
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.
-Just not tonight.
-They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.
I got $500,000 coming to me.
The biggest fucking bundle he ever made in his life.
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?
-I'll talk to him.
-It's poison in my eyes.
-Morris, baby, are you all right?
-No, I'm not.
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.
We did it!
-Jimmy.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, who is it?
-It's me.
Pete? One second.
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.
-Do what's right, you understand?
-Yeah.
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!
I got the most expensive tree they had.
-What do you think, Mommy?
-I love them all.
I love the gold outfit.
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.
-What?
-Merry Christmas.
And?
Happy Hanukkah.
-Very funny.
-Go get yourself something nice, okay?
Lufthansa should have been our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.
$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.
Yo, Stacks!
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.
-You didn't bring any coffee?
-What do I look like, a fucking caterer?
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.
Thought you had one of your bitches in here.
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?
Always got these hot books around, or a bitch, or something.
What time is it?
-It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
-I'll be ready in a minute.
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?
Stacks was always crazy.
Instead of getting rid of the truck as he was supposed to, he got stoned...
went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck.
It was all over the television.
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I gotta talk to you.
-Have a drink.
-Have a drink. Come on.
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.
I still gotta talk to you.
What?
-What happened with Stacks?
-Don't worry about that.
-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they gonna go?
-It's in the papers.
-He's worried.
What are you worried about?
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.
-What are you worried about?
-You worry too much.
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.
-Didn't you tell him?
-I didn't tell him yet.
-What?
-Guess what?
They're gonna make him.
Paulie's going to make you?
Tommy.
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.
Motherfuckers, we got them now.
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him ! I want my money.
I want my money! I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.
-Fuck him ! I want my money!
-Good. Go tell him.
You're gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?
Everything's going to be fine.
Henry.
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.
I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie? Him?
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens. That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.
Nobody fucking cares what he says, he talks so much.
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
-Okay?
-All right.
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
Stop breaking my balls, all right?
I was just stalling for time.
I knew I still had till 8.:00 or 9.:00 to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.
I don't want to fucking turn around.
I don't want to turn around. He picks up his fucking head, he says....
I said, "Don't say it."
"Jerkoff! "
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.
I got him and I'm banging his head, banging his fucking face.
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.
It was a load off my mind.
Poor bastard.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I told him, he would have never believed me.
-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
-You're a pisser. A real pisser.
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.
I've never met a ball buster like you, my whole life.
Who loves you more than I do?
-I'd do anything for you.
-Except to stop busting my balls.
-Let's go have coffee.
-Want to go to the diner?
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.
-They got Danishes?
-They got everything.
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.
Hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio--
I thought he'd never shut up.
What a pain in the ass.
-What'll we do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you're through.
-Frank, let's chop him up.
-All right.
Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?
You said chop him up.
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.
I got a better shot letting him drive.
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-It's Belle. Open up.
It's Belle. Let me in.
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing! I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years, he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.
-I've been home! I've been on the phone--
-He's playing cards.
-What'll I tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.
Keep them up all night.
I'll see you later.
Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery...
but it had nothing to do with me.
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it.
It made him sick to turn the money over to the guys who stole it.
He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?
I wasn't asking for anything.
And Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections.
Still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over.
When they found Carbone in the meat truck...
he was frozen so stiff...
it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.
He was like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people...
and even after a while, the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.
What made Jimmy so happy that morning...
was that this was the day that Tommy was being made.
Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made.
He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.
They had a signal set up, so he'd know the minute the ceremony was over.
-Ma, where are you?
-Here I am.
-You're home.
-Home? I'm leaving.
-You look lovely.
-I look good, huh?
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you. Don't paint any more religious pictures, please.
-God be with you.
-Bye, Ma.
We always called each other goodfellas.
You'd say to somebody.:
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us. "
You understand?
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew, you've got to be 100% Italian...
so they can trace your relatives back to the old country.
It's the highest honor they can give you.
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
It also means you could fuck around with anybody...
just as long as they aren't also a member.
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.
How many years ago since you were made?
-I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
-Thirty years?
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?
As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made...
it was like we were all being made.
We would now have one of our own as a member.
-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it.
-That's it.
-What do you mean?
He's gone.
That's it.
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.
-What happened?
-They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.
Are you all right?
It was revenge for Billy Batts...
and a lot of other things.
And that's that.
There was nothing we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face...
so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...
to match some silencers he had.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.
I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...
to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.
Right away, I knew he didn't want them, and I'd be stuck for the money.
I only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't.
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not paying for it.
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.
Stop the drugs. They're making your mind into mush!
-You hear me?
-I'll take them back.
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery...
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
Oh, my God.
When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
-I'm fine.
-Come on. Get over here.
-Doc, I'm fine.
-Let me check you out.
Come on.
He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...
and sent me home.
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
-Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
-I'm telling you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...
and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames...
put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...
that were cut just right...
that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
So, I was home for about an hour.
My plan was to start the dinner early...
so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...
then get the package for Lois...
to take to Atlanta for her trip later that night.
I kept looking out the window, and I saw that the helicopter was gone.
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out.
Oh, God. I see it.
-I see it. Look, it's right there.
-Damn!
-That's it.
-There it is.
We got to get to your mother's.
See, I told you.
It's funny.
-It's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house. Nothing.
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
Let's go shopping.
I'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning.
I'm telling you.
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!
I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am.
Come on, let's go inside.
-Yeah, it's gone.
-I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.
-They all right?
-Beautiful. They're great.
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah. I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.
I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you.
I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give the package a whack with quinine.
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.
I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.
-It's Sandy. What is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.
-When are you coming over?
-In an hour.
-You staying tonight, right?
-I can't. I got my brother tonight.
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.
-Hello?
-It's me. You ready?
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-I'm stirring it.
-Listen, you know what to do?
-Yeah, yeah.
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why are you bugging me? I know what to do.
You little hick, just make sure you do it.
You can be such a pain.
-Hey! Just do it!
-Okay.
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
-What did he say?
-Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah "bullshit?
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.
If anybody was listening, they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house...
and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her.
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to watch the stove.
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.
Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?
-Come on.
-You got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that. Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah, sure.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
-That the last one?
-Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table... from the plate on top of it. Stop it.
-I have to.
-You don't have to.
I got to go home.
What do you mean, you got to go home?
I've been carrying this all day.
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.
Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police! Freeze! Don't you move, you motherfucker... or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.
For a second, I thought I was dead.
But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.
I would have been dead.
Michael, lock the door!
Talk to me. When was the last time you took a collar?
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.
You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't really give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years. See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter...
were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.
You know the boys. All the pals are here.
You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a problem all night.
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
What, were you guys grocery shopping?
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
Is it good?
Bye-bye, dickhead.
See you in Attica, dick.
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money.
I got to straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're better off staying in here.
They could whack me in here as easy as outside, maybe even easier.
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.
I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead.
And I was worried about Jimmy.
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me...
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope...
the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out.
Fuck!
-Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
-I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had! I was depending on that! Why did you do that?
I had to. They were going to find it!
-They would have never found it!
-They would have, I swear to you!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that, Karen?
Oh, my God!
-I had to do it.
-Oh, my God.
Paulie, I'm really sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.
You know, I was ashamed.
I'm ashamed now.
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
$3,200.
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything? Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?
If we stay around here, we're dead.
You got it? We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
Jimmy, I don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money....
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?
As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. It's important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
-Thanks, Jimmy.
Don't worry, everything will be all right.
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
-For my mom.
-Yeah, whatever.
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.
-Thanks, Jimmy.
-Don't worry.
-I'll try.
-Don't forget, he's got to call me.
-Over here?
-Right down there.
It's over there, on the corner.
Right there.
No, go ahead. It's right in there.
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!
I'll come back later!
Karen!
What happened?
Nothing.
-What happened?
-I just got scared.
Got the keys?
-What happened, Karen?
-I just got scared. It's okay.
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.
If you're part of a crew, nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
People who cared for you all your life.
They always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there.
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.
On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine.
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.
I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the phone.
Now you understand?
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.
You know that kid from the city we were talking about? You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.
I know where he is. He's hiding now.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
No, not at all.
That way they got nothing.
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...
I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice in that matter.
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it... just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--
He's bronchial, that's why.
If he's legitimately bronchial, we'll consider that.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...
God forbid something happens to my parents, they get sick, I can't see them?
Maybe something can be worked out if they're sick... if there's extraordinary circumstances--
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.
I can't leave my parents.
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.
Frankly, I don't care whether you go or not.
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.
They want Henry, not me.
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.
If he goes into the program, you're in danger--
-I don't know anything.
-Don't give me... the babe-in-the-woods routine.
I've listened to those wiretaps, and I've heard you talk about cocaine.
Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail... or stays on the streets and beats the case, he's a dead man.
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.
We'll save your life and his life, and we'll keep you out of jail.
This morning you told the jury about your background.
It was easy for us to disappear.
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.
I never voted or paid taxes.
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was all you'd ever have to know I was alive.
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway.
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.
Your Honor, I have a document....
The hardest thing was leaving the life.
I still love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all, just for the asking.
Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along.
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive. Isn't that right?
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.
-I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it.
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence....
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...
then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.
It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce...
and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.

What the heII...
-My God!
-Jesus! Jesus!
Why, you're ItaIian.
And you... who are you?
-Were you on that train?
-Damn right I was.
Damned miserabIe woods.
You scared me to death.
These Germans, first they shoot and then ask, who's there?
You're teIIing me.
Maybe you can teII me where the heII we are.
I'd say it's Germany, huh.
Anyway, what I say is we're better off here...
-...than on the train.
-That's for sure.
That train is a bIast furnace.
-Poor bastards.
-Yes, poor them.
You know, I'm not reaIIy wounded.
I've got to be a deserter, or worse... by now.
Worse. No doubt about that.
Faking a wound...
Anyway...
It's pretty good.
It Iooks reaI, my Iad.
I saved myseIf, but I was heIped out... by a dead man, may his souI rest in peace.
With aII due respect for the dead...
I had to take his bandages.
Instead of being in
StaIingrad, I'm here.
So, I said to my men, where are we going?
What are we doing, running around Iike this?
Who wants to go around kiIIing?
Let's go. Go back home.
You can't work for peopIe... who send you out here with cardboard shoes.
Here, where when you bIow your nose you get... a crystaI chandeIier, and when you shit... you get icicIes.
So I grabbed two trucks and sent the men home.
I hope they made it.
They wouId have had me shot tomorrow.
I hate the miIitary courts here.
-How Iong is this river!
-It must be the Rhine.
-Where's that?
-It's stiII in Germany.
Then it's stiII a pain in the ass.
Damn!
-Who were they?
-Maybe they are Jews.
-That's impossibIe.
-It's possibIe... and we happen to be as guiIty as they are.
We're accompIices to those rotten shits.
Why do you think that we're accompIices?
Because we didn't make a sound... didn't come out and spit in their faces.
We couId have, but we ran instead.
That's crazy.
How couId we have?
They'd have come after us and we'd be shot.
UseIess suicide.
No, it wouIdn't have been useIess... because in the face of certain things you've got... to say no, and instead,
I said yes... to MussoIini, to duty, and to aII that crap.
In this war I've kiIIed... bastards I didn't even know.
I kiIIed before the war, but I had my reasons.
I kiII Iike an idiot, for no reason.
Did it for a woman.
I kiIIed for a woman...
A woman...
She must be kidding!
What more do you want?
Screw off!
Let's see you dance... waIking crow!
Screw off! Drop dead.
How about Ietting me tickIe you aII over?
You can tickIe your Mama!
I'II give you something, so don't push.
Nothing easy about me!
-What a Iass!
-We want more!
What do you want me to do?
There! There!
Give us more!
-Take it off!
-Come on!
Forget it! Fuck you!
There! There!
-PasquaIino!
-Let's taIk, Concetti.
Look at yourseIf in the mirror.
Go on, take a Iook at yourseIf.
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.
You're not even inteIIigent.
Among Mom and our sisters... there isn't a penny.
I'm the onIy man in the house with eight women... there's one thing
I've tried to defend.
One thing, our honor!
To defend and protect that honor as best I can... not being the biggest or strongest man in the worId.
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.
They know about it, and they have to respect us.
And you ugIy, miserabIe pig... put your disgusting thighs in dispIay... in a musicaI... because that Iousy rat said he'd make you famous.
That fiIthy bastard who heIped to get you started... and gave you this job.
I'II kiII him.
-No!
-I'II shoot him.
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'II marry me!
He promised!
I'm going on 37.
I'II be a spinster!
Better a spinster than a whore!
-I must kiII him.
-No!
Potono'II marry me.
First he'II make me somebody...
-...then his bride.
-Somebody!
Somebody! Come on...
Look at yourseIf, a squawking crow.
Didn't you hear them?
DisgracefuI! What a shame!
I'II kiII that Potono!
No, I'm through! I have a much better contract.
He'II heIp me sing at the CIub Margarita... then he'II marry me.
He made a promise.
He Ioves me very much.
One month, eh?
I give him one month... to straighten things up.
Our house mustn't be dishonored.
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?
Imagine the eIdest becoming a whore!
What wiII the others do, become whores?
He's got a month to to marry you... or I'II kiII him.
The word of PasquaIino
Seven Beauties.
Do you understand?
Rosina, my carnation.
Coming right up, PasquaIino.
Damn Francesco! After aII this time in Africa.
Now they're sending him to Spain.
We needed another war.
It wasn't enough Iast time.
Now we'II never get married.
Don't give up hope. Because with God's heIp... he may stiII be Iucky enough to get a nice wound... in his Ieg or his arm.
You'd get a pension for Iife and you'd be set.
-What are you saying?
-Or he'II Iose an eye.
What crazy taIk, Mama!
Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy such Iucky accidents...
-...in our famiIy.
-Yes, of course.
It wiII pass.
Grandma.
Rough up those mattresses.
PasquaIino,
Ieave it in the drawer.
Are you Iooking for troubIe?
Hey, Mama, it doesn't get you into troubIe...
They Iearn to fear you, and respect you.
And beIieve me, they aII respect me.
Excuse us for a moment, famiIy business.
You'II pardon us?
He has to taIk to them in private.
We have business to discuss.
-It's a big secret.
-Who gives a damn!
Quiet. You can't trust them to Iick Leno's famiIy...
Is that cIear?
Mama, Iook, money to buy groceries.
-Lucky Mama.
-I'm sick of bread and onions.
Buy an egg for each one of you... and be carefuI of cheats.
It'd disgust anybody... to Iook at such yeIIow faces.
There's a Iot to be done if they're ever to get married.
Stop that!
Now, Iisten to me.
Don't Iet anybody see your eyes, Iook down... or you may be taken for a cheap IittIe tart.
And I'II beat the first one who misbehaves. Remember.
SmiIe, no reason to be upset Iike that.
Cheer up.
Have a good day.
And you too, LouiseIIe.
And you too. Hmm?
Don't Iook so gIoomy, eh?
SmiIe for a change!
What's the matter with you?
What the heII do you think you're doing?
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!
LittIe girI, have your parrot teII my fortune.
-Why the tears?
-It's my mother's fauIt.
I never couId sing,
I go off pitch.
To make me sing is wrong.
Don't make fun of me.
But it doesn't matter, you can yeII.
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.
Can't you answer back?
If anyone faiIs to respect you...
You just say that you're my fiancee. Hmm?
In these words.
Say you're engaged to
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
But I'm not your fiancee.
It's faIse.
At the moment. In a few years, things couId happen.
Never try to predict the weather, or the future.
Think about growing up.
Say, come on, try.
Even you started steaIing from the cradIe.
JeaIousy is an ugIy thing.
Excuse me, Don RaphaeIe,
I don't understand.
What's the matter?
I've aIways been IoyaI.
It's not about IoyaIty.
I'm interested in peopIe who know how to show respect.
What are you taIking about?
What are you referring to?
I'II teII you what I'm referring to.
I'm taIking about someone... who doesn't respect his famiIy.
-In what sense?
-I'II teII you.
At 3 o'cIock, you'd better be at the PoIonetto.
Have a Iook around. See what they're doing to you.
Potono bought your sister a pair of shoes... with red bows on them, and put her in there for Iife.
We have a cIient.
My God! It's my brother!
-Who is he?
-No, it's her brother!
Prostitute!
Stupid bitch!
Are you satisfied now... your fiance got you into this business? Idiot!
What a disgrace! You brought dishonor on us!
Let go! Get the heII out of my way!
TeII me where he is... or I'II murder you, do you hear me?!
How do I find that son of a bitch?!
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!
This is how he married you, that Iousy bastard.
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?
-Right here.
-FiIth! Go home!
How can I, dressed this way?
-Take this.
-Go Iike this.
Go home!
No, PasquaIino! No!
Don't kiII him!
I Iove him, pIease!
Screw you and your Iove! Idiot!
Eighteen Karat Potono, is that you?
-Damn right.
-Damn right.
Weren't you going to marry my sister, Concettina?
You promised and therefore you'II marry her.
Who are you? Who the heII do you think you are?
MiserabIe worm. Get out.
I didn't understand.
Does that heIp you understand? Have a good day.
-Poor boy.
-WiII he be aII right?
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is that rotten son of a bitch? Where'd he go?
It's reaIIy not worth bothering about.
Isn't it? I'm going to chop his head off.
Scum, humiIiating me.
He won't Iive Iong.
Eighteen Karat Potono... wake up!
I won't shoot out the brains of a sIeeping man.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up. It's me.
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.
You're the one who caused it.
You caIIed me miserabIe worm, remember?
Find that pistoI, I need it.
Find it and be quick! It's important to my defense.
He's dead.
Where the heII are we?
Hey, Jesus, what...
I smeII onions.
Ah, Signora.
Good morning, goet morgen.
Excuse me for coming in without permission. Stay quiet.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm hungry.
I'm an ItaIian soIdier.
Understand? No?
That's aII right.
FrauIien Deutsche.
Oh, something to eat.
ItaIian soIdier, NapIes.
Sunshine, bIue water... mandoIins.
Understand? A pizza pie with tomatoes on top... or macaroni. There's food in here. I'm starving!
Ah, Deutsche soup.
Nice and hot.
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'II have some bread... with your permission.
Oh, bread with stew?
It's so good. Our Mama often gave us stew in NapIes.
A Mama, Signora, is never forgotten.
You're a Mama too. Your daughter at the piano... she'II catch coId with her bare ass out.
Hard times, Signora, the war's been responsibIe.
Shh, if someone's there,
I... no, it's aII right.
Soup, bread, potatoes...
I'm taking some bread for my friend.
He's ItaIian.
This is for him.
A drop of wine, cin-cin, saIute.
Good wine. Guten.
I'd Iike to be your guest...
Your daughter, she has a great ass... but I have to run.
Thank you.
May you Iive to be a hundred.
Oh, saIami... saIami and some cheese.
Dankeschun, Bitteschun, auf wiedersehn...
Good night, Signora.
What's that about?
Groundsport. A mysterious word, amigo.
We must work occasionaIIy, or eIse acid bath...
-...or crematorium.
-How d'you know? Who're you?
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.
I know an anarchist whose bombs didn't work.
MussoIini, HitIer,
CeIIezar.
I've got faiIure after faiIure.
These peopIe have made a business out of death.
That goddamn rotten whore!
What's the worId coming to?
How the heII did the worId ever get Iike this?
And we Iet ourseIves get kiIIed this way.
Nobody says anything.
The Jews, who were supposed to be so smart...
The brave Russians... who began the revoIution... they're not rebeIIing.
My rotten Iuck, ending up in this shitpiIe.
Jesus! They're pIaying waItz.
My God! My God!
Like sheep about to be sIaughtered.
It can't be.
Francesco,
I don't want to die.
I can't accept that.
I'm stiII young.
I had a miserabIe Iife.
I wouId've Iiked to change it, but I never managed to.
I can't die Iike this.
I just can't die Iike this.
I'II try and get out of here.
I'II do it! I'II find a way to get out of here...
Starting at this moment.
A woman is a woman,
PasquaIino.
And a woman, even one who is an eviI person, has... a IittIe good for someone who can reach her heart.
There's a bit of sugar aIways there.
The song goes...
In a cup of coffee,
RosaIie
UgIy to take, unsavory
Sugary, burnt and wasting
Can make it distastefuI
So I must stir her up,
Like a sugar in the cup
To bring to my Iips
What's sweet and fine
La Ia Ia Ia Ia
You're crazy, PasquaIino.
Yes, but I must try.
It's dangerous.
She's crueI, sadistic.
I understand aII that.
But I had a vision.
It was a song, something my Mama said... that bit of sugar,
I know it's there.
Soon, no matter how rotten she is... or how eviI, she's no exception.
She must need Iove.
I'm right, Franche.
You're educated, but in the matter of women...
-I'm way ahead of you.
-I'm sure you'd be.
Do you know how peopIe used to caII me?
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
-They did?
-Because I'm ugIy.
You Iook terribIe, aII right.
But that was the point.
In spite of my Iooks...
I appeaIed to women.
They Ioved me.
PeopIe were amazed.
They'd say, it's unbeIievabIe. he's repuIsive.
Others repIied... he must have the Seven Beauties...
That's how it came to be my name, see?
No, but I beIieve you.
I appeaI to the Iadies.
I used to appeaI to them.
The fact is... without any exaggeration...
I haven't Iooked at the mirror in years.
And since I know from the beginning... that I've aIways been an ugIy man...
I'II admit it's been bothering me.
How have I turned out?
My teeth have become Ioose.
I can't keep my eyes open.
My ass has dropped.
Look at me and teII me honestIy.
How do I Iook?
AwfuI, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.
No! I'm bound to be kiIIed, so why not?
I want to Iive, have chiIdren.
See my chiIdren's chiIdren, and more... and the chiIdren of my chiIdren's chiIdren.
AII the chiIdren
I can possibIy have.
-BuIIshit, amigo.
-You pig!
How dare you teII me what to do!
Who are you?! How dare you insuIt me Iike that?!
Come on, that's nonsense, you're taIking buIIshit... because the more chiIdren you have... the faster the end wiII come.
In what sense?
What do you mean?
In the year 1400 there were
500 miIIion peopIe on earth.
By the year 1850 the amount had doubIed to one biIIion.
Now we're aII... extremeIy indignant... because of the death of 20 miIIion men... but in 200 or 300 years... there'II be a Iot more of us, 30 biIIion or more.
Anywhere you go on earth wiII be worse than here.
That's when men are going to butcher each other... and murder an entire famiIy... for a piece of bread or an appIe... and the worId wiII end.
Too bad, because
I beIieve in man... but soon... very soon, a new man...
A new man wiII be born.
He'II have to be civiIized... not this beast who's been endowed with inteIIigence... and obIiterated the harmony in the worId... and brought about totaI destruction... just by disturbing nature's equiIibrium.
A new man... abIe to rediscover the harmony that's within.
You mean, put things in order?
Order? No, no...
The orderIy ones are the Germans.
A new man in disorder is our onIy hope.
A new man in disorder.
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.
You shouId've waited untiI he got his revoIver out.
I waited about 5 minutes, but... he didn't have a gun around.
He didn't have a weapon.
You shouIdn't have shot him... or given Potono a gun.
I onIy had one.
You shouId've had two with you.
You can't never be carefuI enough.
This case demanded the simpIest of care.
You must prepare for the job.
You shouId throw him his gun, defend yourseIf.
He picks the gun up, you shoot him.
You didn't murder him.
SeIf-defense.
Later on, the case comes up, a quick triaI.
In no time you're out and you're respected.
It's a breeze, get it?
Don RaphaeI, how couId I have known?
A reaI man prepares a job with foresight... or eIse anyone at aII wouId be abIe to do it.
Now you're in troubIe... of making it aII disappear.
50% is aII you can hope to get out of it moraIIy.
I'm taIking about respect.
You must make yourseIf a name.
You need Iots of pubIicity.
For this you need discretion.
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.
It's a supposition, but we must be sure.
-He's disappeared.
-Sounds simpIe.
How am I to fix it?
Throw him in the bay?
It'II rise to the top... you'II go straight to prison.
MarveIous, perfect, dammit!
Dear God.
Imagination. A creative effort's needed.
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.
Smoking cigarettes, anybody can do that.
The man who wants to be something more... needs the guts to perform!
The nerve to do things that normaIIy... no one eIse couId possibIy imagine. Get the point?
I get the point,
Don RaphaeI.
You seem nervous, my boy.
-CaIm down, my boy.
-I am caIm.
There are men at the mention of whose name... the whoIe worId trembIes.
-Get my point, PasquaIino?
-I get it.
You're inteIIigent... you foIIow everything
I teII you.
I foIIow, Don RaphaeI.
As I expIained... you couId make a great start for yourseIf... with this opportunity, or not.
Of course, it's entireIy up to you.
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention... to anyone who taIks about the American system.
TraditionaI cement shoes were invented here in NapIes.
Chicago and New York just make cheap imitations.
It's pIagiarism.
The king-size coffin is our invention.
When you see a funeraI in NapIes, nobody knows... how many bodies are in the coffin.
When things get busy,
2 or 3 can be stuffed in.
Depends on the demand.
We invented everything here in NapIes.
For exampIe, you know the ancient graveyard... weII, when they first opened it... they found 500 skeIetons.
Now, there are 5,000.
The question is, who put the other 4,500 in there?
So, as I said, it depends on the demand.
Oh, God.
He's so ugIy.
Wait a minute, here.
Son of a bitch.
Even dead, you are a pig.
Just a big bag of wind.
I knew it.
Dammit!
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Who are you?
Who is it?
Who's there?
What's going on?
Who's there?
What's going on?
-Get going.
-Where to?
To the station.
And hurry.
Damn stupid animaI!
BIind idiot!
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf!
You have no respect for a poor bIind man!
Son of a bitch!
What is this? Stay back.
Keep your hands off me, pIease. Get back.
WiII you get back!
I don't want any heIp.
I'II manage myseIf.
I don't need heIp. PIease.
-I can manage myseIf.
-He's so strong!
Look. A big cheese box roped up wrong.
CouId you pIease take these?
Thanks.
How did you rap it?
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!
-Where are you going?
-PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
You know that shipment of ProkoIoni.
It's been sent off.
PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
Good-bye.
It was your advice
I foIIowed... about creative thinking.
I don't think you'II hear about it anymore.
He kiIIed my Potono!
PoIice! He kiIIed him!
Live me aIone...
Give up!
You'II never take
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
Never wiII you be abIe to take him aIive.
-Stop bragging.
-So I'm wrong.
Achtung! Achtung!
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't worry.
-Where are you going?
-Be quiet.
Shit!
Monster of NapIes confesses!
It's PasquaIino and no other. Latest edition!
Big murder story!
-So, you have confessed.
-Yes, Sir.
Nobody in his right mind ever confessed such a thing.
CompIete madness!
I wiII Iook ridicuIous.
What the heII do you think
I can teII the judge, huh?
It's impossibIe to defend this case.
Advocate, this time I Iost.
I'm gIad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.
You're an asshoIe.
How dare you!
You'II pay for that!
CaIm down, or that'II be...
-the end of my visit.
-Who the heII are you?
Your Iawyer.
Do you want to kiII me as weII?
-Better hoId your tongue.
-Watch that asshoIe stuff.
I wanted to say incompetent.
It's not so simpIe.
I have a great reputation.
You understand, or not?
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.
How can I defend you if you teII the truth.
The monster of NapIes is captured and confesses.
Who ever heard of such a thing? Confesses...
It's unbeIievabIe!
Look, confesses to cutting up the victim... and shipping the body to 3 different cities.
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...
The onIy thing Ieft for us to do... is pIead insanity.
-I don't get it.
-I'II cIaim you're mad... out of your mind.
ReaIIy? I have to deny an honorabIe act... aimed at protecting the
Ioss of dignity... and pretend I'm a fooI.
Let's forget it, my friend.
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?
You're confused.
Look, they're going to condemn you to death, huh?
It's the firing squad.
I can't pIay the fooI.
I'm sorry about
Don RaphaeI... but I'II have to send you away.
You'II give me a scoop, understand?
-I won't do it.
-What shouId I do?
I have high bIood pressure.
I've got to stay caIm.
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity...
I'II defend you... and we may save your neck.
But if you prefer your stupid honor... we'II forget about it, and you're dead.
It's your Iife or your honor.
Think about it, PasquaIino
Porfusso, and Iet me know.
AII right, then, you can see your visitors.
Let the famiIy in now.
Mama! Mama! Mama!
-PasquaIino.
-Mama! -PasquaIino!
-Mama! -My PasquaIino!
-Mama!
-PasquaIino, my son!
-Mama!
Mama.
-My son. -Mama.
-At Iast I can see you.
You're teIIing me...
How you are?
I'm not so weII.
How about you?
Does Don RaphaeI give you anything?
He's been heIping us a IittIe... but not with money, just words... so it's been Ieft for us to manage somehow.
How do you manage?
I'II do aII I can...
-Concettina!
-PasquaIino!
He's a friend.
What do you want?
Your Iawyer's one of the best here in NapIes... recommended by Don RaphaeI.
He costs a Iot.
You did commit the crime.
She's not innocent...
It's one matter not being innocent.
Being a whore is another.
Now sweetheart, have a IittIe patience.
A rotten comedy, a Iousy farce... caIIed Iiving.
Your ass wiII drop... and your beIIy'II get fat without exercise.
Come on, run.
Keep the body beautifuI.
You'II be as good as new.
-ItaIians!
-What now?
Let's weIcome the war for the virtues it brings out... in those of us who have the guts to fight!
We're making history.
Our peopIe are... a race of distant warriors!
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!
It's very funny.
Our peopIe are poets and heroes.
-He's out of his mind.
-And that is their fame.
The chaIIenge this breed poses is a threat...
-to aII on earth.
-Take him away, eh?
PoIiticaI?
-No, hatchet kiIIer.
-Oh.
PasquaIino Porfuso,
'The Monster of NapIes'.
The act of an unbaIanced mind, 12 years.
You're Iucky. They gave me
28 years and 4 months.
Twenty-eight?!
How did it come to that?
I simpIy thought.
It's the most atrocious crime a citizen couId commit.
He doesn't want that.
-Ah, you're anti-fascist.
-SociaIist.
To teII the truth, poIitics are boring.
I've other interests.
Papa was a brickIayer. He taIked a IittIe SociaIism.
But I don't think about it anymore... because... because I think
II Duce is pretty great.
To be truthfuI, he's given us roads.
How much he's given, an entire empire.
AII the other countries are jeaIous of our Ieader.
Listening to the man speak to us... that voice, and those eyes... and his court found me compIeteIy insane.
And our peopIe are respected.
They used to spit at us,
ItaIians, on the face.
Remember those days?
Besides, there were many strikes, riots... demonstrations, we used to be in terribIe condition.
And thanks to him, there has been no disorder.
He is a marveI, you're right.
There has been Iaw and order, and... he's done it by outIawing unions and strikes.
The resuIt is that saIaries in 1919 were up... and today, peopIe are making Iess than haIf... whiIe the cost of Iiving has increased 30%.
You didn't know that, huh?
This MussoIini, of whom everyone envies us...
Do you know who envies us?
The IandIords!
The ItaIians are a bunch of fooIs...
Iistening to that man, that bag of air on his baIcony.
Your Duce.
Wait, wait... no.
CarefuI, they'II hear us.
You mentioned the strikes, and the riots?
At Ieast then we knew there was a disease... and we couId hope to get weII.
Now we imagine we're strong... and we hide the disease.
That man wiII bring our country to war.
That's the finaI catastrophe.
You put it weII.
What do you intend to do?
I don't bother with poIitics.
I go to the insane asyIum, stay there for 10 years.
It's just a question of getting things organized... becoming friendIy with some doctor or some nurse.
In NapIes, we're very inventive.
I might get assigned to cIean the women's quarters.
Then I'II have it made.
I'II be on Easy Street.
What do you know, you're awake.
Let me see how weII you've done.
-A IittIe bit.
-That's not much.
Not enough.
To pee is to Iive.
The more you pee, the more you Iive.
PasquaIino, how are you doing?
Do you Iike your new job as intended?
Keep up the good work.
I'm starting procedure... for a new psychiatric test.
You'II see, they'II Iet you out.
We have to put an end to this...
AII the judiciaI cases who end up here...
What are you doing?
What do you think?
A gift from heaven can't go to waste.
I've had no woman now for severaI months.
I'm so sorry, but I must ask you to forgive me.
I must, must have a Iook.
Just keep quiet. Leave it to me, I'm an expert.
Let me pIease you.
You want it.
Stupid bitch! Go to heII!
Shut up. Shut up, you idiot!
Shut up!
What do you want from me?
That'II keep you quiet.
I'II take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.
Now we'II show you.
Get his pants off.
Come on, move.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here.
Then we'II Ieave, aII of us.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here...
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
Even though you've done these terribIe things... you're normaI, you can't be shut up in here... with these hopeIess cases.
But you must controI yourseIf.
You know what a revision of your mentaI status entaiIs.
Your behavior is what counts most.
Eight more years here couId drive me crazy.
-I reaIIy mean it.
-I know, I know... but you must make an effort because now is your chance.
PasquaIino, ItaIy is at war now... and they'II be needing aII the men they can get.
They can't be fussy about anyone who voIunteers... even someone coming out of prison.
Of course, this doesn't appIy to mentaI patients.
But if we'II ran psychiatric tests... to demonstrate you've made a compIete recovery...
HeIp me.
I want to go on Iiving.
That isn't asking so much.
HeIp me.
HeIp me...
I'II try my best for you but...
I'm afraid this war wiII end in a terribIe massacre.
It couIdn't be more terribIe than in here.
I'm ready to do anything to get out of here.
I'm ready to do anything to Iive... anything.
I'm ready to do anything...
Crematorium zeks.
AII right. What exactIy is your game, shit macaroni?
Jesus, you speak ItaIian!
Then I can taIk to you.
At Iast, I can taIk to you.
Who are... who are you?
An enchantress, or a magician?
Because you put a speII on me.
When I saw you the first time...
I was... I...
What are you saying, you disgusting macaroni?
I Iove... I'm in Iove with you.
I Iove you very much.
Strip.
What? Did I hear right?
You asked me to strip?
AII right.
I'm wiIIing because I'd
Iike to make you Iaugh... because I Iove you.
You hate me.
You aII despise me.
You want something to eat.
You Iove me to get something to eat...
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.
But what goes on inside my heart...
You have no idea.
You're right. Everybody hates you. I shouId too.
I shouId hate you because I've never seen... a woman Iike you.
I have to admit
I'm crazy... but the reason I'm crazy is because... because I'm not convinced you are as you seem.
Who are you reaIIy?
I need to know who you are.
TeII me the truth.
No. Of course you're not a witch or an enchantress.
I'm convinced you're just a poor victim. Yes.
You're a victim because you're forced into... forced to kiII...
You kiII out of a sense of duty.
Not a witch at aII, you are a victim, Iike we are.
There's a reaI femaIe under that uniform... and imagine the rosy fIesh, deIicate and beautifuI... and soft to touch.
It drives me out of my head.
Yes, I've gone out of my head.
To caress sainted fIesh is something I dream about...
Yes, I can hardIy stand on my feet.
I think of you and I become weak.
I'm in Iove. Love is madness, it's a disease.
When you're in Iove, you
Iose aII perspective...
I've gone crazy thinking of you.
That's why I did what I did and that's why I'm here now.
And that's why I'm asking you one big favor, one.
I'm going to be kiIIed and
I ask to be kiIIed by you.
By the touch of your hand.
I beg you, touch me... and I'd be very gIad if you'd kiII me now. Touch me.
You shit, NeopoIitan.
You can hardIy stand.
You cannot keep on pIaying in this comedy of yours.
You want to eat.
Now, you'II make
Iove to me... then I'II kiII you with my bare hands. Verstanden?
-It's what you asked, no?
-Yes, thank you.
You have to be patient.
I Iove you, but I'm weak.
You can't even open your eyes.
You don't have the energy for an erection.
Wake up!
Better eat, NapIes.
Now you eat, afterward you fuck.
If you don't fuck, you're kaput.
Bibi, my first Iove... heIp me get it up.
I want to see your eyes.
Drek.
You disgust me.
Your thirst for Iife disgusts me.
Your Iove disgusts me.
In Paris, there is a Greek... who found strength to make Iove to a goose.
He screwed for what it gave him... something to eat.
It meant survivaI.
And you, sub-human ItaIian.
You found the strength for an erection.
And because you were strong you'II manage to Iive on... and eventuaIIy you'II win.
MiserabIe creature, Iacking in ideaIs and ideas... and we... we who thought to create a master race... are doomed to faiIure.
You're in Barracks No.23, right? Good.
Starting right now, you're to be in charge.
That's an order.
As head of Barracks 23... you are to designate any 6 that you Iike... to be eIiminated at once.
Ya.
Or eIse I eIiminate aII the men.
You are to choose any 6.
And the others may get something to eat... even survive.
You pick 6, or you'II aII be creminated. Understand?
Kaput.
The choice is yours.
You pig, you rotten dirty.
Now you're a butcher Iike the rest of us.
FiIthy sub-human ItaIian.
-No.
-I've got to.
The bitch said so.
Either 6 or aII of us.
Every Iast one of them is doomed to die.
At Ieast we'II save our ass.
No. We'II be just
Iike them...
That's what they want.
We must say no.
And aII the men wiII be dead tomorrow?
AII the men, tomorrow.
Screw off.
Say what you want... but remember who's boss.
Here, Group 3. Whoever they may be, I'm not interested.
Into 14. I don't want to know who they are.
Here, the first 6.
You need onIy 5.
-What do you mean?
-I voIunteer.
You're crazy. Why?
Because I'm fed up with this.
Come on, get in Iine.
It's an order!
It's an order, go on!
Number 9423...
Somebody smuggIed food into Barracks 23.
In addition, stoIen property of the 3rd Reich... was found in Barracks 23.
As punishment for the breaking of reguIations... these 6 men wiII face a firing squad.
Hey!
Enough with this fear!
I've had enough! Living in aII this dark terror!
I'm going to throw myseIf in the shit...
Screw you!
Stop!
Stop!
A man in disorder!
Get him out.
FiIthy rats! Bastards!
Lousy rotten sons of bitches! You fiIth!
-Francesco!
-Dirty pigs!
-Francesco!
-FiIthy murderers!
Enough of your fiIthy kiIIing!
Lousy, rotten, no good animaIs!
-Let me by!
-You're not even men!
France!
Leave him to me.
-Give me...
-SiIIy bastards!
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.
PIease faII down.
Just pretend...
FaII down on the ground.
No, I don't want to Iive any Ionger!
Death can't be any worse than this!
FaII down! Pretend.
PIease shut up!
I'd rather die than
Iive in this shit.
I'II have the satisfaction of yeIIing at them...
-FiIthy pigs!
-You're mad!
-Inhuman sons of bitches!
-France.
Rotten animaIs!
God, what do they want?
What do they want?
I won't shoot him.
Shoot.
Shoot. Hurry up, you'II be freeing me...
Come on, shoot!
Somebody eIse wiII shoot me if you won't.
At Ieast you're my friend.
Now, shoot, pIease...
You'II be doing me a favor.
Shoot!
I won't be tortured any more.
Don't you understand?
I can't pIay the hero much Ionger.
Don't make me ashamed in front of the others.
Shoot! Do me a favor...
Come on!
Go on, shoot, dammit.
Mama, guess!
It's PasquaIino!
PasquaIino is aIive!
He's aIive, I don't beIieve it!
He's aIive! PasquaIi!
PasquaIi! My boy is aII right!
And so you turned out to be a whore too, huh?
Yes.
And did you earn enough to get aIong?
Yes.
Good. Now quick, you're giving it up... we're getting married.
There isn't much time to Iose.
I want chiIdren.
Many chiIdren: 25, 30.
It's a matter of seIf-defense.
They must be strong.
Look at the crowds out there.
Soon, they'II be murdering each other... famiIies sIaughtered, for an appIe.
So we must see to it our famiIy is Iarge.
That'II be our defense, understand?
I've aIways Ioved you very much.
And I'm ready.
We'II get married, the sooner the better.
PIease, PasquaIino, don't worry...
Thank the Madonna for returning you to us.
One mustn't Iook back on what's passed.
It's so senseIess.
What's done is done.
Have a Iook at yourseIf, my son.
You're beautifuI.
The war is ended.
It's useIess to think about these miseries...
PasquaIino, you're aIive.
AIive!
Yes, I'm aIive.
Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the left.
Thank you.
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yes.
- I'm Jack Torrance.
- Oh, come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my secretary, Susie.
- Hello.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.
That's very good time.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
- Susie.
- Sure.
And ask Bill Watson to join us.
Yes, I will.
Mom?
Yeah?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure I do.
It'll be lots of fun.
Yeah. I guess so.
Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony?
He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.
I don't want to go there.
How come you don't want to go?
I just don't.
Let's just wait and see.
We're all going to have a real good time.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
How do you do, Bill?
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
I'd like you to take him around soon as we're through.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.
What line of work are you in now?
I'm a writer.
Teaching's been more or less a way of making ends meet.
This ought to be quite a change for you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...
...I agree with them.
Let's see, where were we?
I was about to explain...
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.
Then we close down completely until the following May.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?
It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
It would be. The problem is the enormous cost...
...it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open.
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.
It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.
There's just no way to make it economically feasible...
...to keep it clear.
When the place was built in 1907...
...there was very little interest in winter sports.
This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
It's certainly got plenty of that.
That's right.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...
...about what the job entails?
Only in a very general way.
Well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...
...and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...
...heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...
...repairing damage as it occurs...
...and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...
...is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.
I'm outlining a new writing project.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good, Jack.
Because, for some people...
...solitude...
...and isolation...
...can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it'?
They'll love it.
Great.
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...
...there's one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...
...but it's been known to give a few people...
...second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they said anything in Denver...
...about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.
I don't believe they did.
We||....
My predecessor in this job...
...hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and two little girls of about 8 and 10.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I've been told, he seemed...
...like a completely normal individual.
But at some point during the winter...
...he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.
He ran amuck...
...and killed his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...
...he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...
...that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...
...when people are shut in together over long periods of time.
Wow.
That is...
...quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.
But it did.
And, uh...
...I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...
...left it for you to tell me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...
...from staying in a place where something like that happened.
You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.
She's a confirmed ghost story...
...and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad'|| get the job?
He already did.
He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.
Hello.
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.
I don't think I can get home before 9:00 or 10:00.
Sounds like you got the job.
Right. It's a beautiful place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?
I don't know.
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.
I don't want to.
Please.
No.
Now, Tony, tell me.
Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.
That's good. Now the other one.
Good boy.
Now, Danny...
...when you were brushing your teeth...
...do you remember if you smelled anything funny...
...or saw any bright, flashing lights or anything at all strange?
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."
Now, Danny, can you remember what you were doing...
...just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No. He's a little boy that lives in my mouth.
Tony's his imaginary friend.
Oh.
If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
I don't want to talk about Tony anymore.
OK
That's fine.
All right, Danny.
I'm going to ask you to do me a favor...
...and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?
Do I have to?
Yes. I'd like you to.
We're going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.
I'll come back and check on you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.
I'm quite sure there's nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Yeah?
Oh.
He seems absolutely fine now.
But you should've seen him.
I know.
Kids can scare you to death.
But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.
And they look much worse than they are.
But what was the matter with him?
Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.
They're brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.
They're more akin to autohypnosis...
...a kind of self-induced trance.
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...
...we can always think about having some tests done.
No, thank you.
I'm sure you're right.
Have you been in Boulder long?
Only about three months.
We're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend....
Tony.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
No, um....
Let's see....
I guess Danny started talking to Tony...
...about the time we put him in nursery school.
Did he adjust well to school?
No.
He didn't like it too much at first.
Then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while and....
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
He dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?
It was just one of those things, you know.
Purely an accident.
My husband had been drinking...
...and he came home about three hours late.
So he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.
And Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room...
...and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them.
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...
...you know, in a park or in the street.
But on this particular occasion...
...my husband just used too much strength...
...and he injured Danny's arm.
Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said:
"Wendy, I'm never going to touch another drop.
And if I do, you can leave me."
And he didn't.
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.
BOY-
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.
Mm-hm.
Dad?
Yes?
I'm hungry-
You should've eaten your breakfast.
We'll get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.
Okay, Mom.
Wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
Oh.
What was the Donner party?
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to in order to survive.
Jack.
Don't worry, Mom.
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.
See, it's okay.
He saw it on the television.
- What time does the plane leave?
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.
Good morning. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No problem. We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?
No, my son's discovered the games room.
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.
Oh, fine.
In view of all we have to cover today...
...I suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrance's things brought to their apartment.
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.
Oh, yes.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It's beautiful.
My God!
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?
It sure is.
I've never seen anything like this before.
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?
I believe they're based...
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
They're really gorgeous.
As a matter of fact...
...this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
This old place has had an illustrious past.
In its heyday, it was a stopping place for the jet setters...
...even before anybody knew what a jet set was.
We had four presidents who stayed here.
Lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.
And a small bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Well, then. Place is very nicely self-contained.
Easy to keep.
Cozy.
Yes, very cozy for a family.
If you feel like spreading out...
...you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Well, it's very...
...homey.
Yeah.
This is our famous hedge maze.
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...
...and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself.
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't want to go in there...
...unless I had an hour to spare to find my way out.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1907.
It was finished in 1909.
The site's supposed to be on an Indian burial ground.
They actually had to repel...
...a few Indian attacks as they were building it.
That's our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
Yes.
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.
It won't take you long to get the hang of it.
As a matter of fact, we brought a decorator in from Chicago...
...just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.
Oh, I'll say!
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.
Boy, we could really have a good party in this room.
I'm afraid you won't do too well here unless you brought supplies.
We remove the booze from the premises when we shut down.
That reduces the insurance we normally have to carry.
We don't drink.
Then you're in luck.
Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
This is Dick Hallorann, our head chef.
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.
Glad to meet you.
The Torrances will take care of the Overlook this winter.
That's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It's just wonderful.
Hi, Danny!
I found him outside looking for you.
Dan, did you get tired of bombing the universe?
Yeah.
Come on over here.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.
I think it'd be good if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...
...while I continue on with Jack.
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.
Great. See you later, hon.
Bye, darling.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.
Now, are you a "Winnie," or a "Freddie"?
I'm a Wendy.
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.
This is the kitchen, huh?
This is it.
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
Don't let it get you down.
It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen.
A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food.
You folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk-in freezer.
This is where we keep all of our meat.
You got 15 rib roasts...
".30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.
We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens...
...50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast...
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?
- No.
- You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?
French fries and ketchup.
I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along, now.
Watch your step.
Mr. Hallorann...
...how'd you know we call him Doc?
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.
- I did?
- Yeah.
We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I probably heard you call him that.
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...
...calling him that since we've been with you.
Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?
Eh, what's up, Doc?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep...
...all the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...
...canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk....
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?
Sociables, finger rolls...
...and 7 kinds of what have you.
Now, we've got dried peaches, dried apricots...
...dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.
I promise we won't keep her very long.
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.
- You like ice cream, Doc?
- Yeah.
I thought you did.
You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait?
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
- Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you like?
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.
It's amazing, all this activity today.
The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the...
...last day's always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
- Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I can remember when I was a little boy...
...my grandmother and I could hold conversations...
...entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She called it "shining."
And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us...
...that had "the shine" to us.
Just like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...
...though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it.
How long have you been able to do it?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that...
...tells you things?
Yes.
How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Yes.
Do they know he tells you things?
Tony told me never to tell them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don't know.
Now think real hard, Doc.
Think.
Maybe he showed me something.
Try to think of what it was.
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared of this place?
No.
Scared of nothing here.
It's just that...
...you know, some places are like people.
Some shine...
...and some don't.
I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel...
...has something about it that's like shining.
Is there something bad here?
Well...
...you know, Doc, when something happens...
...it can leave a trace of itself behind.
Say, like...
...if someone burns toast.
We||....
Maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice.
But things that people who shine can see.
Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet...
...well...
...sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago.
I think a lot of things happened right here...
...in this particular hotel over the years.
And not all of them was good.
What about room 237?
Room 237?
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?
No, I ain't.
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?
Nothing.
There ain't nothing in room 237.
But you ain't got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand? Stay out!
Good morning, hon.
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It's about 11:30.
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
I made them just the way you like them, sunny-side up.
Nice.
It's really pretty outside.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas.
No good ones.
Something will come.
It's just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
Yep. That's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I love it.
I really do.
I've never been this happy or comfortable anywhere.
It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.
I tell you, when we first came up here...
...I thought it was kind of scary.
I fell in love with it right away.
When I came up here for my interview...
...it was as though
I'd been here before.
I mean, we all have moments of déjà vu...
...but this was ridiculous.
It was almost as though I knew...
...what was going to be around every corner.
Ooh-woo-ooh.
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!
Look out!
I'm coming in close.
Loser has to keep America clean.
- Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.
Okay. Danny, you win.
Let's take the rest of this walking.
- Okay.
- Whew.
Give me your hand.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah.
Dead end.
Woo, we made it.
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.
It's so pretty.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big. Did you?
Nope.
Rutherford was serving a life sentence...
...for a 1968 shooting.
And the search continues for that missing Aspen woman.
Twenty-four-year-old Susan Robertson has been missing 10 days.
She disappeared on a hunting trip with her husband.
They may have to call off the search...
...if a predicted snowstorm moves in tomorrow.
It's so beautiful in Denver today...
...it's hard to believe a snowstorm could be close.
I want to go outside and lie in the sun... yet to our north, to our west, it is snowing and cold.
And it's moving...
...right here towards Colorado as we talk. It's incredible.
Hi, hon.
How's it going?
Fine.
Get a lot written today?
Yes.
Hey, the weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Come on, hon.
Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not...
...being grouchy-
I just want to finish my work.
Okay. I understand.
I'll come back later with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you'll let me read something then.
Wendy...
...let me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you're breaking my concentration.
You're distracting me...
...and it will then take me time to get back to where I was.
Understand?
Yeah.
Fine.
We're going to make a new rule:
Whenever I'm in here...
...and you hear me typing...
...or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...
...when I'm in here, that means I am working.
That means don't come in.
Now, do you think you can handle that?
Yeah.
Fine.
Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
OK.
All right, you!
I know you've got more.
Missed!
Don't have!
No fair anymore.
Oh, no.
I knew it.
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
Hi, how are you folks getting on up there? Over.
We're just fine.
But our telephones aren't doing too well.
Are the lines down, by any chance? Over.
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over.
Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over.
Well, I wouldn't like to say.
Most winters they stay that way until spring. Over.
Boy, this storm is really something, isn't it? Over.
Yes. It's one of the worst we've had for years.
Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
I suppose not. Over.
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
Okay. We'll do that.
It was real nice talking to you.
Bye. Over and out.
Hello, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...
...and ever...
...and ever.
Tony“.
...I'm scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn't real.
Please let me give you some money.
I wouldn't think of it.
Well, how can I repay you?
It's okay. Really.
Well, I'm going to have some coffee.
Would you like some?
Sure.
Great. Sit down.
Ooh, marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.
- Coffee will be ready--
Mom.
Yeah.
Can I go up to my room and get my fire engine?
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Now come on, Doc.
He only went to bed a few hours ago.
Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.
Well, all right.
But really don't make a sound.
I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back...
...because I'm going to make lunch soon.
- Okay?
- Okay, Mom.
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How's it going, Doc?
OK.
Having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I want you to have a good time. lam, Dad.
Dad?
Yes?
Do you feel bad?
No.
I'm just a little bit tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.
I got too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
Yes.
I do.
I love it.
Don't you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to like it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...
...and ever...
...and ever.
Dad?
What?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...
...in the whole world...
...and I would never do anything to hurt you...
...never.
You know that, don't you?
- Hm?
- Yes, Dad.
Good.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, are you in there?
Jack!
Jack? Jack!
Jack!
What happened?
Honey...
...what's wrong?
Jack?
I had the most...
...terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.
Really.
I dreamed that I...
...that I killed you and Danny.
But | didn't just kill you.
I cut you up into little pieces.
My God.
I must be losing my mind.
Everything's going to be all right.
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.
It's okay. There. Now sit up.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Danny!
Everything's okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad's just got a headache.
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.
Honey, let me just go get him out of here.
I'll be right back.
Danny.
Why don't you mind me?
Oh, Danny.
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
Danny, what happened to your neck?
Huh?
You did this to him...
...didn't you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn't you?!
How could you?!
How could you?!
Oh.
God! I'd give anything for a drink.
I'd give my goddamn soul...
...for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A little slow tonight, isn't it?
Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.
What Will it be?
I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd...
...because I just happen to have two twenties...
...and two tens right here in my wallet.
I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.
So here's what:
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...
...a little glass and some ice.
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?
You're not too busy, are you?
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.
Good man.
You set them up...
...and I'll knock them back, one by one.
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.
White man's burden. say, Lloyd...
...it seems I'm temporarily light.
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell.
I like you, Lloyd.
I always liked you.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender...
...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
Here's to five miserable months on the wagon...
...and all the irreparable harm that it's caused me.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better.
Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
No.
Nothing serious.
Just a little problem with...
...the old sperm bank upstairs.
Nothing I can't handle, though.
Thanks.
Women.
Can't live with them...
...can't live without them.
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.
Words of...
...wisdom.
I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it.
I didn't.
I wouldn't touch one hair on his goddamn little head.
I love the little son of a bitch.
I'd do anything for him.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As long as I live...
...she'll never let me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
It could have happened to anybody.
And it was three goddamn years ago!
The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor.
All I tried to do was pull him up.
A momentary loss of muscular coordination.
I mean...
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...
...per second, per second.
Jack!
Oh, Jack.
Thank God you're here.
Jack.
There's someone else in the hotel with us.
There's a crazy woman in one of the rooms.
She tried to strangle Danny.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
No.
It's the truth! Really.
I swear it. Danny told me.
He went up into one of the bedrooms.
The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub.
She tried to strangle him!
Which room was it?
From Channel 10 in Miami...
...this is Newswatch with Glenn Rinker...
...Ann Bishop, and the award-winning Newswatch team.
Good evening. I'm Glenn Rinker,
News-watch Ten.
As Miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave...
...bringing temperatures to the 90s...
...Central and Mountain states are buried in snow.
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell in just a few hours tonight.
Travel in the Rockies is almost impossible.
Airports are shut down, stranding thousands of passengers.
Highways are blocked by snowdrifts.
Railroad tracks are frozen.
Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch. ..
... at least three have been killed by exposure to freezing winds.
The governor of Colorado is expected...
...to declare a weather emergency.
The National Guard might be called out...
...to clear streets and roads.
Weather forecasters predict more snow...
...and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow...
...with temperatures dropping well below zero.
Back here in Florida, we've got the opposite problem.
The heat and humidity are supposed to climb.
Local beaches should be jammed.
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...
... will have the local forecast later on Newswatch.
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
If you need assistance, please call the operator.
Jack?
Yes, it's me.
Thank God.
Did you find anything?
No. Nothing at all.
I didn't see one goddamn thing.
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing.
How is he?
He's still asleep.
Good.
I'm sure he'll be himself again in the morning.
Are you sure it was the right room?
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.
He must have gone in that room.
The door was open, the lights were on.
I just don't understand it.
What about those bruises on his neck?
Somebody did that to him.
I think...
...he did it to himself.
No.
That's not possible.
Wendy...
...once you rule out his version of what happened...
...there is no other explanation.
Is there?
It wouldn't be that different from the episode...
...that he had before we came up here.
Would it?
Oh, Jack.
Whatever the explanation is...
... I think we...
...have to get Danny out of here.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
You mean...
...just leave the hotel?
Yes.
It is so...
...typical of you to create a problem like this...
...when I finally have a chance to accomplish something!
When I'm really into my work!
I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn't I?
Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash.
- Any of that appeal to you?
- Jack".
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far...
...but I am not going to let you fuck this up.
Good evening. Forest Service.
Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann.
I'm the head chef at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening.
What can I do for you?
I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there...
...but the operator said that the phone lines are down.
A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm.
I hate to put you through any trouble...
...but there's a family up there all by themselves with a young kid.
And with this storm and everything...
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give them a call on your radio...
...just to see if everything's okay.
I'll be glad to do that.
Why don't you call me back in about 20 minutes?
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.
All right, sir.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening.
Hi, Lloyd.
Been away, but now I'm back.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'|| it be, sir?
Hair of the dog that bit me.
Bourbon on the rocks.
That'll do her.
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.
No charge?
Your money's no good here.
Orders from the house.
Orders from the house.
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.
At least, not at this point.
Anything you say, Lloyd.
Anything you say.
Oh!
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I've made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.
Oh, that's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.
Advocaat, is it?
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...
...is to come along to the gentleman's room...
...and we'll get some water to it, sir.
Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself...
...Jeevesy old boy.
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.
Awfully nice of you to say.
Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening...
...before the fish and goose soiree.
Very wise, sir. Very wise.
Here. I'll just...
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Let's see if we can improve this with a little water, sir.
All right. I'll just...
...set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.
Won't keep you a moment.
Fine.
What do they call you, Jeevesy?
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
Uh....
Mr. Grady...
...haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.
It's coming off now, sir.
Uh...
...Mr. Grady...
...weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?
Yes, sir.
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.
And...
...where are they now?
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.
Mr. Grady.
You were the caretaker here.
I recognize you.
I saw your picture in the newspapers.
You...
...chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits.
And...
...then you blew your brains out.
That's strange, sir.
I don't have any recollection of that at all.
Mr. Grady...
...you were the caretaker here.
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.
But you...
...are the caretaker.
You've always been the caretaker.
I should know, sir.
I've always been here.
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...
...that your son...
...is attempting to bring an outside party...
...into this situation?
Did you know that?
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger?
A nigger...
.“cook.
How?
Your son...
...has a very great talent.
I don't think you are aware how great it is.
But he is attempting to use that very talent...
...against your will.
Well...
...he is a very willful boy.
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.
A very willful boy.
A rather...
...naughty boy...
...if I may be so bold, sir.
It's his mother.
She...
...interferes.
Perhaps they need a good...
...talking-to.
If...
...you don't mind my saying so.
Perhaps...
...a bit more.
My girls, sir...
...they didn't care for the Overlook at first.
One of them actually stole a pack of matches...
...and tried to burn it down.
But I...
...corrected them, sir.
And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty...
I--
...corrected her.
We have the Snowcat.
If the weather breaks...
...we might just be able...
...to get down the mountain.
I could call the forest rangers first...
...and...
...tell them that we're coming...
...so that...
...they could start searching for us in case we didn't make it.
And if Jack won't come with us...
...I'll just have to tell him that we're going by ourselves.
That's all there is to it.
Redrum.
Re drum.
Re drum. Redrum.
- Danny?
- Redrum.
Re drum. Redrum.
- Redrum.
- What's the matter, hon?
Re drum!
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny?
Hon?
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.
Come on, hon.
Wake up.
You just had a bad dream.
Everything's okay.
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.
Danny.
Wake up!
Come on.
Right now.
Wake up!
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.
Danny.

Good evening. Forest service.
This is Dick Hallorann again.
I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh, yeah.
We tried to contact them several times but they didn't answer.
Maybe they got their radio turned off or they can't hear it.
If you'd like, I'd be glad to try again later on.
That's very nice of you.
I'll call you back later.
Bye.
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.
Thank you very much.
Durkin's Garage.
Can I speak to Larry?
Speaking.
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.
Dick! How you doing?
How's the weather down there?
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.
What are you doing there?
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.
What's the weather like there?
The snowplows are keeping things moving in town...
...but the mountain roads are blocked.
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat to get up there.
Can you fix me up with one?
What's the big deal about getting there today...
“especially in this weather?
Larry, just between you and me, we got a very serious problem...
...with the people taking care of the place.
They turned out to be completely unreliable assholes.
Ullman phoned me last night.
And I'm supposed to find out if they have to be replaced.
How long will it take you to get here?
About five hours.
I'm going to rent a car here at the airport.
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.
That's all right. Drive carefully.
You're with Hal and Charlie on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.
And we have a bad day out there.
Heavy snow throughout the Denver metro area.
Many mountain passes...
Wolf Creek and Red Mountain passes are closed...
... and the chain law is in effect at the Eisenhower Tunnel.
We hear from the news department...
... only a few flights are landing at Stapleton Airport...
...and with storms like this...
...I guess the entire airport will be closed within the hour.
The storm will continue through the day and the Weather Service...
...has declared a stockman's and traveler's advisory...
...for all areas outlying the Denver metro region.
Get the cows in the barn.
Hon?
Listen to me for a minute, will you?
I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes...
...and I'll be right back.
I want you to just stay here...
...and watch your cartoons, okay?
Okay, hon?
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.
All right.
I'll-- I'll be back in just about five minutes.
I'm going to lock the door behind me.
Jack?
Jack?
How do you like it?
Jack.
How do you like it?
What are you doing down here?
I just...
...wanted...
...to talk to you.
OK.
Let's talk.
What do you want to talk about?
I--
I can't really remember.
You can't remember.
No...
...I can't.
Maybe it was about Danny?
Maybe it was about him.
I think we should discuss Danny.
I think...
...we should discuss what should be done with him.
What should be done with him?
I don't know.
I don't think that's true.
I think you have some very definite ideas...
...about what should be done with Danny.
And I'd like to know what they are.
Well, I...
...I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes.
When do you think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible?
"As soon as possible?"
Please.
You believe his health might be at stake.
Yes.
And you are concerned about him.
Yes.
And are you concerned about me?
Of course I am.
Of course you are!
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment's...
...thought about my responsibilities?
Have you ever thought for a single moment...
...about my responsibilities to my employers?!
Has it ever occurred to you...
...that I have agreed to look after the hotel until May 1st?
Does it matter to you at all...
...that the owners have placed their complete confidence in me...
...and that I have signed a letter of agreement...
...in which I've accepted that responsibility?
Do you have the slightest idea...
...what a moral and ethical principal is? Do you?!
Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future...
...if I fail to live up to my responsibilities?
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it'?!
Stay away from me!
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
Well...
...I'm very confused.
And I just need a chance to think things over.
You've had your whole fucking life to think things over!
What good's a few minutes more going to do you now?
Stay away from me!
Please!
Don't hurt me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
- Wendy.
- Stay away!
Darling.
Light of my life.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."
I'm just going to bash your brains in.
I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Please!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put that bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Please!
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.
Stop it!
- Give me the bat.
- Jack.
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.
Please stop!
Give me the bat.
- Stay away from me.
- Wendy.
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.
Ah! Goddamn--!
What are you doing?
Hey.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Uh! Oh!
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
Goddamn it!
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
Wendy, listen.
Let me out and I'll forget the whole goddamn thing.
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.
Wendy, baby.
I think you hurt my head real bad.
I'm dizzy.
I need a doctor.
Honey.
Don't leave me in here.
I'm going to go now.
I'm going to try...
...to get Danny down the Sidewinder...
...in the Snowcat today.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Wendy.
I'm going to go now.
Wendy.
Yes.
You've got a big surprise coming to you.
You're not going anywhere.
Go check out the Snowcat and the radio, and you'll see what I mean.
Go check it out.
Go check it out!
Go check it out.
Wendy?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Oh, Grady.
Grady, uh....
Hello, Grady.
Mr. Torrance...
...I see you can hardly have taken care of the...
...business we discussed.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.
I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?
I wonder.
I have my doubts.
I, and others, have come to believe...
...that your heart is not in this.
That you haven't the belly for it.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.
That's all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.
Somewhat more...
"resourceful.
She seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.
Only for the moment.
I fear you will have to deal with this matter...
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.
I fear...
...that is the only thing to do.
There's nothing I look forward to...
...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that, do you, Mr. Torrance?
I give you my word.

Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Danny...
...I can't get out.
Run!
Run and hide!
Run!
Quick!
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.
Not by the hair on your chinny-chin-chin?
Then I'll huff...
...and I'll puff...

Please!
Don't!

Where...?
How you doing, Keaton?
I can't feel my legs...
Keyser.
Ready?
What time is it?
It all started back in New York six weeks ago.
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.
The driver didn't see anyone, but someone fucked up.
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.
- Mr. McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.
Todd Hockney?
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.
- Shit.
- Freeze!
Hold it!
Sure you brought enough guys?
It's quite simple, really.
A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.
In other words... the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.
- Let me give you an example-
- This I had to see for myself.
David.
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.
Everyone, this is David Kujan.
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.
These gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.
A small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.
Mr. Keaton?
Will you excuse us for a moment?
We have some questions to ask you downtown. 
You'll be a while.
No. Please, sit down.
This is a small problem.
Enjoy the meal. 
I'll talk to you later.
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.
These guys were hard-core hijackers...
but there I was.
At that point, I wasn't scared.
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.
Besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.
You all know the drill.
When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.
Number 1, step forward.
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."
Number 2, step forward.
Gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker. "
- In English, please.
- Excuse me?
- In English.
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?
Number 4, step forward.
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."
It was the cops' fault.
You don't put guys like that into a room together.
Who knows what can happen?
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."
This has really got to be embarrassing for you guys.
They drilled us all night.
Someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing.
They were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something.
They knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us.
They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. Disgraceful.
They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.
What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.
Wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?
- Say who?
- McManus.
He told us another story.
Is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.
But when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man.
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?
Hello?
I want my lawyer.
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.
Without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.
You guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on.
You think so, tough guy?
I can put you in Queens during the hijacking.
Really?
I live in Queens.
Did you put that together yourself, Einstein?
You got a team of monkeys working full time on this?
You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?
I fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack.
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.
But Keaton?
Keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons.
It was your mistake, not mine.
Did you ever stop to ask me?
I've been walking around with the same face, the same name.
I'm a businessman.
What's that? The restaurant business?
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.
Like I said... it was your mistake... not mine.
You charge me with this shit... and I'll beat it.
Okay?
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.
Really, somebody's got to do something about this shit.
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.
Does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone?
Fuck 'em.
Fenster, will you relax?
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.
They treat me like a criminal.
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.
Why'd you got to go and do that?
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?
You're making me tired all over.
Fuck it then.
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.
- What's that all about?
- What's this?
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
Who's that?
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
How 'bout it, Keaton?
You a lawyer's wife?
What kind of retainer you giving her?
Do your friend a favor... tell him to keep quiet.
Dean Keaton...
Gone clean?
Say it ain't so.
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?
This whole thing was a shakedown.
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?
It's always you and four dummies.
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.
There's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.
- What's a voice lineup?
- Public defender could get you out of that.
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.
A truckload of guns gets snagged.
Customs comes down on NYPD for answers. 
They come up with us.
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.
Is it Friday already?
Yeah, lover boy.
You want a piece? Jump in. 
I'll love you.
So who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck?
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?
His name is Verbal.
Verbal Kint.
- Verbal?
- Yeah.
Roger, really. 
People say I talk too much.
I was going to tell you to shut up.
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?
I walked. 90 days, suspended.
- So you did it.
- All right, now look... we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.
Now, me and Fenster heard about a little job.
Why don't you just calm down?
What do you care what he has to say?
I'm just talking here.
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants to hear it... and I know Fenster's down.
What about you, guy?
I'm interested.
There. See?
I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.
Why don't you just shut up?
You're missing the point.
No.
You're missing the point.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I don't care about your job.
And...
I want nothing to do with any of you.
I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell.
Dean Keaton... gone the high road.
What is the world coming to?
Fuck him.
And that was how it started:
The five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge...
to be leaned on by half-wits.
I really can't talk about it much here.
What the cops never figured out, and what I know now...
was that these men would never break, never lie down.
Never bend over for anybody.
Anybody.
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.
They're still pulling bodies out of the water.
- Any survivors?
- Two.
One guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma.
The DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York.
The chief wants this place sealed off.
If you have any questions, give him a call.
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department...
at extension 112. Have a nice day.
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you... the DA came down here last night ready to arraign... even before they moved him to County.
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later... the DA comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around.
They take his statement, and they cut him a deal.
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.
What is that?
I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?
Excuse me, sir.
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.
The chief. 
This morning, the governor called, okay?
I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.
- No.
- I gotta see him.
- No. I can't-
- You gotta do this for me.
I came a long way for this.
Dave, please.
Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.
He's paranoid about being recorded.
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.
This won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.
Where?
No, no.
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.
But there's a lot more to his story, believe me.
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier... for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.
He's dead.
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.
They're all dead.
I don't care how tough you say Keaton was... nobody on that boat could've come out alive.
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.
Burn victims are very susceptible to infection.
And, of course, there's no smoking.
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.
Is he gonna die?
He's burned 60 percent of his body, broken ribs-
Call security. Put a man on the door.
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.
Do it.
Do it now!
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.
Yes, I'm sure.
No, he's all fucked up.
I can't hear you.
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.
Yes.
No, not till I put a man on him.
Send me someone who can speak Hungarian.
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.
Keyser Soze.
- What?
- Keyser Soze!
No shit?
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice... and find Dave Kujan from Customs.
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.
Nice to meet you.
He wants to ask you a few questions before you go.
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.
I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.
Once I got so bad my piss come out like snot.
- It was all thick and gooey-
- I'll get your fucking coffee.
Get me one, too, while you're at it.
That guy is tense.
Tension is a killer.
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
The baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning-
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.
I would've liked to have been a fed, but my CP-
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.
I told the DA everything I know.
I know you like Keaton.
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.
He was a corrupt cop.
Sure. 15 years ago, but he was a good thief.
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.
May I have a cigarette?
- According to your statement-
- I need a light.
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator... run-of-the-mill-
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator... run-of-the-mill scams.
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.
He's a good friend of mine, likes me very much.
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.
He's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him.
What would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.
Say you arrest three guys for the same killing.
Put them in jail overnight.
Next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man.
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.
- You follow me?
- No.
Let me get to the point.
I'm smarter than you, and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.
I'm not a rat.
Thanks.
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
Right off the trees, I mean. 
That was good.
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?
What happened after the lineup?
The desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you.
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.
Damn police.
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.
I'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
What did Fortier and Renault say?
They asked for more time to think about investing.
Damn it.
More time for what?
No matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me.
Give me some credit.
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't-
- It's never going to stop, period.
By next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us.
It's finished.
I'm finished.
Don't give up on me now.
It's never gonna stop.
I love you.
They ruined me in there tonight.
I love you.
Do you hear me?
What?
All right.
Let's just go to my place.
We'll worry about this tomorrow.
Let's go.
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition:
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.
We all knew it could be done.
The way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing.
To do it right took five men.
Five men meant Keaton.
Keaton took convincing.
New York's finest taxi service.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
They don't operate anymore.
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.
They're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from South America.
McManus already has a fence set up.
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.
They won't take me unless you go.
Look at me. I need this.
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?
I'm not knocking you. 
You got a good scam going with this lawyer.
Sorry.
It's okay.
You say it's the real thing? 
That's cool.
You okay?
I was out of line.
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.
As clean as you get, they'll never let you go now.
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime.
You sure you're okay?
I'll be all right.
Look, I...
- sometimes get-
- Forget it.
I'll probably shit blood tonight.
So... how do they wanna do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.
Fenster? Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.
But like I say, they won't let me in without you.
$3 million?
Maybe more.
No killing.
Not if we do it my way.
New York's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service.
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket...
driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.
For $300 a mile, you got your own blue and white...
and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.
After a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down.
Ever since then, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.
That's where we came in.
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.
Will this get me to Staten Island?
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.
McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.
Hockney supplied the hardware.
I came through with how to do it so no one got killed.
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.
A little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.
Watch this.
Careful.
Come on, asshole!
Holy shit!
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!
Drop the fuckin' gun! 
Drop it!
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.
We're cops! Stupid assholes!
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!
Fuck.
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!
Give him the fuckin' thing!
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!
Hurry up! Come on!
- Now the money!
- There's no money.
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money!
Give him the fuckin' money!
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!
You know who the fuck I am?
You people know who the fuck I am? 
Fuck!
We do now, jerk-off.
Cocksucker.
Wait a minute. What's that?
What the fuck?
Holy shit!
Go!
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
The press was on the scene before the police were.
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.
Everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down.
It was beautiful.
I owe you $2.50.
Dr. Keaton.
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.
In California?
Yes, Verbal, in California. 
Fenster and I-
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?
We all go.
What's your fuckin' problem, man?
My problem, is you and Fenster honeymooning in California... while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks.
The job's over.
Cool it.
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.
You wanna dance?
Ladies.
I would like to propose a toast.
There you go.
To Mr. Verbal... the man with the plan.
We're gonna miss the flight.
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.
I said we'll make it.
We're gonna miss the plane.
She'll understand.
That's heartwarming. 
Really.
I'm weepy.
You wanna wait outside?
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.
Come on, Verbal.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?
For a woman?
Bullshit. 
Keaton was using her.
- He loved her.
- Sure.
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea.
- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.
Who else would know better?
- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.
Let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.
I've been investigating him for the past three years.
The guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.
IAD indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.
Don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.
You got him all wrong.
Do I?
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.
In every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony... or died before they could testify.
When they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing.
He killed three prisoners inside.
Of course, I can't prove this... but I can't prove the best part either.
Dean Keaton was dead.
Did you know that?
He died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder... of a witness who was going to testify against him.
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned... just before it blew up.
They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.
Within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.
One killed himself in his car.
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.
Let's get this show on the road.
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many-
I promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light.
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.
Everyone calm down, all right?
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.
- He says they were buying-
- Dope. We know.
He doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope.
- People.
- What?
He needs guarantees...
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.
He saw the Devil.
Looked him in the eye.
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.
Ask him to tell him what he told me... about the Devil.
Who's the Devil?
Keyser Soze.
Keyser Soze?
He was in the harbor, killing many men.
He saw Keyser Soze?
- He saw his face.
- All right.
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.
Describe him.
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...
telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's, and there he is.
Because he never profited from his alleged death... and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him... we had to let him go.
He was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over.
And then he had lunch.
I don't know about that.
I don't think you do, but you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there.
I think he's behind that circus at the harbor.
My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend.
You tell me he's dead, so be it.
I wanna be sure before I go back to New York.
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.
What lawyer?
What lawyer?
Back when I was in that barbershop quartet-
You don't think I know you held out on the DA?
What did you leave out?
I could be on the phone to Ruby in 10 minutes.
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.
You get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.
Every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor... every creep and scumbag that walks the street... will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me... or that precious immunity they grant you... won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.
There was a lawyer.
Kobayashi.
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.
Convince me.
Tell me every last detail.
We arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.
- Still, we should have known better.
- How you doing?
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.
How's it going, Fenster?
Don't need to open it, right?
You must be Keaton.
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.
You interested in more work?
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.
That's too bad.
I got a ton of work and no good people.
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?
There's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.
The word is, he carries around a lot of cash.
So I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green.
- Simple.
- What about security?
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.
Give me time to check it out?
I expect nothing less from you, man.
Good to see you. We'll call you.
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.
A friend in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.
The way I hear it, you did time with ol' Spook.
A good man, wasn't he?
I used to run dope for him.
Too bad he got shivved.
I shivved him.
Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.
I appreciate that.
But just out of curiosity... was it business or personal?
A bit of both.
Like I said... you give me a call if you're interested.
Is there a problem?
One job.
That was the deal.
One job?
One job?
That's a good one.
Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.
He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.
It took one day with McManus nagging, and we went back to work.
I get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked.
I look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked.
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!
There's a second one here, somewhere.
Gimme the case. 
Give me the fuckin' case!
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.
Give me the fuckin' case!
- Come on!
- Don't move!
Hand over the case.
Hand over the fuckin' case.
Come on, let's go!
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.
Let's go!
Fuck.
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.
Guys, come on.
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.
What am I supposed to do with that?
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
Who?
I don't know. Some limey.
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.
We wanna meet him, okay?
That's funny.
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.
Okay, we'll meet him.
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?
Get the fuck off my dick.
No!
Put a leash on that puppy.
It's an awful shame about Saul gettin' whacked.
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.
Sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me.
You have a sweet night, ladies.
Fuck you.
- So this lawyer-
- Kobayashi.
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the DA?
Dave, someone to see you.
I've been looking all over for you.
You still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday?
You can stop looking. 
There was no coke.
I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe... yesterday after the shootout.
He came to this morning, he started talking.
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.
- But there were-
- We know. But he says no on the dope.
This Hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.
They had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it.
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.
No one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.
They were all very hush about it, he says.
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.
You got the cripple in there from New York?
Did he mention Keyser Soze?
Who?
Just bear with me here.
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!
We've been goin' over this for an hour and a half.
What we need to do is find Redfoot and get the hell out of here now.
What we need to do is think.
Think back.
Somebody with power... somebody capable of tracking us from New York to LA.
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.
Mr. Hockney, do stay.
Mr. Keaton.
Mr. Fenster I recognize from his mug shots... as well as Mr. McManus.
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.
My employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit.
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.
One job, one day's work. 
Very dangerous.
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do... will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.
Who's your boss?
I work for Keyser Soze.
Who's Keyser Soze?
Judging by the sudden change in mood...
I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.
I come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze.
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.
The cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr. Soze... and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.
A most profitable violation of UN Regulations.
You had no way of knowing this... because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Soze... without his knowledge.
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus... hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.
The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.
Two months ago,
Mr. Hockney stole a truck... carrying gun parts through Queens.
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.
They were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's... less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam... by a cripple.
He was relieved of $62,000.
Now, it has taken us some time to find you.
Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.
You set up the lineup.
Yes. You were not to be released until I had come to see you.
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran... was a little too effective in expediting his release.
Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people for long... and they never know who they're working for.
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
So, why are you telling us?
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster.
All of you.
That you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive.
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?
I don't think that is very relevant.
All five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg... and his bodyguards.
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement.
We can see to it that he will.
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:
Mr. Soze's primary interest... is narcotics.
He has been competing, shall we say... with a group of Argentineans for several years.
Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale... of $91 million in cocaine in three days time.
Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize... the diminishing strength of their organization.
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.
If you choose, you may wait until after the buy.
Whatever money changes hands is yours.
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.
And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
A gift from Mr. Soze.
Good day, gentlemen.
They got my whole life in here, everything I've done since I was 18.
They fuckin' know everything.
Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.
No.
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.
Who's that guy who used to talk about Soze in New York?
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.
He said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.
This guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.
I don't know. 
This is bad.
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!
Who is Keyser Soze?
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.
Nobody ever believed he was real.
Nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him.
To hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze.
You never knew. 
That was his power.
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled... was convincing the world he didn't exist.
One story the guys told me, the story I believe... was from his days in Turkey.
There was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.
They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns... or money or even numbers.
You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.
After a while they come into power, and then they come after Soze.
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.
They come to his home...
in the afternoon looking for his business.
They find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for Soze.
He comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.
They let him know they meant business.
No!
They tell him they want his territory, all his business.
Soze looks over the faces of his family.
Then he showed these men of will what will really was.
He tells them he would rather see his family dead...
than live another day after this.
He lets the last Hungarian go... waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob.
He kills their kids, he kills their wives... he kills their parents and their friends.
He burns down the houses they live in...
and the stores they work in.
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that... he's gone, underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.
A spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.
"Rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you."
No one ever really believes.
Do you believe in him?
Keaton always said:
"I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."
I believe in God.
And the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.
You give any weight to this?
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.
You've heard of him?
Where? On the street?
A few times. 
You know, outside stuff.
Someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from Soze.
Shit like that.
It could be an old badge. 
A hex sign.
Keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something.
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of Soze.
I'll run it up the flagpole.
I came clean. 
I told it like it happened.
So what about how I got there?
It's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.
If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?
If there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you.
Where's your head?
Where do you think the pressure is?
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him, knows where I am right now.
He has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.
Immunity was just a deal with you assholes.
I got a new problem when I post bail.
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.
The same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?
Fuck you.
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?
You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught... and sticks his head out?
If he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.
After that... my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
What happened next?
We woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.
He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.
He left us a note wishing us good luck... and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.
Then what?
McManus was furious.
He talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.
That night, we got the call.
What call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
We gotta bury him.
With what?
With our hands.
This is nuts.
It's dry fucking sand.
When he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.
I don't know about you, peg leg, but I can run. I got no problem with that.
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.
You run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you.
You got that?
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.
We did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count.
So fuck you!
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!
It's precaution.
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.
I'm not doin' it for you.
I'm doin' this for me.
I'm gonna finish this thing.
This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.
After they killed Fenster, nobody would run?
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?
Believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
It was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy. 
An ex-cop.
To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated.
It's always simple.
There's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal.
You got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right.
Nobody argued with Keaton.
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.
They're coming up.
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.
Don't move.
Press 20. Do it now.
Move.
- The answer is "no."
- Mr. Soze will be most-
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze.
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.
A strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.
We know that you can get to us... but now you know that we can get to you.
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.
My employer has made up his mind.
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.
You got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.
Not before one of us gets through to you.
I believe you. 
I most sincerely do.
You would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is... ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me... if I do not carry out my orders in full.
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm so sorry.
I implore you, believe me...
Mr. Soze is very real...
- and very determined.
- We'll see.
Before you do me in... you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?
What did you say?
Edie Finneran.
She's upstairs in my office... for an extradition deposition.
I requested she be put on the case personally.
She flew in yesterday.
No matter.
Kill away.
You're lying.
Am I?
Miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.
Never leaves her for a moment.
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.
If I see you or any of your friends before then...
Miss Finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies.
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney... and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr. Kint.
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.
Do I make myself clear?
We will take care of the two bodies downstairs.
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
It's a logistical nightmare.
Close quarters. 
10, maybe 20 men.
There's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck.
Can we stealth these guys?
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.
Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.
What if we wait for the money?
Ten more men at least.
In my opinion, it can't be done.
Anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive.
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.
Me, too.
There's nothing that can't be done.
I just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death.
The news said it's raining in New York.
What language is that?
I don't know. Russian, I think.
Hungarian?
The package has arrived, gentlemen.
You kids ready?
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.
I'm ready.
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.
I'm ready.
I want you to stay here.
I'm supposed to cover-
If we don't get out of this, take the money and go.
I can't-
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.
She knows people. 
She knows what to do.
If I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
- What if I-
- Just do what I say.
Please.
Tell her that...
Tell her I tried.
McManus, he's on his way.
I'm there.
One, two, three, four... five, six, seven...
Oswald was a fag.
Hi.
How you doin'?
Is there a problem?
Now.
"Old McDonald had a farm
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"
Elvis has left the building.
No dispares. No dispares. 
Vamonos!
Hello.
Why didn't you run?
I froze up.
I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.
Then I thought about Keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off.
A boy found a body on the beach today.
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.
A petty smuggler from Argentina.
He was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.
They're setting up extradition, he escapes again.
Now, get this.
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.
Kobayashi.
New York faxed me a copy of his testimony.
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.
Arturo was very opposed to returning to prison.
So much so, that he named close to 50 people.
Guess who he named in the finale.
Keyser Soze.
There's more.
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.
There was no dope on that boat.
You, stay quiet.
He's here.
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.
I know he's here!
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.
There's no coke.
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?
I've been up and down in every fucking room.
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!
Nothing!
Don't you fuck with me.
There is no fucking coke!
I'm out of here.
I told them nothing.
I swear.
I told them nothing. 
Please.
What the fuck is goin' on?
The strangest thing.
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.
I got immunity. 
I don't have to take this.
You know what I'm getting at.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!
Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
I did.
You're lying to me.
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot. 
I swear to you.
Why didn't you help him? 
You had a gun.
He was your friend.
Because I was afraid.
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid of-
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.
It was Keyser Soze, I mean, the Devil himself.
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
What if you miss?
Let's get back to the pier.
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.
He swore out a statement to federal marshals... saying that he had seen and could positively identify one...
Keyser Soze.
It says right here in the report.
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including... but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.
Most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.
The money wasn't there for dope.
The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy...
that could incriminate Keyser Soze.
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.
She knew who he was and what he knew.
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.
A suicide mission to whack out the one guy...
that could finger Keyser Soze.
So Soze put some thieves to it...
men he knew he could march into certain death.
You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?
I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.
Just do what I tell you.
If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere... why did he give you the money to run?
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.
A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world...
finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?
No, sir. Why?
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.
Even if I did...
I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her.
So why?
Because he was my friend.
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.
What are you doing here?
He saved you because he wanted it that way.
It was his will.
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.
A man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
A man who could engineer a police lineup...
through all his years of contacts in NYPD.
The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.
She was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania... shot twice in the head.
What do you think about Keaton now?
Edie?
He used all of you to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself... to make sure he got his man... the one man that could identify him.
This is all bullshit.
You said you saw him die.
Or did you?
You had to hide when you heard the police cars.
You said you heard the shot before the fire... but you didn't see him die.
- I knew him. He would never-
- He programmed you.
He programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to.
He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.
Where was the political pressure to protect you from?
It was Keaton.
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?
Because you're a cripple.
Because you're stupid.
Because you're weaker than them.
If he's dead...
If what you say is true, then it won't matter.
It was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it?
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.
We followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know.
I saw him die.
I believe he's dead. 
Christ.
You're not safe on your own.
You think he's...
Keyser Soze?
I don't know.
Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story.
But I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you.
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.
You posted 20 minutes ago.
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.
If someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there.
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.
Maybe so.
But I'm not a rat.
Fuckin' cops.
Can I use your fax machine?
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.
One watch, gold.
One cigarette lighter, gold.
One pack of cigarettes. 
Thank you.
We still got nothing.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Which is nothing.
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...
if Keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again.
I'll find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Nothing.
Man, you're a slob.
But it all has a system.
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.
Convince me. Tell me every last...
When I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...
- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.
- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.
- A gift from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me.
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.
There was a lawyer...
Kobayashi...
When I was picking beans in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.
- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
This guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of...
What's your story, pretzel man?
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.
- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.
Every creep and scumbag that works the street...
will know the name of Verbal Kint.
The cripple, did you see him?
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...
I'm smarter than you...
and I'm gonna find out whether you like it or not.
To a cop, the explanation is never complicated.
- It's always simple.
- The truth!
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.
Somebody with power, somebody who is capable...
Keyser Soze!
You think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught...
and sticks his head out?
Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?
You've known the whole fuckin' time!
If he comes up for anything it'll be for me. 
I'm sure Keaton is dead.
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.
First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?
- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?
After that...
my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...
was convincing the world he didn't exist.
And like that...
he's gone.
Rosebud.
News on the March.
Legendary was the Xanadu...
...where Kubla Khan decreed his stately pleasure dome.
Today almost as legendary as Florida's Xanadu...
...the world's largest private pleasure ground.
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast.
A private mountain...
...was commissioned and successfully built.
One hundred thousand trees.
Twenty thousand tons of marble...
...are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
Contents of Xanadu's palace:
Paintings. Pictures. Statues.
Various stones of other palaces.
A collection of everything.
So big it can never be catalogued or appraised.
 Enough for 10 museums.
The loot of the world.
Xanadu's livestock...
...the fowl of the air. The fish of the sea.
The beast of the field and jungle...
...two of each.
The biggest private zoo since Noah.
Like the Pharaohs...
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones to mark his grave.
Since the Pyramids...
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...
...a man has built to himself.
Here in Xanadu last week...
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.
A potent figure of our century...
...America's Kubla Khan:
Charles Foster Kane.
Its humble beginnings.
In this ramshackle building. A dying daily.
Kane's empire. In its glory...
...held dominion over 37 newspapers.
Two syndicates...
...a radio network.
An empire upon an empire.
The first of grocery stores. Paper mills...
...apartment buildings.
Factories. Forests. Ocean liners.
An empire through which for 50 years...
...flowed in an unending stream...
...the wealth of the Earth's third richest gold mine.
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune.
How. To boarding housekeeper Mary Kane.
By a defaulting boarder. In 1868...
...was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mineshaft:
The Colorado Lode.
Fifty-seven years later.
Before a congressional investigation...
...Walter P. Thatcher.
Grand old man of Wall Street...
...for years chief target of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...
...recalls a journey he made as a youth.
My firm had been appointed trustee by Mrs. Kane...
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.
It was her wish that I take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...
...personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
I shall read to the committee a prepared statement...
...which I have brought with me, and then refuse to answer questions.
Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs...
...and by the dangerous manner he has persistently attacked...
...American traditions of private property...
...initiative and opportunity for advancement...
...is, in fact, nothing more or less than a communist.
That same month in Union Square...
The words "Charles Foster Kane"...
...are a menace to every workingman in this land.
He is today what he has always been and always will be: A fascist.
And still another opinion...
Kane urged his country's entry into one war...
...opposed participation in another.
Won the election to one American president at least.
Spoke for millions of Americans.
Was hated by as many more.
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...
...no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand.
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce.
Often support. Then denounce.
Twice married. Twice divorced.
First to a president's niece...
...Emily Norton. Who left him in 1916.
Died 1918 in a motor accident with their son.
Sixteen years after his first marriage...
...two weeks after his first divorce...
...Kane married Susan Alexander...
...singer. At the Town Hall in Trenton. New Jersey.
For wife two.
One-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...
...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.
Cost: $3 million.
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane.
Half-finished before she divorced him...
...the still unfinished...
...Xanadu.
Cost: No man can say.
Kane. Molder of mass opinion though he was...
...in all his life was never granted elective office...
...by the voters of his country.
But Kane papers were once strong indeed...
...and once the prize seemed almost his.
In 1916. as independent candidate for governor...
...the best elements of the state behind him...
...the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career...
...then suddenly. Less than one week before election...
...defeat.
Shameful. Ignominious.
Defeat that set back for 20 years the cause of reform in the U. S...
...forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane.
Then. In the first year of the Great Depression...
...a Kane paper closes.
For Kane. In four short years. Collapse.
Eleven Kane papers merged.
More sold. Scrapped.
Is that correct?
Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.
- Read the Inquirer.
- How were business conditions in Europe?
How did I find business conditions in Europe, Mr. Bones?
With great difficulty.
Are you glad to be back?
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.
Always been an American. Anything else?
When I was a reporter, we asked them quicker than that.
What do you think of the chances for war in Europe?
I talked with the responsible leaders of England, France, Germany and Italy.
They're too intelligent to embark on a project...
...that would mean the end of civilization.
You can take my word for it, there will be no war.
Kane helped to change the world...
...but Kane's world now is history...
...and the great yellow journalist himself lived to be history...
...outlived his power to make it.
Alone in his never-finished.
Already decaying pleasure palace...
...aloof. Seldom visited.
Never photographed...
...an emperor of newsprint continued to direct his failing empire.
Vainly attempted to sway. As he once did...
...the destinies of a nation that had ceased to listen to him...
...ceased to trust him.
Then last week. As it must to all men...
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.
News on the March.
That's it.
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.
- How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
- How do you like it, boys?
- Seventy years in a man's life.
- That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.
It's a good short, but what it needs is an angle.
All we saw on that screen was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.
I know that. I read the papers.
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...
...you've got to tell us who he was.
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?
Do you remember, boys?
What were the last words he said on Earth?
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed.
- Maybe he didn't.
- All we saw was a big American.
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?
I tell you, a man's dying words...
What were they?
You don't read the papers.
When Charles Foster Kane died, he said one word:
"Rosebud. "
That's all he said? Tough guy.
Yes, "Rosebud. " Just that one word.
- But who is she?
- What was it?
Here's a man who could've been president...
...who was as loved, hated and talked about...
...as any man in our time, but when he dies...
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.
- What does that mean?
- A racehorse he bet on once.
- That didn't come in.
- But what was the race?
Rosebud.
- Thompson.
- Yes.
Hold this up a week, two if you must.
Don't you think right after he's dead...
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch with anybody who knew him...
...or knew him well.
That manager of his...
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.
Susan Alexander Kane.
- She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
- That's right.
See them all. Get in touch with everybody that ever worked for him...
...whoever loved him, whoever hated his guts.
I don't mean go through the city directory of course.
I'll get on it right away.
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.
It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing.
Miss Alexander.
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
I want another drink, John.
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
- I'll have a highball, please.
- Who told you you could sit down?
I thought maybe we could have a talk.
Think again.
Can't you people leave me alone?
I'm minding my own business, you mind yours.
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd...
Get out of here.
Get out!
- Sorry.
- Get out.
- Maybe some other time.
- Get out.
Gino.
Get her another highball.
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.
Okay.
- Another double?
- Yeah.
Hello, I want New York City.
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.
She's...
She'll snap out of it.
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as any...
- Hello.
- Sooner.
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.
I'm calling from Atlantic City.
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia, to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.
They're expecting me.
Then I've a meeting with his general manager in New York. Bernstein.
Then I'm coming back here.
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.
- Hey...
- John.
You just might be able to help me.
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane, did she ever mention Rosebud?
"Rosebud"?
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.
As a matter of fact, just the other day, when the papers were full of it...
...I asked her.
She never heard of Rosebud.
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...
...about the conditions under which you may...
...inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.
- I remember them.
- Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.
- All I want is an hour...
- Under no circumstances...
...are direct quotes from his manuscript to be used by you. You may follow me.
That's all right. I'm just looking for...
Jennings.
Thank you, Jennings.
You will be required to leave this room at 4:30 promptly.
You will confine yourself, it is our understanding...
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.
That's all I'm interested in.
Thank you.
Pages 83 to 142.
Come on, boys.
Be careful, Charles.
Mrs. Kane.
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...
...just 'cause we came into money.
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.
A boarder that beats his bill and leaves worthless stock behind...
That property is as much my property as anybody's...
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...
...this would happen, he'd have made out the certificates in both our names.
- But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
- He owed the money to both of us.
- "The bank's decision in all matters... "
- I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...
- Stop this nonsense.
- We're a bit uneducated...
"The bank's decision concerning his education...
"... his places of residence, is to be final. "
- The idea of a bank being the guardian...
- Stop this nonsense, Jim.
"We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode"...
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane, you are the sole owner.
- Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
- Right here.
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.
You'd think I hadn't been a good husband or father...
The sum of $50,000 a year...
...is to be paid to you and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...
...and thereafter to the survivor.
- Let's hope it's all for the best.
- It is.
Why I can't raise my own boy is more than I can understand.
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
Everything else, the principal, as well as all monies earned...
...is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane...
...until he reaches his 25th birthday, at which time...
...he is to come into complete possession.
Charles!
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?
I've got his trunk all packed.
I've had it packed for a week now.
I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago.
I'd have brought him here with me, but...
- Charles.
- Look, Mom.
You'd better come inside.
- That's quite a snowman.
- I took the pipe out of his mouth.
Did you make it yourself?
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
- Hello.
- How do you do, Charles?
He comes from the East.
- Pa.
- Hello, Charlie.
Charles.
Yes, Mommy.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight.
You'll be leaving on number 10.
That's the train with all the lights on it.
You going, Mom?
No. Your mother won't be going right away, but she'll...
Where am I going?
You're going to see Chicago and New York and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?
He certainly is.
I wish I were a boy going on a trip like that for the first time.
- Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
- We have to stay here, Charles.
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie.
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures, well, that is...
...me and her decided this ain't the place for you to grow up in.
You'll probably be the richest man someday...
...and you ought to get...
- You won't be lonely.
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have fine times together, we are.
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am I?
- What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.
- Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie!
Sleds aren't to hit people, but to sleigh with.
Mom!
- You got to go.
- Jim!
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.
That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.
Well, Charles...
...Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
And a happy New Year.
In closing...
...may I remind you your 25th birthday, which is now approaching...
...marks your complete independence from the firm...
...of Thatcher & Company, as well as acquiring the full responsibility...
...for the world's sixth largest private fortune.
- Got that?
- "The world's sixth largest private fortune. "
I don't think you realize the full importance of the position you are to occupy.
I am therefore enclosing for your consideration...
...a list of your holdings, extensively cross-indexed.
- "Dear Mr. Thatcher. "
- It's from Mr. Kane.
- Go on.
- "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...
"... oil wells, shipping or real estate. "
Not interested?
"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.
"A little newspaper we acquired in a foreclosure proceeding.
"Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.
"I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.
"I think it would be fun to run a newspaper. "
"Traction Trust exposed. "
"Traction Trust bleeds public white. "
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer. "
"Landlords refuse to clear slums. "
"Inquirer wins slum fight. "
"Wall Street backs copper swindle. "
"Copper robbers indicted. "
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast. "
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.
You know there's not the slightest proof this...
...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
- Hello, Mr. Bernstein.
Can you prove it isn't?
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.
- Mr. Leland.
- Hello.
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.
He knows what's wrong with every copy of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...
"... about scenery but don't feel right spending your money. Stop.
"There is no war in Cuba. "
Signed "Wheeler. " Any answer?
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide the prose poems, I'll provide the war.
- That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.
I came to see you about this campaign of yours.
The Inquirer's campaign against the Public Transit Company.
Do you know anything we can use against them?
You're still the college boy, eh?
I was expelled from college, a lot of colleges, you remember? I remember.
I think I should remind you of a fact you have forgotten.
You're one of the largest stockholders in the Public Transit Company.
The trouble is, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares...
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...
...his paper should be closed, a committee formed to boycott him.
If you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of $1,000.
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...
...to see that the working people of this community aren't robbed by a pack...
...of money-mad pirates, just because...
...they have no one to look after their interests.
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.
If I don't look after the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will.
Maybe somebody without money or property.
That would be too bad.
I saw your financial statement today.
- Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...
...don't you think it's rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise...
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.
I expect to lose $1 million next year.
At the rate of $1 million a year...
...I'll have to close this place in 60 years.
"With respect to the said newspapers...
"... the said Charles Foster Kane...
"... hereby relinquishes all control thereof...
"... and of the syndicates pertaining thereto...
"... and any and all other newspaper, press and publishing properties of any kind...
"... and agrees to abandon all claim thereto... "
- Which means we're bust all right.
- Well, out of cash.
All right, Mr. Bernstein.
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher, just let me sign it and go home.
You're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
You're too old to be called anything else.
You were always too old.
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...
"... to pay to Charles Foster Kane, as long as he lives... "
My allowance.
"You will continue to maintain over your newspapers a large...
"... measure of control.
Measure of control. "
And we shall seek your advice.
This depression is temporary.
There's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will.
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.
We never lost as much as we made.
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to...
To buy things.
To buy things.
My mother should have chosen a less reliable banker.
I always gagged on that silver spoon.
You know, Mr. Bernstein...
...if I hadn't been very rich...
...I might have been a really great man.
Don't you think you are?
I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.
What would you like to have been?
Everything you hate.
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?
- It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man.
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.
- You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings, isn't it?
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?
We thought maybe... If we could find out what he meant by his last words...
...as he was dying.
- That "Rosebud"?
Maybe some girl?
There were a lot of them in the early days.
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane could have met someone casually...
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed...
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.
A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember.
You take me.
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...
...and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in...
...and on it there was a girl waiting to get off.
A white dress she had on.
She was carrying a white parasol.
I only saw her for one second.
She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...
...that I haven't thought of that girl.
- Who else have you been to see?
- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.
Susie?
Thank you.
I called her myself the day after he died.
I thought maybe somebody ought to.
- She couldn't even come to the phone.
- I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.
If you'd talk about anything connected with Mr. Kane that you can remember.
You were with him from the beginning.
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie?
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've been through Walter Thatcher's journal.
- That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.
Harvard?
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.
One of those families where the father is worth $10 million...
...then one day he shoots himself, and it turns out there's nothing but debts.
He was with Mr. Kane and me...
...the first day Mr. Kane took over the Inquirer.
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.
It's going to look a lot different one of these days. Come on.
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.
You're getting paid, mister, for opinions or for hauling?
- Jedediah.
- After you, Mr. Kane.
Excuse me, sir, but I...
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.
- Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland...
- How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.
- It is dramatic critic, right?
- That's right.
- Are they standing for me?
- You? Oh, Mr. Kane.
Standing?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.
- Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
- The new publisher.
- You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- I didn't know your plans.
- I don't know my plans myself.
- Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
- No?
Except to get out a newspaper.
- Mr. Bernstein.
- Yes, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
- Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
- How do you do, Mr. Carter?
- Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?
- Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
- Stein.
- Kane.
- Mr. Carter, is this your office?
My little private sanctum is at your disposal.
- Excuse me.
- But I don't think I understand.
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here in your office as long as I have to.
Live here? Yes?
- Excuse me.
- But a morning newspaper, after all...
Excuse me.
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.
That's one of the things that's going to have to be changed here.
- The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
- That's right.
- Excuse me.
It's impossible...
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.
You certainly aren't.
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.
- You still eating?
- I'm still hungry.
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone in Brooklyn who's missing.
She's probably murdered. Why isn't there something about it in the Inquirer?
We're running a newspaper...
- I'm absolutely starving to death.
... not a scandal sheet.
That's all right.
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline in the Chronicle.
Why hasn't the Inquirer a three-column headline?
The news wasn't big enough.
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough.
- That's right!
- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...
There's no proof that she was murdered, or dead.
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.
If we were interested in that kind of thing, we could fill the paper twice over, daily.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on.
I want you to send your best man to see Mr. Silverstone.
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...
...the Inquirer will have him arrested.
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from...
- Central Office.
- The Central Office.
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious and asks to see your man's badge...
...your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?
I can't see that the function of a respectable newspaper...
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Paper! Read all about it!
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
The mystery of the lady that vanished in Brooklyn.
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.
Three hours and 50 minutes late, but we did it.
- Tired?
- A tough day.
- A wasted day.
- Wasted?
You only made the paper over four times tonight, that's all.
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.
There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print.
I've got to make the New York Inquirer as important to New York...
...as the gas in that light.
What are you going to do, Charlie?
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.
I've got it all written out here.
You don't want to make any promises you don't want to keep.
These'll be kept.
"I'll provide the people of this city...
"... with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.
- "I will also provide... "
- That's two sentences starting with "I."
People will know who's responsible...
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer, quickly, simply and entertainingly.
No special interests will be allowed to interfere with that truth.
"I will also provide them with a fighting and tireless champion of their rights...
"... as citizens and as human beings. "
Signed:
"Charles Foster Kane. "
- Can I have that, Charlie?
- I'm going to print it.
Solly!
Yes, Mr. Kane?
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page.
This morning's front page?
That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again.
- Yes.
- Go down and tell them.
All right.
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.
I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.
- A document...
- Sure.
...like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution...
...and my first report card at school.
I know you're tired, gentlemen, but I brought you here for a reason.
- This little pilgrimage will do us good.
- The Chronicle's a good newspaper.
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.
- With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
- You're right.
You know how long it took the Chronicle to get that staff together?
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?
Six years ago, I looked at a picture of the world's greatest newspaper men.
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.
Make an extra copy of that picture and mail it to the Chronicle.
It'll make you all happy to learn that our circulation this morning...
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.
Right.
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness in taking leave of you.
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.
I've promised my doctor for sometime that I would leave when I could.
I now realize I can't.
Say, Mr. Kane, as long as you're promising...
...there's a lot of pictures and statues in Europe you ain't bought yet.
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.
They've been making statues for 2,000 years.
And I've only been buying for five.
- Promise me, Mr. Kane.
- I promise, Mr. Bernstein.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Bernstein?
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
And now, gentlemen!
Your complete attention, if you please.
Are we going to declare war on Spain?
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.
I said, "Are we going to declare war on Spain, or are we not? "
The Inquirer already has.
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.
I'm not overdressed.
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.
Let's have the song about Charlie.
- Is there a song about Charlie?
- Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town, you get a song written about you.
I've seen that fellow. He's good.
Good evening, Mr. Kane.
"There is a man, a certain man
"And for the poor you may be sure that he'll do all he can
"Who is this one? This favorite son
"Just by his action has the traction magnates on the run
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset if he were really broke
"With wealth and fame he's still the same
"I'll bet you $5 you're not alive if you don't know his name
"What is his name?
"It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!
"He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane"
- Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
- Yes.
What's the matter?
"Who says a miss was made to kiss
"And when he meets one always tries to do exactly this
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks
"Who thinks that dough was made to spend and acts the way he thinks
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"
Bernstein, these men who are now with the Inquirer...
...who were with the Chronicle until yesterday...
Oh, mama, please.
- Give me that.
- What? The blonde?
- No, the brunette.
- Where did you learn that, Charlie?
Bernstein, these men who were with the Chronicle...
...weren't they just as devoted to the Chronicle policy...
...as they are now to our policies?
Sure, they're just like anybody else.
They got work to do, they do it.
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Do we stand for the same things the Chronicle stands for?
Certainly not.
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane.
Without his knowing it.
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!
- I got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
- What?
- From Paris, France.
- What?
- From Paris, France.
- Come on in.
"Who by his action has the traction magnates on the run"
It's a good thing he promised not to send back any more statues.
Look, he wants to buy the world's biggest diamond.
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.
I wanted Charlie to have fun, with me along...
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?
Yes.
If you thought I'd answer you different from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.
"World's biggest diamond. "
I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds.
He ain't.
He's collecting somebody that's collecting diamonds.
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...
"... from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer. "
Here he comes!
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
- I know I've a moustache.
- It looks awful.
Have we got a society editor?
- Right here, Mr. Kane.
- Miss Townsend is the society editor.
Miss Townsend, this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.
I got a little social announcement.
I wish you wouldn't treat this any differently than you would any other...
...social announcement.
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees of the Inquirer...
Mr. Bernstein, thank you very much, everybody, I...
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.
Goodbye.
Say, he was in an awful hurry.
Hey, everybody, look out here.
Let's go to the window.
- Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
- Yes, Ms. Townsend?
This announcement:
"Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...
"... announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...
"... to Mr. Charles Foster Kane. "
Come on.
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece of the President of the United States.
President's niece?
Before he's through, she'll be a president's wife.
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended.
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...
...this Rosebud you're trying to find out about...
Yes?
Maybe that was something he lost.
Mr. Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.
You ought to see Jed Leland.
Of course, he and Mr. Kane didn't exactly see eye to eye.
You take the Spanish-American war.
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.
We didn't really have anything to fight about.
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war of Mr. Kane's...
...we'd have the Panama Canal?
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.
A lot of the time now they don't tell me these things.
Maybe even he's dead.
In case you'd like to know...
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say. I had...
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me, just...
Just old age.
It's the only disease that you don't look forward to being cured of.
I can remember absolutely everything, young man.
That's my curse.
That's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race: Memory.
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.
Maybe I wasn't his friend, but if I wasn't, he never had one.
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.
You were about to say something about Rosebud.
Do you happen to have a good cigar?
I've got a young physician here who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.
I changed the subject, didn't I?
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.
You're a reporter and you want to know what I think about Charlie Kane.
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness.
But he kept it to himself.
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.
He just left you a tip.
He had a generous mind.
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.
But he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane.
He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life.
I suppose he died without one.
That must have been pretty unpleasant.
Of course, a lot of us check out without having any special convictions about death.
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.
Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
- Sorry, Mr. Leland.
- Never mind.
- What do you know about Rosebud?
- "Rosebud"?
His dying words: "Rosebud. "
I saw that in the Inquirer.
I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.
Anything else?
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.
I was very graceful.
- We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
- What was she like?
She was like all the girls I knew in dancing school.
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.
After the first couple of months...
...she and Charlie didn't see much of each other except at breakfast.
It was a marriage just like any other marriage.
- You're beautiful.
- I can't be.
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.
I've never been to six parties in one night before.
- I've never been up this late.
- It's a matter of habit.
- What will the servants think?
- That we enjoyed ourselves.
Why do you have to go straight off to the newspaper?
You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.
I absolutely adore you.
Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep.
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon.
What time is it?
I don't know. It's late.
It's early.
Charles...
Do you know how long you kept me waiting last night...
...when you went to the newspaper for 10 minutes?
What do you do in a newspaper in the middle of the night?
My dear, your only correspondent is the Inquirer.
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.
I don't spend that much time on the newspaper.
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.
- You mean Uncle John.
- I mean the President of the United States.
He's still Uncle John and a well-meaning fathead...
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure crooks run his administration.
- This whole oil scandal...
- He happens to be the President, not you.
That's a mistake that will be corrected one of these days.
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior the most incredible atrocity yesterday.
I simply can't have it in the nursery.
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit to the nursery now and then.
Does he have to?
Yes.
- Really, Charles, people will think...
- What I tell them to think.
Wasn't he ever in love with her?
He married for love.
Love.
That is why he did everything.
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.
All he wanted out of life was love.
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.
You see, he just didn't have any to give.
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.
Very dearly.
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.
- How about his second wife?
- Susan Alexander?
You know what Charlie called her?
The day after he'd met her, he told me about her.
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public. "
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.
That first night, according to Charlie...
...all she had was a toothache.
What are you laughing at, young lady?
- What's the matter with you?
- Toothache.
- What?
- Toothache.
Toothache?
You mean you've got a toothache.
- What's funny about that?
- You're funny, mister.
- You've got dirt on your face.
- Not dirt, it's mud.
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.
What's that, young lady?
I said, if you wanted some hot water...
...I could get you some... hot water.
All right, thank you very much.
Do I look any better now?
- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
- What you need is to get your mind off it.
Excuse me, but my landlady prefers me to keep this door open...
...when I have a gentleman caller.
- All right.
You have got a toothache, haven't you?
- I surely have.
- Why don't you try laughing at me again?
- What?
- I'm still pretty funny.
I know, but you don't want me to laugh at you.
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.
Look at me.
See that?
What are you doing?
I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time.
That's it, smile.
It took me two solid years at the best boys' school in the world to learn that.
The fellow who taught me is now president of Venezuela.
That's it!
- Is it a giraffe?
- No, not a giraffe.
- I bet it is.
- What?
Well, then it's an elephant.
- It's supposed to be a rooster.
- A rooster!
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?
- No, I'm not a magician.
- I was just joking.
You really don't know who I am?
You told me your name, Mr. Kane, but I'm awfully ignorant.
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.
You really like me, though, even though you don't know who I am?
I surely do. You've been wonderful.
Without you I don't know what I would have done.
I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.
I know too many people.
I guess we're both lonely.
Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.
I was just joking.
I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...
...in search of my youth.
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.
There wasn't any other place to put them.
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.
A sort of sentimental journey.
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?
Me?
- How old did you say you were?
- I didn't say.
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.
- How old?
- Pretty old.
- How old?
- Twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.
- Is that what you want to do?
- No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.
- That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
- What happened to the singing?
Mother always thought, she always talked about grand opera for me.
Imagine.
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.
Yes.
- Have you got a piano?
- A piano?
Yes, there's one in the parlor.
- Would you sing for me?
- You wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you.
No, that's all gone.
All right.
Let's go to the parlor.
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine
"I have sworn it
"For weal or woe
"Yes, Lindor
"Lo giurai
"La vincerò"
There is only one man who can rid the politics...
...of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane, the fighting liberal...
...the friend of the workingman, the next governor of this state...
...who entered upon this campaign...
...with one purpose only:
To point out and make public the dishonesty...
...the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...
...now in complete control of the government of this state.
I made no campaign promises...
...because. Until a few weeks ago.
I had no hope of being elected.
Now. However. I have something more than a hope.
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.
Every straw vote...
...every independent poll shows that I will be elected.
Very well.
Now I can afford to make some promises.
The workingman and the slum child...
...know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.
The decent. Ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power...
...to protect the underprivileged.
The underpaid. And the underfed.
- Mother, is Pop governor yet?
- Not yet, Junior.
I'd make my promises now...
...if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.
But here's one promise I'll make...
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.
My first official act as governor of this state...
...will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment...
...prosecution and conviction of Boss Jim W. Gettys.
If the election were held today, you'd be in by 100,000 votes.
- Gettys isn't even pretending.
- Pop.
- Hello, son.
- He isn't just scared, he's sick.
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.
- Did you like your old man's speech?
- I could hear every word.
- Hello, Emily.
- Hold it.
- Great speech, Mr. Kane.
- Wonderful.
Will you get us a taxi?
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver.
Good night, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?
There's a call I want you to make with me.
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.
What's this all about, Emily?
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to "185 West 74th Street. "
If you wish, you may come with me.
I'll come with you.
I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emily.
Come right in, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.
He's been saying the most terrible...
Mrs. Kane.
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.
I'm Jim Gettys.
Yes?
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.
Charlie, the things he said to me...
He threatened to...
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.
Your breaking this man's neck would scarcely explain this note:
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane, for yourself and for your son. "
- He wanted to get her to come here...
- What does this note mean?
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking...
- What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
- She don't know.
She sent it because I told her it wouldn't be smart not to.
- Emily, this gentleman...
- I'm not a gentleman.
Your husband is only trying to be funny calling me one.
I don't even know what a gentleman is.
You see, my idea of a gentleman...
If I owned a paper and didn't like the way somebody was doing things...
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...
...so his family could see his picture in the paper.
- You're a cheap, crooked grafter...
- We're talking now about what you are.
I'm fighting for my life, not just my political life.
- He said unless you...
- That's what I said.
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's so sick he has to go away for a year...
...Monday morning, all papers in the state, except his, will carry the story I'll give.
What story?
- The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
- There isn't any story!
Shut up.
We've got evidence that would look bad in the headlines.
Do you want me to give you the evidence?
I'd rather he withdrew without having the story published.
Not that I care about him, but I'd be better off that way.
So would you, Mrs. Kane.
What about me?
He said my name would be dragged through the mud. That everywhere I went...
There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.
I'd say that it'd been made for you.
You can't tell me the voters of this state...
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.
I am interested in our son.
- Charlie, if they publish this story...
- They won't.
Good night, Mr. Gettys.
Are you coming, Charles?
No.
I'm staying here.
I can fight this all alone.
If you don't listen to reason, it may be too late.
Too late? For what?
For you and this public thief...
...to take the love of the people away from me?
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.
You don't want him to read about you in the papers.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'll do. And that's me.
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought.
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- You're licked...
Get out. If you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.
Only you're going to need more than one lesson.
- And you'll get more than one lesson.
- Don't worry about me, Gettys.
Don't worry about me!
I'm Charles Foster Kane!
I'm no cheap, crooked politician trying to save himself...
...from the consequences of his crimes!
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.
Sing Sing, Gettys.
- Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Paper. Read all about it. Extra. Extra.
- Paper?
- No, thanks.
With a million majority already against him...
...and the church counties still to be heard from...
...I'm afraid we got no choice.
This one?
That one.
Good night again.
- Is there anything I can...
- No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.
You better go home and get some sleep.
You, too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
- Hello, Jedediah.
- I'm drunk.
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.
I'm not interested.
I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it?
All right.
If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice.
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.
You talk about the people as though you owned them.
As though they belong to you. Goodness.
As long as I can remember, you've talked about giving the people their rights...
...as if you could make them a present of liberty...
...as a reward for services rendered.
- Jed.
- You remember the workingman?
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...
...if it'll do any good.
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.
You used to write an awful lot about the workingman...
Go on home.
He's turning into something called
"organized labor. "
You won't like that one little bit when you find out...
...it means your workingman expects something as his right, and not your gift.
When your precious underprivileged really get together...
Oh, boy...
That'll add up to something bigger than your privilege...
...then I don't know what you'll do.
Sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
There'll probably be a few of them there to tell me when I do something wrong.
You may not always be so lucky.
You're not very drunk.
Drunk, what do you care?
You don't care about anything except you.
You persuade people that you love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms.
It's something to be played your way, according to your rules.
- Let me work on the Chicago paper.
- What?
You said you were looking for someone to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.
I am drunk.
I want to go to Chicago.
You're too valuable here.
- There's nothing left for me to do...
- All right, you can go to Chicago.
Thank you.
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.
I warn you, Jedediah, you won't like Chicago.
The wind comes off the lake, and they've probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.
Will Saturday after next be all right?
- Anytime you say.
- Thank you.
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:
His own.
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.
- What's that, young man?
- Are you through with politics?
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.
We're going to be an opera star.
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?
We certainly are.
Charlie said if I didn't, he'd build me an opera house.
That won't be necessary.
No, no, no!
Places, please!
Mr. Leland is writing it from the dramatic angle?
- And we've covered it from the news end.
- And the social.
How about the music notice?
Yes, it's already made up.
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.
- Enthusiastic?
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.
We've got two spreads of pictures.
The music notice on the front page?
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.
The dramatic notice.
- Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
- Yes, we're waiting for it.
- Where is he?
- Right in there, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane.
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...
...haven't spoken together for years.
- You don't suppose...
- There's nothing to suppose.
Excuse me.
Close the door.
He ain't been drinking before.
Never. We would have heard.
What does it say there?
The notice, what's he written?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur...
"... last night opened the new Chicago Opera House...
"... in a performance of... "
I still can't pronounce that name.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.
"Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to... "
Go on.
That's all there is.
Of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except...
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it represents a new low.
- In the opinion of this reviewer.
- I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.
- Mr. Kane, I...
- Get me a typewriter.
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.
Hello, Bernstein.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.
- Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
- Charlie?
Charlie out there?
I guess he's fixing it up.
I knew I'd never get that through.
Mr. Kane's finishing your review just the way you started it.
He's writing a bad notice like you wanted it to be.
I guess that'll show you.
Hello, Jedediah.
Hello, Charlie.
I didn't know we were speaking.
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.
You're fired.
Everybody knows that story. Mr. Leland.
But why did he do it?
- How could a man write a notice...
- You just don't know Charlie.
He thought that by finishing that notice he'd show me he was an honest man.
He was always trying to prove something.
That whole thing about Susie being an opera singer.
That was trying to prove something.
You know what the headline was the day before the election?
"Candidate Kane found in love nest with 'singer. "'
He was going to take the quotes off the singer.
Hey, nurse!
Five years ago he wrote from that place down there in the South.
What's it called, Shangri-la? El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.
Well, I never even answered his letter.
Maybe I should have.
I guess he was pretty lonely down there in that coliseum all those years.
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.
He never finished anything except my notice.
- Of course, he built the joint for her.
- That must have been love.
I don't know.
He was disappointed in the world so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.
It was something bigger than an opera house anyway.
- Nurse.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.
I'm coming.
- There's one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.
Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.
One is enough.
When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty.
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.
- I'll take your arm.
- All right.
- You won't forget about those cigars?
- I won't.
Have them wrapped like toothpaste, or they'll stop them at the desk.
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...
...he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.
You don't want to hear what comes into my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung for Charlie that first time I met him.
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.
- The teachers got that, I didn't.
- What did you get?
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.
He married you, didn't he?
He didn't mention anything about marriage until after it was over and...
...until it got in the papers about us...
...and he lost the election, and that Norton woman divorced him.
He was really interested in my voice.
Why did he build that opera house?
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.
Everything was his idea...
...except my leaving him.
"Don't forget"
Don't get nervous.
Please. Let's come back.
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.
"Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask
"Diaphragm"
You're out of pitch.
Some people can sing. Some can't.
Impossible.
It's not your job to give your opinion of Mrs. Kane's talents.
You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.
Please continue with the lesson.
- But, Mr. Kane.
- Please.
I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world. People will think...
You're concerned what people will think?
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.
The newspapers for example.
I run several newspapers between here and San Francisco.
It's all right, darling.
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.
- How can I persuade you...
- You can't.
It's all right, darling, go ahead.
I thought you'd see it my way.
No, no, no.
"Ah. Cruel
"Tu m'as trop entendue
"Les Dieux m'en sont témoins
"Ces Dieux qui dans mon flanc
"Ont allumé
"Le feu fatal
"A tout mon sang
"Dites-moi comment j'expie
"Ce péché si fort
"Toujours remplie
"Je ne peux pas résister encore
"Oh Dieux. Arrachez-moi
"Ces feux fatals"
I think it's dreadful.
"Allument ma mort
"Voilà mon cœur
"Voilà mon cœur
"C'est Ià que ta main doit frapper
"Voilà mon cœur
"Frappe
"Prête-moi ton épée
"Frappe"
Stop telling me he's your friend.
A friend don't write that kind of review.
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that, spoiling my whole debut.
Come in.
I'll get it.
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...
...but I'm not high class like you.
And I never went to any swell schools.
That'll be enough, Susan.
From Mr. Leland, sir.
He wanted me to make sure you got this personally.
Is that something from him?
Charlie!
As for you, you ought to have your head examined.
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...
...with a $25,000 check in it.
What kind of firing do you call that?
You did send him a check for $25,000, didn't you?
Yes.
I sent him a check for $25,000.
What's that?
Declaration of Principles.
What?
What is it?
An antique.
You're awful funny, aren't you?
I'll tell you one thing you're not going to be funny about, and that's my singing.
I'm through.
I never wanted to do it in the first place.
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous.
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous!
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.
You seem unable to understand them.
I will not tell them to you again.
You'll continue with your singing.
Get Dr. Corey.
Susan.
She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a foolish mistake.
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her was in a somewhat larger bottle.
The strain of preparing for the new opera has excited and confused her.
Yes, I'm sure that was it.
No objections to my staying with her are there?
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.
But I couldn't go through with the singing again.
You don't know what it means to know that people...
That the whole audience doesn't want you.
That's when you got to fight them.
All right.
You won't have to fight them anymore.
It's their loss.
What are you doing?
Jigsaw puzzles?
Charlie, what time is it?
In New York?
I said what time is it in New York?
- Night?
The Bulldog's just gone to press.
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.
People are going to nightclubs and restaurants.
Of course, we're different because we live in a palace.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
A person could go crazy in this dump.
Nobody to talk to, nobody to have any fun with.
49,000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues.
I'm lonesome.
Until yesterday, we've had no less than 50 of your friends at any one time.
I think if you look in the west wing...
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists still in residence.
You make a joke out of everything.
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.
Charlie, please.
Our home is here, Susan.
I don't care to visit New York.
What are you doing?
One thing I can never understand:
How do you know you haven't done it before?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting statues.
You may be right.
I sometimes wonder...
...but you get into the habit.
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
Invite everybody to spend the night at the Everglades.
Invite everybody. Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents.
Who wants to sleep in tents when they've got their own room...
...with a bath, where they know where everything is?
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
You never give me anything
I really care about.
"It can't be love
"For there is no true love
"I know I've played at the game
"Like a moth in a blue flame
"Lost in the end, just the same
"All these years
"My heart's been floating around in a puddle of tears
"I wonder what it is"
Sure, you give me things, but that don't mean anything to you.
You're in a tent, darling, you're not at home.
I can hear you very well if you speak in a normal tone of voice.
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...
...for a statue you'll keep crated up and never look at?
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.
You never really gave me anything that you care about.
I want you to stop this.
I'm not going to stop it.
You never gave me anything in your life.
You just tried to buy me into giving you something.
"It can't be love"
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.
You don't love me.
You want me to love you.
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.
"Whatever you want, just name it and it's yours.
"But you gotta love me. "
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Mr. Kane?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.
Marie has been packing for her since morning.
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.
Yes, madame.
Have you gone completely crazy?
Don't you know that our guests, that everyone will know about this?
Packed your bag, sent for the car...
And left you?
Of course they'll hear.
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.
But I never imagined people wouldn't know.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Susan.
Please don't go.
Please, Susan.
From now on, everything will be exactly the way you want it to be.
Not the way I think you want it, but...
...your way.
You mustn't go.
You can't do this to me.
I see.
It's you that this is being done to.
It's not me at all.
Not what it means to me.
I can't do this to you?
Oh, yes, I can.
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.
The last 10 years have been difficult for many.
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.
- You're going down to Xanadu?
- Monday, with boys from the office.
Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed.
We run a picture magazine.
If you're smart, you'll get in touch with Raymond. He's the butler.
You'll learn a lot from him.
He knows where all the bodies are buried.
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.
Don't you think I do?
What do you know, it's morning already.
Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.
Rosebud?
I'll tell you about Rosebud.
How much is it worth to you?
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.
- He acted funny sometimes, you know?
- No, I didn't.
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.
I've been working for him 11 years now...
...in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.
- Rosebud.
- Yes.
Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes...
...but I knew how to handle him...
- Need a lot of service?
But I knew how to handle him.
Like that time his wife left.
Rosebud.
I see.
And that's what you know about Rosebud?
I heard him say it that other time, too.
He just said:
"Rosebud. "
Then he dropped the glass ball and it broke on the floor.
He didn't say anything after that, and I knew he was dead.
He said all kinds of things that didn't mean anything.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
- Yes and no.
- That isn't worth $1,000.
You can keep on asking questions if you want to.
We're leaving tonight...
...when we're through taking pictures.
Allow yourself plenty of time.
The train stops at the junction on signal, but they don't like to wait.
I can remember when they'd wait all day...
...if Mr. Kane said so.
Better get going.
- Can we come down?
- Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.
How much do you think this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions.
If anybody wants it.
Well, at least he brought all this stuff to America.
- What's that?
- Another Venus.
A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
The banks are out of luck?
- They'll clear all right.
- He never threw anything away.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer. "
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."
We're supposed to get everything, junk as well as art.
He sure liked to collect things.
Anything and everything.
A regular crow, eh?
- Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
- We got a lot of those.
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.
Part of a Scotch castle...
...that needs to be unwrapped.
Put all this stuff together:
The palaces and the paintings, and the toys and everything.
What would it spell?
- Charles Foster Kane?
- Or Rosebud.
- How about it, Jerry?
- What's Rosebud?
That's what he said when he died.
Did you ever find out what it means?
- No, I didn't.
- What did you find out about him?
Not much, really.
We'd better get started.
What have you been doing all this time?
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.
No, I don't think so.
No.
He was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or something he lost.
It wouldn't have explained anything.
I don't think any word can explain a man's life.
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
A missing piece.
Come on, everybody...
...we'll miss the train.
Throw that junk in.
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.
Everything was his idea...
...except my leaving him.
I've got his trunk all packed.
I've had it packed for a week now.
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.
You're gonna need more than one lesson.
And you'll get more than one lesson.
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?
We thought... If we could find out what he meant by his last words as he was dying...
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
"I think it would be fun to run a newspaper. "
"I think it would be fun to run a newspaper. "
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.
You always say that, the same thing every time.
"I'm through, never again, too dangerous."
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.
But you forget about it in a day or two.
Well, the days of me forgetting are over... and the days of me remembering have just begun.
You know when you go on like this what you sound like?
I sound like a sensible fucking man.
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...
Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again... since I'm never gonna do it again... you're never gonna have to hear me quack... about how I'm never gonna do it again.
After tonight.
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I mean, the way it is now... you're taking the same risk as when you rob a bank.
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you... in any way during a robbery.
They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?
You don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
I heard about this one bloke...
He walks into a bank with a portable phone.
He gives the phone to the teller... bloke on the other end of the phone says...
"We got this guy's little girl.
"If you don't give him all your money...
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone... not a pistol, not a shotgun... a fucking phone.
Cleans the place out.
They don't even lift a fucking finger.
Did they hurt the little girl?
I don't know. Probably never was a girl in the first place.
The point isn't the girl.
The point is... they robbed a bank with a telephone.
You want to rob banks?
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.
If we did, it would be easier than what we been doing.
No more liquor stores?
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't even speak fucking English.
You tell 'em,
"Empty out the register..." they don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
They make it too personal.
We keep on, one of these gook fucker's gonna make us kill him.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody, either.
But they'll probably put us in a situation... where it's us or them.
And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fucking Jews... who've owned the store for fifteen fucking generations.
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter... with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
Try walking into one of those places with nothing but a phone.
See how far that gets you.
Fuck it. We're out of it.
Yeah, well, what then?
Day jobs?
- Not in this life.
- What, then?
Garçon! Coffee!
This place.
Garçon means "boy."
This place? A coffee shop?
What's wrong with that?
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations... you get your head blown off sticking up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed.
Not as expecting, anyway.
I bet you could cut down on the hero factor... in a place like this.
Correct.
Same as banks, these places are insured.
Manager... he don't give a fuck.
He's just trying to get you out the door... before you start plugging the diners.
Waitresses? Fucking forget it.
No way they're taking a bullet for the register.
Busboys, some wetback getting paid $1.50 an hour... really give a fuck you're stealing from the owner?
Customers sitting with food in their mouths.
They don't know what's going on.
One minute they're having a Denver omelet... next minute, someone's sticking a gun in their face.
See, I got the idea... last liquor store we stuck up.
Remember?
All the customers kept coming in?
Yeah.
You got the idea taking their wallets.
Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.
Thank you.
Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
Yes, we did.
- People come to restaurants.
A lot of wallets.
Pretty smart, huh?
Pretty smart.
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.
Come on.
- All right.
Same as last time, remember?
You're crowd control.
I handle employees.
I love you, Pumpkin.
I love you, Honey Bunny.
Everybody, be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any of you fucking pricks move... and I'll execute every motherfucking last one of you!
Ha ha ha
Jungle boogie,
Jungle boogie
- Get it on
- Jungle boogie
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie
- Jungle boogie
- Come and shake it around
OK, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- OK. What you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?
Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
You just can't walk into a restaurant... roll a joint, and start puffing away.
I mean, they want you to smoke in your home...
- or certain designated places.
- And those are hash bars?
Yeah, it breaks down like this.
It's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it... and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar... it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, but... but that doesn't matter...
'cause, get a load of this, all right?
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam... it's illegal for them to search you.
I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
Oh, man, I'm going.
That's all there is to it.
I'm fucking going.
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.
But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
- What?
- It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here... but it's just a little different.
Example?
You can go to a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I don't mean just, like, in no paper cup.
I'm talking about a glass of beer.
And in Paris, you can buy a beer at McDonald's.
And you know what they call... a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
No, man, they got the metric system there.
They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.
What do they call it?
They call it a "Royale with Cheese."
- "Royale with Cheese."
That's right.
What do they call a Big Mac?
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it "Le Big Mac."
"Le Big Mac." Ha ha ha ha.
What do they call a Whopper?
I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.
You know what they put on
French fries in Holland...
- instead of ketchup?
- What?
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.
They fucking drown 'em in that shit.
Yuck.
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
- How many up there?
- Three or four.
That's counting our guy?
I'm not sure.
So that means it could be up to five guys up there?
It's possible.
We should have fucking shotguns.
What's her name?
Mia.
Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
I don't know.
However people meet people.
She used to be an actress.
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
Pilot? What's a pilot?
Well, you know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.
Yeah, but you are aware... that there's an invention called television... and on this invention they show shows, right?
Yeah.
The way they pick TV shows, they make one show.
That show's called a pilot.
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows... and on the strength of that one show... they decide if they want to make more shows.
Some get chosen and become television programs.
Some don't, become nothing.
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan... used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.
Yeah, I think I know who you mean. What about him?
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.
Word around the campfire is... it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
So, what'd he do, fuck her?
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.
Well, then, what, then?
Gave her a foot massage.
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.
Then what did Marsellus do?
Sent a couple of cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio, threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.
They had a little garden down at the bottom... enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
Nigger fell through that.
Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.
That's a damn shame.
But still, I have to say... you play with matches, you get burned.
What do you mean?
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride... a foot massage.
You don't think he overreacted?
Well, Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus... to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.
I give my mother a foot massage.
No, it's laying hands in a familiar way... on Marsellus' new wife.
I mean, is it as bad as eating her pussy out?
No, but it's the same fucking ballpark.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop right there.
Eating a bitch out and giving a bitch a foot massage... ain't even the same fucking thing.
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.
Ain't no fucking ballpark, neither.
Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine... but you know touching his wife's feet... and sticking your tongue in her holiest of holies... ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.
It ain't even the same fucking sport.
Look, foot massages don't mean shit.
Have you ever given a foot massage?
Don't be telling me about foot massages.
I'm the foot fucking master.
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be tickling or nothing.
Would you give a guy a foot massage?
Fuck you.
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage myself.
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.
I'm getting a little pissed here.
- This is the door.
- There it is.
What time you got?
7:22 in the a.m.
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.
Just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage... don't make it right for Marsellus... to throw Antwan off a building... into a glass motherfucking house... fucking up the way the nigger talks. That shit ain't right.
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass...
'cause I'd kill the motherfucker...
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.
But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing... and I'm saying it does.
I've given a million ladies a million foot massages... and they all meant something.
Now, we act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fucking cool about 'em.
There's a sensuous thing going on where, you know... you don't talk about it, but you know it, and she knows it.
Fucking Marsellus knew it... and Antwan should've fucking better known better.
I mean, that's his fucking wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.
You know what I'm saying?
It's an interesting point.
Come on.
Let's get into character.
What's her name again?
- Mia.
- Mia.
Why you so interested in big man's wife?
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida... and he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?
It is not a date.
It's just like if you were going to take your buddy's wife... to a movie or something.
It's just good company, that's all.
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?
Hey, keep chilling.
You know who we are?
We're associates of your business partner...
Marsellus Wallace.
You do remember your business partner, don't you?
Let me take a wild guess here.
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.
I thought so.
You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace... don't you, Brett?
Yeah, I remember him.
Good.
Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.
Sorry about that.
What you having?
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
What kind of hamburgers?
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?
They're good.
You mind if I try one of yours?
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.
Vincent, you ever had a Big Kahuna Burger?
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.
I ain't hungry.
If you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.
Me, I can't usually get 'em...
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian... which pretty much makes me a vegetarian...
But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mmm.
You know what they call... a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?
- No.
- Tell him, Vincent.
Royale with Cheese.
Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?
Because of the metric system?
Check out the big brain on Brett!
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.
What's in this?
- Sprite.
- Sprite, good.
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage... to wash this down with?
Go right ahead.
Ahh.
That hit the spot.
You, Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?
Why don't you tell my man Vince here...
- where you got the shit hid at?
It's over there.
I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing!
- You were saying?
- It's in the cupboard.
N-no.
The one by your kn-knees.
We happy?
Vincent? We happy?
Yeah, we happy.
Pbbbt.
Look... I'm sorry, uh,
I... I didn't get your name.
I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?
But... but I... I never got yours.
My name's Pitt... and your ass ain't talking your way out of this shit.
No, no, no.
I just want you to know how...
I just want you to know how sorry we are... that things got so fucked up with us and... and Mr. Wallace.
W-we got into this thing with the best intentions. I never...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?
I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue.
You were saying something about "best intentions."
What's the matter?
Oh, y-you were finished?
Oh, well, allow me to retort.
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
What?
What country are you from?
Wh-what?
"What" ain't no country
I ever heard of!
- They speak English in "What"?
- Wh-what?
English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
Yes!
- Then you know what I'm saying.
- Yes!
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
What? I...
Say "what" again!
Say "what" again!
I dare you!
I double-dare you, motherfucker!
Say "what" one more goddamn time!
H-h-he's black.
- Go on!
- He's bald.
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?
Oww! Aah!
- Does he look like a bitch?
- No!
Then why you try to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
Yes, you did, Brett!
You tried to fuck him.
- No.
Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked... by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
You read the Bible, Brett?
Y-yes.
Well, there's this passage I got memorized... sort of fits this occasion.
"Ezekiel" 25:17.
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...
"by the inequities of the selfish...
"and the tyranny of evil men.
"Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...
"shepherds the weak through the Valley of Darkness...
"for he is truly his brother's keeper...
"and the finder of lost children.
"And I will strike down upon thee...
"with great vengeance and furious anger...
"those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...
"when I lay My vengeance upon thee!"
No!
Let's stay together
I think you're gonna find... when all this shit is over and done...
I think you're gonna find yourself... one smilin' motherfucker.
Thing is, Butch, right now you got ability.
But painful as it may be, ability don't last.
And your days are just about over.
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life... but that's a fact of life... your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.
See, this business is filled to the brim... with unrealistic motherfuckers... motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.
If you mean it turns to vinegar, it does.
If you mean it gets better with age, it don't.
Besides, Butch... how many fights you think you got in you, anyway?
Hmm? Two?
Boxers don't have an Old-timer's Day.
You came close, but you never made it.
And if you were gonna make it...
You would have made it before now.
Good or bad
Or happy or sad
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooooh, ooh
Yeah
You my nigger?
It certainly appears so.
Night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.
That's pride fucking with you.
Fuck pride!
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.
You fight through that shit.
'Cause a year from now... when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean... you're gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."
Ha ha ha.
I got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace.
In the fifth, your ass goes down.
Say it.
In the fifth, my ass goes down.
Yo, Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam.
Jules Winnfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here!
Goddamn, nigger!
What's up with them clothes?
You don't even want to know.
Where's the big man?
Big man's right over there taking care of some business.
Why don't you hang back for a second or two, you know?
You see the white boy leave, just go on over.
How you been?
I've been doing pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
All right.
So, I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?
At Marsellus' request.
Have you met Mia?
Not yet.
- What's so fucking funny?
- Not a goddamn thing.
I got to piss.
Look, I'm not a fucking idiot, all right?
It's the big man's wife.
I'm gonna sit across from her... chew my food with my mouth closed... laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it.
Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.
Then what did you fucking ask me about it for?
Asshole.
Give me a pack of Red Apples.
Filters?
- Nah.
You looking at something, friend?
You ain't my friend, palooka.
What was that?
I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
Vincent Vega's in the house?
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.
You'd never do that to me
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Pack of Red Apples.
And some matches.
Here's what I want to do
Hey
We ought to stay together
It's as if it turns... every part of your body into the tip of a penis.
Wow.
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.
Well, you see how they use that gun... to pierce your ears?
They don't use that to pierce your nipples, too, do they?
Forget that gun.
That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing.
All my piercing, eighteen places on my body... every one of 'em done with a needle.
Five in each ear. One through the nipple of my left breast.
Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.
And I wear a stud in my tongue.
Excuse me.
I was just curious, but, um... why would you wear a stud in your tongue?
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.
Vincenzo. Step into my office.
This is Panda, from Mexico.
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.
And that is Choco, from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now, the first two are the same...
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.
But this one is a little more expensive.
This is 500 a gram, but when you shoot it... you will know where that extra money went.
Now, there's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.
But this one is a fucking madman.
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.
Now, white people who know the difference... between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge... with that Amsterdam shit any old day of the fucking week.
That's a bold statement.
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.
Heroin is coming back in a big fucking way.
All right, give me three grams of madman.
If it's as good as you say it is...
I'll come back and buy another thousand.
Well, I just hope that I still have some left for you.
But... I'm giving you some out of my own private stash.
That is what a nice guy I am.
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
Yeah, that's cool.
All right.
I'll just get one for you.
Honey, will you get me some baggies... and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
OK.
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.
You want to, uh, hang out, get high?
Which one is Trudi?
The one with all the shit in her face.
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.
No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.
All right. No problemo.
I'll take a rain check.
Oh.
Thank you, Jody.
Still got your Malibu?
Ah, man. You know what some fucker did the other day?
What?
- Fucking keyed it.
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it.
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days... and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
They should be fucking killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.
I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doing it.
It'a been worth him doing it... just so I could've caught him doing it.
- What a fucker!
- What's more chicken shit... than fucking with a man's automobile?
I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Mind if I shoot up here?
Mi casa, su casa.
Muchas gracias.
Hello?
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
Vincent.
Vincent.
I'm on the intercom.
Where is it?
Where is the intercom?
It's on the wall by the two African fellows.
To your right.
...was the son of a preacher man
The only boy...
Warm. Warmer. Disco.
Hello.
Push the button if you want to talk.
- Hello.
- Go make yourself a drink... and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
The bar is by the fireplace.
Being good isn't always easy
OK.
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight?
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was
- Lord knows he was,
- Ooh, yes, he was
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown
And the only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was
Oh, yes, he was
Let's go.
What the fuck is this place?
This is Jack Rabbit Slim's.
An Elvis man should love it.
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...
Oh, after you, kitty cat.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?
There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?
- We reserved a car.
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat them in the Chrysler?
Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock
School gal, baby, gonna tell you some news

Just a minute.
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

Rockin', rockin', baby, gonna rock all night
Rock all night, just wait and see
Ricky! Ricky!
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.
Vincent!
Just so that you all know...
Ricky will be back in the second half of our show.
So we hope you enjoy your meals here at Jack Rabbit Slim's.
Thank you.
Call for...
Phillip... Morris!
What do you think?
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse.
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?
Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.
Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.
How do you want that cooked?
Burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?
Bloody as hell, and oh, yeah, look at this. Vanilla Coke.
What about you, Peggy Sue?
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger, bloody, and... the $5.00 shake.
How do you want that shake?
Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
Martin and Lewis.
Did you just order a $5.00 shake?
Mm-hmm.
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.
Last I heard.
- That's $5.00?
You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?
- No.
- Just checkin'.
I'll be right back with your drinks.
...lonesome town
To cry my troubles away...
Could you, um... roll me one of those, cowboy?
You can have this one, cowgirl.
Thanks.
...with regret
Think nothin' of it.
...lonesome town
I can learn to forget
So... Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
- Sure did.
How long were you there?
Just over three years.
I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.
Why would you?
I heard you did a pilot.
That was my fifteen minutes.
What was it?
It was a show about a team of female secret agents... called "Fox Force Five."
- What?
"Fox Force Five."
Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks.
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.
And Five, as in there's one, two, three, four, five of us.
There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.
She was the leader.
The Japanese Fox was a kung-fu master.
The black girl was a demolition expert.
French Fox's speciality was sex.
What was your specialty?
Knives.
Character I played,
Raven McCoy... her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.
According to the show... she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife... and she knew a zillion old jokes.
Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.
And if we would've got picked up... they would've worked in a gimmick where every show...
I would've told another joke.
You know any of them old jokes?
Well, I only got the chance to say one...
'cause we only did one show.
- Tell me.
- It's corny.
Don't be that way.
Tell me.
No. You wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.
You'd be em...
You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?
I promise I won't laugh.
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.
That's not what I meant, and you know it.
Well, now I'm definitely not gonna tell you...
'cause it's been built up too much.
What a gyp.
Martin and Lewis.
Vanilla Coke.
Mmm. Yummy.
You think
I could have a sip of that?
Be my guest.
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake tastes like.
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.
All right.
Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.
Told you.
I don't know if it was worth $5.00... but it was pretty fucking good.
Don't you hate that?
Hate what?
Uncomfortable silences.
Why do we feel it's necessary... to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
I don't know, but it's a good question.
That's when you know you've found somebody really special... when you can just shut the fuck up for a minute... and comfortably share a silence.
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet... but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
You sit here and think of something to say.
I'll do that.
OK.
I said goddamn! Goddamn.
Goddamn.
I need some hair spray.
Mmm. Don't you just love it... when you come back from the bathroom... to find your food waiting for you?
We're lucky we got anything at all.
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
Would you like some coffee?
Which one? There's two Monroes.
No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.
That is Mamie Van Doren.
And I don't see
Jayne Mansfield.
She must have the night off or somethin'.
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.
So, did you think of somethin' to say?
Actually, I did.
However...
You seem like a really nice person... and I don't want to offend you.
Ooh. This doesn't sound like the usual mindless, boring... gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
That sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
Well, well, I do.
I do.
But you have to promise not to be offended.
No! No, no, no.
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me... so you can go ahead and ask me what you're gonna ask me... and my natural response could be to get offended.
Then, through no fault of my own...
- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.
That's an impossibility.
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this... would be an exercise in futility.
Is that a fact?
Besides, isn't it more exciting...
- when you don't have permission?
All right. All right.
Well, here it goes.
What did you, uh, think about what happened to Antwan?
Who's Antwan?
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
He fell out of a window.
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.
Another way would be was he was thrown out by Marsellus... and yet even another way is to say... he was thrown of a window by Marsellus because of you.
Is that a fact?
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?
They.
They talk a lot, don't they?
They certainly do.
They certainly do.
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...
Did it involve the "F" word?
No. No, no, no.
They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror... out of a four-story window for giving me a foot massage?
Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?
Well, I mean... at the time I was told, it sounded reasonable.
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window... for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
No, it seemed excessive... but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I mean, I understand... that Marsellus is very, very protective of you.
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
A husband almost killing another man... for touching his wife's feet is something else.
But did it happen?
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine... was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
Really?
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus... threw Tony out of that four-story window... except Marsellus and Tony.
But when you little scamps get together... you're worse than a sewing circle.
Ladies and gentlemen... now the moment you've all been waiting for... the world-famous Jack Rabbit
Slim's Twist Contest.
This is where one lucky couple... will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.
Now, who'll be our first contestants?
Right here!
Hey, all right!
- I wanna dance.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I do believe Marsellus... my husband, your boss... told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.
I want that trophy, so dance good.
All right. You asked for it.
Let's hear it for our first contestants.
Let's meet our first contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?
Mrs. Mia Wallace.
And how about your fella here?
Vincent Vega.
All right. Let's see what you can do. Take it away!
Yay!
Go for it!
All right!
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished 'em well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and Madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two-room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
700 little records
All rock, rhythm, and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished 'em well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
Ha ha ha!
Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence?
I don't know what you call that.
Drinks. Music.
I'm gonna take a piss.
That's a little bit more information... than I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.
Girl
Bow, bow, bow
You'll be a woman soon
I love you so much, can't count all the ways
I'd die for you, girl, and all they can say is
He's not your kind
They never get tired of puttin' me down
And I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know, girl
Bow, bow, bow
You'll be a woman soon
One drink and that's it.
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink.
But do it quickly.
Say good night and go home.
Girl
You'll be a woman soon
Soon
You'll need a woman
I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife
The boy's no good
Well, I finally have found what I've been lookin' for
But if they get a chance, they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby, I've done...
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
Because being loyal is very important.
They never get tired of puttin' me down
And I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know, girl
You'll be a woman soon
Please
Come take my hand
Girl
You'll be a woman soon
Please
Come take my hand
Hello.
Girl
So, you're gonna go out there, you're gonna say...
"Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."
Walk out the door and get in the car.
Go home, jerk off, and that's all you're gonna do.
Now it's up to you, girl
You'll be a woman soon
Please
Come take my hand
You'll be a woman soon
Soon
You'll need a man
All right, Mia.
So, listen, I gotta go.
All right?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
You f... Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!
Oh, come on, girl.
We're gettin' out of here.
We gotta walk now.
Don't fucking die on me, Mia.
Silly fuck.
Answer!
Have you got the ring?
Why, certainly.
Join hands, you two love birds.
Uh-uh.
Please. Please.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.
Hold hands, you love birds.
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!
Now, what do you say?
I give up,
I'll marry you!
Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!
I can hear it.
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes... never to call here this late.
Yeah, I told 'em... and that is exactly what I'm going to tell... this fucking asshole right now.
I'll teach you a thing or two.
Don't you dare strike me!
Hello?
Lance, Vincent.
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm comin' to your house.
Whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses, man.
Wh-what's the problem?
I got this chick, she's fuckin' Odin on me.
Don't bring her here.
I'm not even fucking joking with you, man.
Don't not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-butt to my house.
No choice.
She's O.D. In'?
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
OK, well, then you bite the fuckin' bullet... and you take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
Negative.
This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this!
Are you talking to me on a cellular phone?
I don't know you.
Who is this?
Don't come here.
I'm hanging up the phone.
Prank caller! Prank caller!
What the hell was that?!
Have you lost your fucking mind?!
You were talking about drug shit on a cellular ph...
Lance, help me.
You crashed your car into my fuckin' house!
Grab her feet.
Hey, hey, hey!
Are you deaf?
You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house!
This fucked-up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife.
Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
Yeah.
If she croaks on me,
I'm a fucking grease spot!
I will be forced to tell him that you did not help... and that you let her die on your fuckin' lawn.
Now, come on, help me.
Help me. Pick her up.
Shit!
Lance!
Shit!
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
What the fuck's going on out here?
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Who's she?
Go to the fridge and get the adrenaline shot.
What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!
- Get her out of here!
Get the shot!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, too!
What a fuckin' bitch.
Just keep talkin' to her.
She's gettin' the shot.
I'm gonna go get my little black medical book.
What the fuck you need a medical book for?
I never had to give an adrenaline shot before.
You've never given an adrenaline shot?
I never had to.
I don't go joypopping with a bunch of bubblegummers.
My friends can handle their highs.
- Get the shot!
- I am if you'll let me.
I ain't fucking stopping you!
Well, stop talkin' to me.
Start talkin' to her!
- Get the shot!
- All right!
Hurry up, Lance!
We're losin' her!
I'm lookin' as fast as I can!
What's he lookin' for?
I don't know. Some book.
What are you lookin' for?
My little black medical book!
What are you lookin' for?
A little black fuckin' medical book!
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
I never saw no medical book.
Well, trust me, I have one.
If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!
While you're lookin' for it, she's gonna die on our carpet.
You're never gonna find anything in this mess.
Honey, I'm going to fucking kill you if you don't shut up!
Get in here!
Christ.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Pig.
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
While I'm doin' this... you take off her shirt and find her heart.
It's got to be exact?
Yeah, exact.
A shot in the heart, so I guess it's gotta be exact.
I don't know exactly where her heart is. I think it's here.
- That's it.
- This it?
What I need is a big fat magic marker.
- You got it?
- What?
A magic marker! A felt pen!
A fuckin' black magic marker!
All right.
Hurry up.
Fuck. OK, OK, OK.
I think it's ready.
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- I'll tell you what to do.
No, no, no.
You're gonna give her the shot.
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I never done this before.
I ain't never done it before, either. I ain't startin' now.
You brought her here, that means you're gonna give her the shot.
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house... then I give her the shot.
Give her the shot.
- Give it to me.
- Here.
Give me that.
Tell me what to do.
OK. You're giving her an injection of adrenaline... straight to her heart, but she's got a breastplate.
You've got to pierce through that.
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
I gotta stab her three times?
No! You don't gotta stab her three times. Just once.
But hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.
Once you do that, you press down on the plunger.
OK, then what happens?
I'm kind of curious about that myself.
This ain't no fuckin' joke, man!
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!
She's supposed to come out of it like that.
All right. Count to three.
Ready?
One... two...
Three!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
If you're all right, then say something.
Something.
Ha ha. That was fuckin' trippy.
Ha ha ha ha.
Uhh.
Oh, man.
Mia. Mia.
What's... what's your thoughts on... on... on how to handle this?
What's yours?
Well, I'm of the opinion... that if Marsellus lived his whole life... he don't need to know nothin' about this incident.
If Marsellus knew about this incident...
I'd be in as much trouble as you.
I seriously doubt that.
I can keep a secret if you can.
Shake on it?
Mum's the word?
Cool.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm gonna go home and have a heart attack.
Vincent!
Do you want to hear my "Fox Force Five" joke?
Sure.
Except that I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.
I can't wait.
OK.
Three tomatoes are walking down the street...
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato, and Baby Tomato.
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind... and Papa Tomato gets really angry... goes back and squishes him, and says, "Catch up."
Hmm. Hmm.
Ketchup.
See you around.
Oh, that Paddlefoot... he funny, silly dog.
He think totem pole alive.
Hee hee hee!
He arctic tenderfoot.
Ho ho ho ho!
That totem pole been here forever.
Butch?
Butch, stop watching TV a second.
Yeah?
We got a special visitor.
Now... do you remember when I told you... your daddy died in a P.O.W. Camp?
Well... this here is Captain Koons.
He was in the P.O.W. Camp with Daddy.
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together... over five years.
Hopefully... you'll never have to experience this yourself... but when two men are in a situation... like me and your dad were for as long as we were... you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
If it had been me who'd... not made it...
Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son... Jim.
But the way it turned out...
I'm talkin' to you...
Butch.
I got somethin' for ya.
This watch I got here... was first purchased by your great-grandfather... during the First World War.
It was bought in a little general store... in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.
Up till then, people just carried pocket watches.
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge... on the day he set sail for Paris.
This was your great- grandfather's war watch... and he wore it every day he was in that war.
And when he'd done his duty... he went home to your great-grandmother... took the watch off... put it in an old coffee can... and in that can it stayed...
Till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge... was called upon by his country... to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
This time they called it
World War II.
Your great-grandfather gave this watch... to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.
Dane was a marine, and he was killed... along with all the other marines at the Battle of Wake Island.
Your granddad was facing death.
He knew it.
None of those boys had any illusions... about ever leaving that island alive... so, three days before the Japanese took the island... your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport... name of Winocki... a man he had never met before in his life... to deliver to his infant son... who he had never seen in the flesh... his gold watch.
Three days later, your granddad was dead... but Winocki kept his word.
After the war was over... he paid a visit to your grandmother... delivering to your infant father... his dad's gold watch.
This watch.
This watch was on your daddy's wrist... when he was shot down over Hanoi.
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
He knew that if the gooks ever saw the watch... they'd confiscate it... take it away.
The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.
He'd be damned if any slopes put their greasy yellow hands... on his boy's birthright, so he hid it... in one place he knew he could hide somethin'... his ass.
Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.
Then he died of dysentery, he give me the watch.
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass, two years.
Then... after seven years...
I was sent home to my family.
And... now... little man,
I give the watch to you.
It's time, Butch.
...weighing 210 pounds...
Floyd Ray Wilson!
It's official.
It's official. Wilson is dead!
Dan, that had to be the bloodiest... and the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.
Coolidge left faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer... leave the ring.
Do you think he knew
Wilson was dead?
My guess would be yes, Richard.
I could see the frenzy in his eyes... give way to the realization of what he was doing.
I think any man would have left the ring that fast.
Do you feel this tragedy... is gonna have an effect on the world of boxing?
Such a tragedy can't help but shake the boxing world... to its very foundations... but par amount importance is during the sad weeks ahead... the eyes of the WBA remain...
Mia.
Marsellus?
I didn't do it, man.
How you doin'?
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.
What you got?
He booked.
His trainer?
Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.
Think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
No, we don't wanna think, we wanna know.
Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.
Butch's search... how do you want it done?
I'm prepared to scour the earth for that motherfucker.
If Butch goes to Indochina...
I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice... ready to pop a cap in his ass.
I will take care of it.
Mister?
Hey, mister?
What?
You were in that fight.
The fight on the radio.
You're the fighter?
Now, what gave you that idea?
No, ho, come on.
You're him.
I know you're him.
Tell me you're him.
I'm him.
You killed the other boxing man.
He's dead?
The radio said he was dead.
Sorry about that, Floyd.
What does it feel like?
What does what feel like?
Killing a man.
Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
Are you a weirdo?
No.
It is a subject
I have much interest in.
You are the first person
I've met... who has killed somebody.
So... what does it feel like to kill a man?
I'll tell you what.
You give me one of them cigarettes you got up there... and I'll tell you all about it.
So...
Esmarelda...
Villalobos.
Is that Mexican?
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
That's some handle you got there, honey.
Thank you.
And what is your name?
Butch.
What does it mean?
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.
What is it you wanna know?
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
I couldn't tell ya.
I didn't know he was dead until you told me he was dead.
Now that I know he's dead... you wanna know how I feel about it?
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man... the odds went through the roof.
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.
If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
He never laced up his gloves... which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place... he'd still be alive.
Yeah, well... who gives a fuck?
It's over now.
Well, enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.
How many bookies you lay it around on?
All eight?
How long to collect?
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand, a few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news... that is great news, man.
Yeah, mm-hmm.
No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.
It'll probably take us a couple of days to get to Knoxville.
OK, my brother.
You're right.
You're goddamn right.
All right, Scotty.
Next time I see you, we'll be on Tennessee time.
Be cool, brother.
And, uh, here's a little... somethin' for the effort.
Now... if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight... what are you gonna say?
The truth.
Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.
Buenas noches, Butch.
Keep the light off.
Is that better, sugar pop?
Oui.
Hard day at the office?
Pretty hard.
I got in a fight.
Poor baby.
Can we make spoons?
You know what? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
Mmm. I like the way you stink.
Let me take this jacket off.
I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Uh-huh.
I wish I had a pot.
You were lookin' at yourself in the mirror... and you wish you had some pot?
A pot.
A pot belly.
Pot bellies are sexy.
Well, you should be happy...
'cause you have one.
Shut up, fatso!
I don't have a pot.
I have a bit of a tummy... like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."
It's not the same thing.
I didn't know there was such a difference... between a pot belly and a tummy.
The difference is huge.
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
No. Pot bellies make a man... look either oafish or like a gorilla.
But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy.
The rest of you is normal.
Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass... but with a big perfectly round pot belly.
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small... to accentuate it.
You think men would find that attractive?
I don't give a damn what men find attractive.
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch... and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
If you had a pot belly...
I would punch you in it.
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.
Ah! I'd smother you.
I'd drop it right on your face till you couldn't breathe.
You'd do that?
Yes. Yes.
Did you get everything?
Yes, I did.
Good job, sugar pop.
Did everything go as planned?
You didn't listen to the... Ow!
You didn't listen to the radio?
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?
I won, all right.
Are you still retiring?
Sure am.
So, it all worked out in the finish?
We're not at the finish yet, baby.
Mmm.
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?
But they won't find us, will they?
Do you still want me to go with you?
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance, it's...
Say it.
Fabienne...
I want you to be with me.
Forever?
Forever and ever.
Do you love me?
Very, very much.
Mmm.
Butch?
Yes.
Will you give me oral pleasure?
Will you kiss it?
But you first.
OK.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Butch.
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.
Mmm.
I think I cracked a rib.
Giving me oral pleasure?
No, retard. From the fight.
Don't call me retard.
My name is Fabby.
My name is Fabienne.
Stop it. Stop it.
My name is Fabienne.
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.
OK, OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I take it back.
Would you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.
Tulip is much better than mongoloid.
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard, and I took it back.
Uhh.
Butch?
Yes, lemon pie.
Where are we going to go?
Well, I'm not sure yet.
Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from this... but it ain't gonna be the kinda money... that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever.
I was thinkin' maybe we could go down... someplace in the South Pacific.
The kinda money we're gonna have... is gonna carry us a long way down there.
If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
You betcha.
And if after a while you didn't dig that... go someplace else, maybe Tahiti. Mexico.
But I do not speak Spanish.
Well, you do not speak
Bora Boran, either.
Besides, Mexican is easy.
¿Dónde está el zapateria?
What does that mean?
Where is the shoe store?
¿Dónde está...
Spit, please.
¿Dónde está el zapateria?
Excellent pronunciation.
Mmm.
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.
¿Qué hora es?
What time is it?
Time for bed.
Sweet dreams, jellybean.
Butch?
Never mind.
Ohh!
Merde.
You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?
Shit.
What is this you're watching?
A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.
Are you watchin' it?
In a way.
It's a little early in the morning... for explosions and war.
What was it about?
How should I know, Fabienne?
You were the one who was watchin' it.
No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
I don't know. I don't remember.
It's really rare that I remember my dreams.
Well, let's look at the grumpy man... in the morning.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast?
One more kiss, and I'll get up.
Mmm.
Satisfied?
Yep.
Then get up, lazy bones.
Ohh.
God. Unh.
What time is it?
Almost 9:00 in the morning.
What time does our train arrive?
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
What, lemon pie?
I'm gonna order a big plate... of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup... eggs over easy, and five sausages.
Anything to drink with that?
Ah, that looks nice.
To drink... a tall glass of orange juice and a black cup of coffee.
After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
Pie for breakfast?
Any time of the day is a good time for pie.
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese...
Where's my watch?
It's there.
No, it's not.
Have you looked?
Yes, I fucking looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
You sure you got it?
Yes. Bedside table drawer.
On the little kangaroo?
Yes.
It was on the little kangaroo.
Yeah, well, it's not here now.
Well, it should be.
It most definitely should be, but it's not here now.
So where the fuck is it?
Fabienne... that was my father's fucking watch.
Do you have any idea what he had to go through... to get me that watch?
I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.
All this other shit you could set on fire... but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch!
Now think.
Did you get it?
I believe so.
You believe so?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did, or you didn't get it!
Then I did.
Are you sure?
No.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Motherfucker!
- Motherfucker!
- Aah!
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are?
No!
It's not your fault.
If you left it at the apartment...
If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate... how personal the watch was to me.
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch...
I should've told you that.
You're not a mind reader, are you?
I... I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It just means
I can't have breakfast with you.
Why does it mean that?
Because I got to go back to my apartment and get my watch.
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
Well... that's what I'm going to find out.
If they are and I don't think
I can handle it...
Then I'll split.
I saw your watch.
I thought I brought it.
I'm so sorry.
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.
I'll take your Honda.
I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie.
Blueberry pie.
Maybe not that fast... but pretty fast, OK?
OK.
Bye.
Shit! Of all the fucking things she could fucking forget... she forgets my father's watch!
I specifically reminded her.
"Bedside table, on the kangaroo."
I said the words, "Don't forget my father's watch."
Lookin' good, Butch.
Aah!
Flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire till dawn
With a deck of 51
That's how you're going to beat 'em, Butch.
They keep underestimating you.
Kangaroo
Now, don't tell me
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin'...
Solitaire till dawn
With a deck of 51
Smoking cigarettes
And watching "Captain Kangaroo"
Now, don't tell me
I've nothin' to do
It's good to see you,
I must go
I know I look a fright
Motherfucker.
Huhh!
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
He's dead.
If you need someone to go to court, I'll be glad to help.
That guy was a drunken maniac.
He hit you, and then he crashed into that car.
Who?
Him.
I'll be damned.
Uhh.
Aah! Aah! Uhh!
Aah!
I'm shot!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
- Can I help you with something?
- Shut the fuck up.
Now, you just wait a goddamn minute now.
What the fuck are you up to?
Come here, motherfucker!
- Uhh!
- Uhh!
Uhh!
You feel that sting, big boy, huh?
That's pride fucking with you, see?
You got to fight through that shit.
Uhh! Huh?
You better kill me.
Yeah, somebody's going to get killed.
Somebody's going to get their motherfucking head blown to...
Hold it right there,
God damn it.
This ain't none of your business, mister.
I'm making it my business.
Toss the weapon.
You don't understand, man.
Toss the weapon.
Take your foot off the nigger.
Put your hands behind your head.
Approach the counter right now.
This motherfucker's trying to kill me.
Shut up.
Keep a-comin'. Come on.
Uhh!
Zed, it's Maynard.
Yeah. The spider just caught a couple flies.
Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
That's Zed.
I thought you said you waited for me.
I did.
So how come they're all beat up?
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fighting.
Now, this one right here, he was going to shoot that one.
Is that right?
You going to shoot him, boy?
Huh?
Hey, is Grace all right out front?
Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
No. It's Thursday.
She ought to be fine.
Mm-hmm.
Ahh. Well...
Bring out The Gimp.
I think The Gimp's sleeping.
I guess you'll just have to go wake him up, now, won't you?
Get up.
Get down.
Which one of 'em you want to do first?
I ain't for sure yet.
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.
Catch a nigger by the toe.
If he hollers... let him go.
Eenie, meenie... minie, mo.
My mother said...
To pick the perfect one... and you are...
It.
I guess that means you, big boy.
Shh.
You want to do it in here?
No. Let's do it back there in Russell's old room.
Sounds good to me.
Uhh. Uhh.
You keep an eye on this one.
Yeah!
Uhh!
Yeah!
Yeah, go!
Come on, motherfucker!
Now, motherfucker!
Come on!
Yeah!
Uhh! Uhh! Aah!
Aah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yee!
Yee-haw!
Go!
Come on, motherfucker!
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Come on!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Uhh!
Now, motherfucker!
Aah!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Come on!
Now!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
Shut the fuck up!
Fuck!
Come on!
Yeah.
Haah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh! Uhh!
You want that gun, don't you, Zed?
Go ahead and pick it up.
Go ahead, pick it up.
Come on. Atta boy.
I want you to pick it up...
Zed.
Step aside, Butch.
Uhh!
Fuck!
You OK?
No, man.
I'm pretty fucking far from OK.
Uhh!
Aah!
What now?
Uhh!
What now?
Let me tell you what now.
I'm going to call a couple of hard pipe-hitting niggers... to go to work on the homes here... with a pair of pliers and a blow torch.
You hear me talking, hillbilly boy?
I ain't through with you by a damn sight.
I'm going to get medieval on your ass.
I meant, what now between me and you?
Oh, that what now.
I tell you what now between me and you.
There is no me and you... not no more.
So are we cool?
Yeah, we cool.
Two things...
Don't tell nobody about this.
This shit is between me, you... and Mr. Soon To Be Living...
The Rest Of His Short-Ass Life
In Agonizing Pain... rapist here.
It ain't nobody else's business.
Two...
You leave town tonight... right now.
And when you're gone... you stay gone... or you be gone.
You lost all your L.A.
Privileges. Deal?
Deal.
Get your ass out of here.
Ohh!
Uhh!
Fabienne!
Fabienne!
Fabienne.
Come on, baby, come on.
Get your shit.
We got to go right now.
I was so worried.
What about our bags?
Fuck the bags.
If we don't split right now... we'll miss the train.
I'll be downstairs.
Is everything well?
Just come on!
No talking now.
Are we in danger?
Come on, honey!
Where did you get this motorcycle?
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper.
Come on, let's go.
What happened to my Honda?
I'm sorry, baby.
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?
Come on, let's go, let's go.
You're hurt?
No, no.
I might've broken my nose.
It's no biggie.
Come on, hop on.
Baby, please.
Honey, we got to hit the fucking road. Get on.
I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You were gone so long I started to think dreadful thoughts.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't mean to worry you.
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.
Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
They didn't have blueberry pancakes.
I had to get buttermilk.
Are you sure you're OK?
Honey, since I left you, this has been without a doubt... the single weirdest fucking day of my life.
Come on, hop on.
I'll tell you all about it.
Come on, get on. Gotta go.
Whose motorcycle is this?
It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?
- Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.
Yes, you did, Brett!
- You tried to fuck him.
- No.
And Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked... by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
Oh, God, please.
I don't want to die.
You read the Bible, Brett?
Yes!
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
It sort of fits the occasion.
"Ezekiel" 25: 17.
"The path of the righteous man...
"is beset on all sides...
"by the inequities of the selfish...
"and the tyranny of evil men.
"Blessed is he...
"who in the name of charity and good will...
"shepherds the weak...
"through the Valley of Darkness...
"for he is truly his brother's keeper...
"and the finder of lost children.
"And I will strike down upon thee...
"with great vengeance and furious anger...
"those who attempt to poison...
"and destroy My brothers.
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...
"when I lay My vengeance upon thee."
Uhh!
Aah!
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.
Is he a friend of yours?
Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.
Better tell him to shut the fuck up.
He's getting on my nerves.
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
Slip your mind?
You forget someone was in there with a goddamn hand-cannon?
You see the size of that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.
We should be fucking dead, man.
I know. We was lucky.
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.
Yeah, maybe.
This was divine intervention.
You know what divine intervention is?
I think so.
That means that God came down from Heaven... and stopped the bullets.
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.
God came down from Heaven... and stopped these motherfucking bullets.
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
Don't do that. Don't fucking blow this shit off.
What just happened here was a fucking miracle.
Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.
Do you want to continue this theological discussion... in a car or in a jailhouse with the cops?
We should be fucking dead, my friend.
What happened here was a miracle... and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?
Let's go, nigger. Come on.
Shit.
You ever seen that show "Cops"?
I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on... and he was talking about this gunfight... he had in a hallway with this guy, right?
And he just unloaded on this guy... and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.
OK? It was just him and this guy.
I mean, you know... it's freaky, but it happens.
You want to play blind man, go walk with the shepherd... but me, my eyes are wide fucking open.
What the fuck does that mean?
It means that's it for me.
From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.
Why are you fucking freaking out on us?
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.
I'm through.
Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
Don't worry. I will.
Yeah, and I'll bet you $10,000... he laughs his ass off.
I don't give a damn if he does.
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
Man, I don't even have an opinion.
You got to have an opinion.
Do you think that God came down from Heaven and stopped...
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!
Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.
Why the fuck did you do that?
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.
Oh, man, I've seen some crazy-ass shit in my time...
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.
You probably... You went over a bump or something.
Hey, the car didn't hit no motherfucking bump.
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.
The gun went off.
I don't know why.
Well, look at this fucking mess, man!
We're on a city street in broad daylight.
I can't believe it, man.
Well, believe it now, motherfucker.
We got to get this car off the road.
You know, cops tend to notice shit... like you're driving a car drenched in fucking blood.
Just take it to a friendly place, that's all.
This is the Valley, Vincent.
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places.
Jules, this ain't my fucking town, man!
- Shit!
- What you doing?
I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
Where's Toluca Lake?
It's just over the hill here, over by Burbank Studios.
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...
I don't know what the fuck we going to do, man...
'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.
Jimmie, yo, how you doing, man?
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.
Me and my homeboy are in some serious fucking shit, man.
We're in a car, and we got to get off the road pronto.
I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
We got to be real fucking delicate... with this Jimmie situation.
He's one remark away from kicking our asses out the door.
If he does, what do we do?
We ain't leaving till we made a couple calls... but I don't want it to reach that pitch.
Jimmie's a friend.
You don't come into your friend's house... and start telling him what's what.
Just tell him not to be abusive, that's all.
He kind of freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
Well, put yourself in his position.
It's 8:00 in the morning.
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.
Shit, we got to remember here who's doing who a favor.
If that favor means that I got to take shit... then he can stick that favor straight up his ass.
Nigger, what the fuck did you just do to his towel?
I was drying my hands.
You're supposed to wash them first.
You watched me wash them.
I watched you get them wet.
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.
I used the same fucking soap you did... and the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad.
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
It's shit like this that'll bring this situation... to a head, man.
Look...
I ain't threatening you with nothing, all right?
You know I respect you and all... but just don't put me in this position, all right?
All right. Fine. Fine.
Ask me nice like that, no problem.
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.
Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.
This is some serious gourmet shit.
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied... with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?
Heh! And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
What flavor is this?
Knock it off, Julie.
What?
I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is.
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff... because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
It's the dead nigger in my garage.
Oh, Jimmie, don't even worry about it.
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.
When you came pulling in here... did you notice a sign out in the front of my house... that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...
Did you notice a sign in the front of my house... that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?
No. I didn't.
You know why you didn't see that sign?
Why?
'Cause it ain't there...
'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fucking business!
Jimmie, we're not going to store the motherfucker.
Don't you fucking realize, man, that if Bonnie comes home... and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?
No marriage counselor, no trial separation.
I'm going to get fucking divorced, OK?
And I don't want to get fucking divorced.
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you... but I don't want to lose my wife doing it, all right?
Jimmie, she ain't going to leave you.
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.
There's nothing you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget... that I love my wife, is there?
Look, you know... she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.
Graveyard shift at the hospital.
You got to make some phone calls?
You got to call some people?
Well, then do it, and get the fuck out of my house... before she gets here.
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't want to fuck your shit up.
I want to call my people, get them to bring us in.
You're fucking my shit up right now!
You'll fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
So just do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.
Well, say she comes home.
What do you think she'll do?
Oh, no fucking shit, she'll freak.
That ain't no kind of answer.
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much?
A lot or a little?
You got to appreciate what an explosive element... this Bonnie situation is.
I mean, if she comes home from a hard day's work... and finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen... doing a bunch of gangster shit... there ain't no telling what she's liable to do.
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.
All I'm doing is contemplating the "ifs."
I don't want to hear about no motherfucking "ifs."
All I want to hear from your ass is...
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.
"Go back in there, chill them niggers out...
"and wait for the cavalry, which will be coming directly."
You ain't got no problem, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker.
Go back in there and chill them niggers out... and wait for The Wolf, who should be coming directly.
You're sending The Wolf?
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
Shit, negro, that's all you had to say.
Is she the hysterical type?
When is she due?
Mm-hmm.
Give me the principals' names again.
Jules.
Mm-hmm.
Vincent.
Jimmie.
Bonnie.
Mm-hmm.
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?
Sure is.
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.
Good. We got one.
So I heard. May I come in?
Yeah, please do.
You must be Jules... which would make you Vincent.
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
If I was informed correctly... the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?
Your wife Bonnie... comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., is that correct?
Uh-huh.
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here... she wouldn't appreciate it none too much?
She wouldn't at that.
That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck out of Dodge... which, if you do what I say when I say it, should be plenty.
Now, you got a corpse in a car... minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.
Do me a favor, will you?
I thought I smelled some coffee back there.
Would you make me a cup?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, how do you take it?
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.
About the car... is there anything I need to know?
Does it stall, smoke, make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?
Anything?
Aside from how it looks, the car is cool.
Positive? Don't get me out there on the road...
I find out the brake lights don't work.
Man, far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop.
Good enough.
Let's go back to the kitchen.
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, Jimmie.
Mmm.
OK, first thing... you two, take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.
That would lead me to believe that in the gar age... or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and shit?
Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.
Good. What I need you two fellas to do... is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car.
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.
Go in the back seat... scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.
Now, it don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
The pools of blood that have collected... you got to soak that shit up.
Now, Jimmie, we need to r aid your linen closet.
I need blankets.
I need comforters.
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.
We need to camouflage the interior of the car.
We're going to line the front seat and back seat... and the floorboards with quilts and blankets.
So if a cop stops us and sticks his big snout in the car... the subterfuge won't last... but at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.
"Please" would be nice.
Come again?
I said a "please" would be nice.
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."
I'm here to tell you what to do.
And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess... you better fucking do it and do it quick.
I'm here to help.
If my help is not appreciated, lots of luck, gentlemen.
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that.
Your help is definitely appreciated.
Mr. Wolf, listen.
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.
I don't like people barking orders at me, that's all.
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.
I think fast, I talk fast... and I need you guys to act fast if you want out of this... so pretty please with sugar on top... clean the fucking car.
Don't be looking at me like that, all right?
I can feel your look.
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
Green.
Nothing except for the mess inside.
Mmm, about twenty minutes.
Nobody who'll be missed.
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.
How we coming, Jimmie?
Pretty good.
I got it all here... but, uh...
Mr. Wolf, you got to understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.
You got to understand something now, Winston.
Uh, no, thank you.
This is our best linen here... and it was a wedding present... from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny... and they're not with us anymore.
I really want to help you guys out...
Let me ask you a question, Jimmie... if you don't mind.
No, please, go ahead.
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny... were they millionaires?
No.
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is... and I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here... they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set... which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.
How about you, Jimmie?
You an oak man?
Oak's nice.
Oh, man.
I will never forgive your ass for this shit.
This is some fucked-up repugnant shit.
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy... that once a man admits that he is wrong... that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?
Get the fuck out my face with that shit.
The motherfucker said that shit never had to pick up... itty-bitty pieces of skull on account of your dumb ass.
I got a threshold, Jules.
I got a threshold for the abuse that I will take.
Right now, I'm a fucking race car, all right?
And you got me in the red.
I'm just saying that it's fucking dangerous... to have a race car in the fucking red, that's all.
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying motherfucker, motherfucker.
Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."
In fact, what the fuck am I doing in the back?
You the motherfucker who should be on brain detail.
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows... and you picking up this nigger's skull.
Fine job, gentlemen.
We may get out of this yet.
I can't believe this is the same car.
Let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet.
Phase one is complete... clean the car... which moves us right along to phase two... clean you two.
Strip.
All the way?
To your bare ass.
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about fifteen minutes... before Jimmie's better half pulls into the driveway.
Damn. This morning air is some chilly shit.
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
You know what you two look like?
What?
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.
Stripping off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.
Don't do nothing stupid... like leaving this shit out front for Otto the Garbageman... you know what I'm saying?
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen... you've both been to County before I'm sure.
Here it comes.
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.
Better you than me, gentlemen.
Ha ha ha!
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.
Get him up there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!
Uh, uh...
Towel 'em.
They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.
Perfect.
Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.
You guys look like...
What do they look like, Jimmie?
Dorks.
They look like a couple of dorks.
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.
Don't make me beg.
OK, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel... are sympathetic to our dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood... so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be going up Hollywood Way.
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws... nobody does a fucking thing till I do something.
- Right.
- What did I say?
Don't do shit unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy.
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off.
I don't why.
I'm cool. I promise you.
Fair enough. Now, I drive real fucking fast, so keep up.
If I get my car back any different than I gave it...
Monster Joe's going to be disposing of two bodies.
Out of my way, Rex.
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.
All right.
Boys, this is Raquel.
Someday, all this will be hers.
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
You guys going to a volleyball game or something?
I'm taking my lady out for breakfast.
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.
It's... it's your future.
I... I see a... a cab ride.
Move out of the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.
Good night, Raquel.
I'll see you guys around.
Stay out of trouble, you crazy kids.
Mr. Wolf,
I just want to tell you... it was a real pleasure watching you work.
Yeah, really, and thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
Call me Winston.
You see that, young lady?
Respect.
Respect for one's elders shows character.
I have character.
Because you are a character... doesn't mean that you have character.
Want to share a cab?
I could go for some breakfast.
Feel like having breakfast with me?
Cool.
I don't know why,
I thought he'd be European...
Yo, man, he's about as European as English Bob.
I know that now, but...
- Was he cool or what?
- Thank you.
Totally fucking cool, in control.
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fucking with him.
I was amazed.
Want some bacon?
No, man. I don't eat pork.
Are you Jewish?
Naw, I ain't Jewish.
I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
Why not?
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.
Hey, a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie... but I'd never know...
'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.
I ain't eating nothing that ain't got sense enough... to disregard its own feces.
How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces.
I don't eat dog, either.
But do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy... but they're definitely dirty.
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
Ah, so by that rationale... if a pig had a better personality... he would cease to be a filthy animal.
Is that true?
We'd have to be talking about one charming motherfucking pig.
He'd have to be ten times more charming... than Arnold on "Green Acres," you know what I'm saying?
Oh, man, that's good.
That's good, man.
You're starting to lighten up.
You been sitting there all serious and shit.
Man, I've just been sitting here thinking.
About what?
About the miracle we witnessed.
The miracle you witnessed.
I witnessed a freak occurrence.
What is a miracle, Vincent?
An act of God.
And what's an act of God?
When, um...
God makes the impossible possible.
But this morning
I don't think qualifies.
Hey, Vincent...
Don't you see?
That shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.
I mean, it could be
God stopped the bullets... or he changed Coke to Pepsi, he found my fucking car keys.
You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
Now, whether or not what we experienced... was an "According to Hoyle" miracle... is insignificant... but what is significant is I felt the touch of God.
God got involved.
But why?
Well, that's what's fucking with me.
I don't know why, but I can't go back to sleep.
You're serious?
You're really thinking about quitting?
- The life?
Yeah.
Most definitely.
Fuck.
What you going to do, then?
Well, that's what I've been sitting here contemplating.
First, I'm going to deliver this case to Marsellus.
Then, basically, I'm just going to walk the earth.
What you mean, walk the earth?
You know, like Caine in "Kung Fu."
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.
And how long do you intend to walk the earth?
Till God puts me where he wants me to be.
And what if he don't do that?
If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
So you decided to be a bum?
I'll just be Jules, Vincent... no more, no less.
No, Jules.
You decided to be a bum...
Just like all those pieces of shit out there... who beg for change... who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.
And without a job, a residence, or legal tender... that's what you're going to be, man.
You're going to be a fucking bum.
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.
Garçon!
Coffee!
What happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.
Garçon means boy.
But water into wine. I...
All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
Don't fucking talk to me that way, man.
If my answers frighten you, Vincent... then you should cease asking scary questions.
I'm going to take a shit.
Let me ask you something.
When did you make this decision?
When you were sitting there eating that muffin?
Well, yeah.
I was sitting here eating my muffin... and drinking my coffee... and replaying the incident in my head... when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.
Fuck.
To be continued.
I love you, Pumpkin.
And I love you, Honey Bunny.
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any of you fucking pricks move... and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!
You got that?
You just be quiet!
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!
You, you're in a blind spot.
Take your dames to that booth on the count of ten.
Mexicans out of the fucking kitchen!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
Where the fuck are you going?
You fucking yuppie! Get down!
Hey, you, throw those bags!
Fucking wanker! Move! Move!
What the fuck are you doing?
Move!
The restaurant's ours!
Move!
Get down on the fucking floor!
Grandpa, down!
I'm the manager here... and there's no problem... no problem at all.
You're going to give me a problem?
No, sir, I'm not.
I thought you said you're going to give me a fucking problem!
You're going to give me a fucking problem?
I think we got a hero here,
Honey Bunny!
Well, just execute him!
I am not a hero.
I'm just a coffee shop...
Get the fuck down!
The restaurant's ours!
Just take whatever you want.
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.
You tell them to be fucking cool...
- and everything will be over!
- Yeah.
- You understand me?
- Yes.
Listen, everybody.
Be calm... cooperate... and this will all be over in a minute.
Get the fuck down!
Well done.
All right, now, people...
I'm going to come around and collect your wallets.
You don't fucking talk.
You just throw them in the bag.
Are we clear?
I said, are we fucking clear?
Good. Now wallets out.
That's it.
Get the fuck down.
In the bag.
In the fucking bag!
I don't have nothing on me, man.
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.
Laura? Laura, tips.
- In the bag.
- Yeah.
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.
In the fucking bag.
Tidy up, tidy up.
That's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.
In the bag.
In the bag.
What's in the case?
My boss's dirty laundry.
Your boss makes you do his laundry?
When he wants it clean.
Sounds like a shit job.
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.
Open it.
Afraid I can't do that.
I didn't hear you.
Yes, you did.
What's going on?
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
Shoot him in the face.
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time...
I've had a gun pointed at me.
You don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.
Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!
Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of there!
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your goddamn business.
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.
It's no problem.
I got it under control.
Now I'm going to count to three.
If you don't open that case...
I'm going to unload in your fucking face.
We clear?
One... two...
- three.
- OK, Ringo.
You win.
It's yours.
Open it.
What is it?
Is that what I think it is?
Mm-hmm.
It's beautiful.
God damn it, what is it?
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!
Tell that fuckin' bitch to chill!
Be cool, Honey Bunny!
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Let go of him!
Chill!
Tell her it's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
- Promise her!
- I promise!
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.
All right, now, Yolanda!
We're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?
Don't you hurt him!
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
And what's Fonzie like?
Come on, Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?!
He's cool?
What?
- Cool.
Correctamundo!
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.
And when I count three...
I want you to let go of your gun... put your palms flat on the table... and sit your ass down.
But when you do it, you do it cool.
You ready?
One... two... three.
OK, now you let him go!
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.
Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
And when I get nervous,
I get scared.
And when motherfuckers get scared... that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
Just know, you hurt him, you die.
Well, that seems to be the situation.
But I don't want that, and you don't want that... and Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
Now... here's the situation.
Normally both your asses... would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken... but you happened to pull this shit... while I'm in a transitional period... and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case... to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
Vincent!
Be cool!
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!
We still just talking!
Come on, point the gun at me!
Point the gun at me!
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back and don't do a goddamn thing.
Tell her we're still cool.
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.
How we doing, baby?
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.
Just hang in there, baby.
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
I love you.
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.
I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
Which one is it?
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."
That's it.
That's my Bad Motherfucker.
Open it up. Take out the money.
Count it.
How much is there?
About $1,500.
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.
With the rest of those wallets and the register... that makes this a pretty successful little score.
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod $1,500... and I'll shoot him on general principle.
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!
He ain't gonna do a goddamn motherfuckin' thing.
Vince, shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
Come on, Yolanda, stay with me, baby.
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?
What?
Your life.
I'm givin' you that money... so I don't have to kill your ass.
You read the Bible, Ringo?
Not regularly, no.
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.
"Ezekiel" 25:17.
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...
"by the inequities of the selfish...
"and the tyranny of evil men.
"Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...
"shepherds the weak through the Valley of Darkness...
"for he is truly his brother's keeper...
"and the finder of lost children.
"And I will strike down upon thee...
"with great vengeance and furious anger...
"those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
"And you will know
I am the Lord...
"when I lay My vengeance upon you."
Now, I been sayin' that shit for years.
And if you heard it, that meant your ass.
I never gave much thought to what it meant.
I just thought it was some cold-blooded shit... to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.
But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice.
See, now I'm thinkin'... maybe it means you're the evil man... and I'm the righteous man... and Mr. Nine-millimeter here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass... in the Valley of Darkness.
Or it could mean... you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd... and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
Now, I'd like that.
But that shit ain't the truth.
The truth is... you're the weak... and I am the tyranny of evil men.
But I'm tryin', Ringo.
I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.
Go on.
I think we should be leaving now.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marrietta, Ga., in the Spring 1861.
There were two loves in his live.
His engine,
And--
"Fort Sumter has been fired upon."
"Then the war is here."
"Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist."
"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Johnnie Gray."
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him. He is more valuable to the South as an engineer."
"We can't use you."
"William Brown."
"Occupation?"
"Bartender."
"If you lose this war don't blame me."
"Did Johnnie enlist?"
"He didn't even get in line."
"He's a disgrace to the South.
"Why didn't you enlist?"
"They wouldn't take me."
"Please don't lie. I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later. In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner."
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters."
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat."
General Parker's victorious
Northern army advancing.
"There is only one man on that engine."
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines. You follow with the supply trains as planned."
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."
Heroes of the day.
"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."
"Occupation?"
"Soldier."
THE 400 BLOWS
This film is dedicated... to the memory of André Bazin
Doinel! Bring me that!
Indeed! Go to the corner!
1 minute left!
Quiet!
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!
Quiet!
Line heads, get ready!
I'll count to 3
3! Collect!
Collect in back!
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!
- What is it?
- He won't give it!
No favoritism!
Brown-noser!
Is everyone's paper in?
You may go!
Sorry! Not you!
Recess is a reward, not an obligation!
Here suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly... punished by a prof for a pin-up clad barely
So it's now forsooth, eye for eye, tooth for tooth!
Alright, champs, maybe you need a ref!
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!
3 days of rest will do you good!
Come look! This is funny!
What's so interesting there?
Take your seats!
Bravo!
We have a new Juvenal in our class!
But he can't tell an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...
Doinel, sit down! in all tenses of the indicative... conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!
I dirty the classroom walls... and misuse French versification
The Hare...
Doinel, go to the janitor and... get something to remove that nonsense... or else you'll lick it off!
Richer, who said you could change seats?
In the days when the bushes... the bushes... were aflame with flowers... bright red...
When already the dark tips...
When already... the dark tips... of my long ears... were seen... above my head...
In the still unripe rye...
I munched on... the leaves...
Pointing to the sky
One day... comma... weary I lay... in my den... with sleep-filled eyes...
When little Margot found me by surprise!
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!
Sure! The other guy!
True, she liked me... very much... my gentle mistress!
How good to me... so caring... such tenderness!
How she held me on her lap... and kissed me!
What fool whistled?
Confess or I'll punish anybody!
Right, Simonot?
I swear, sir!
It wasn't me!
And you're cowards!
What a class!
I've known morons but at least they didn't let it show
They hid in their corner
And you?
Call that clean! You've made it dirtier! Copy the poem!
Your parents'll pay
What'll France be like in 10 years?
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard
Even Mauricet!
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?
A department store
Did ya swipe the money from your dad or your ma?
Don't tell me ya don't go through their pockets!
And ya got me caught earlier!
Ya bastard!
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!
I'll never do it all tonight
That prof's a bastard
It's his job!
But before I'm drafted...
I'll bash his head in!
That I would have dirtied the classroom walls
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...
Where's the flour?
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it
No wonder you get such bad grades!
Get my slippers!
In the bedroom!
Under the bed!
I need some flour
Go get it at once!
Yes, Mama
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes
But for the little one, if I hadn't had a Caesarean... we wouldn't be talkin' now!
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!
In a rush, son?
I just got hell for some flour
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight
I'm gonna try it out Sunday
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!
I'm not in the mood!
I was hoping you were!
And my change?
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad
A storm's brewing!
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?
I need 1,000 francs
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300
Here's 100
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that
The scissors!
Where are the scissors?
It's not funny!
No homework now! It's time to eat
Right! Each thing has its time and place. That way, the cows're safe!
Is that a new pen?
I made a swap for it
You swap a lot lately!
What's that smell?
It's the fish
And how!
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot
Why?
For laughs!
You can clear the table now
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again
Her 4th in 3 years?
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!
And what about our kid during vacation?
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there
It's 8 months off!
Never too early to plan a vacation!
Don't pull so hard!
Great, huh?
Lions' Club...
What's all this?
Take it easy!
For Sunday's race... shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley or along the Oise?
On Sunday I rest
I'm going to see Huguette
But I'm the race organiser!
I'm sick of housework...
And dates in the afternoon!
I mean the edible kind!
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!
G'night!
You can be so stupid!
If you could only take a joke...
Your auto races are a waste of time!
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm
That I would have dirtied the classroom walls!
There's no socks around these holes!
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry
I gave you money for sheets for the kid's bed
He prefers his sleeping bag
Right, honey?
At least I'm warm in it
You still here?
Bye, Pa! Mama!
Don't rush so fast!
We'll get locked out and have to see the director
- No need to hurry!
- Why?
The prof said he won't let ya in
- He means it?
- He can't stand you
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen
Trust me... This way!
What'll we do now?
Follow me!
Put your satchel with mine
Antoine! He saw me!
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair
But he should be in school!
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!
So you're safe!
I'm going to school tomorrow... but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date
You can borrow it and copy it
But the handwriting?
Imitate your mother's
That'll be hard. It's angular
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!
- Bye!
- Bye!
I ask you to please... excuse... my son...
René... who was ill...
My son René!
It smells like something burnt!
That's downstairs
Set the table just for 2
Why? Is Mom gone?
She phoned me to say she'll be late tonight
Her boss needs her for the budget
So we'll cook and have a man-to-man dinner
She mentioned some eggs someplace
I know where they are
Did you study hard today?
What'd you do?
The hare
And the tortoise?
No, just questions about the hare
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me
You've got to speak up!
If not, you're out of the race
You've got to take the initiative in life
Have you thought of your mother's birthday?
It's the 17th
I hope you'll give her something
You hear me?
I know what you think
She's been hard on you lately but... she's a very nervous woman
Put yourself in her shoes!
She has her housework plus an afternoon job
And this place is too tiny
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place
In an office it's always the same story
Women are exploited and can't defend themselves
But she loves you! Oh shit!
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it
You know I can't stand lying
I put it in its place yesterday
It's not me!
It's crazy how things disappear!
It's not me
I'll ask your mother
It's time for bed
Don't forget the garbage
My boss drove me home
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!
That kind of overtime is paid cash!
No wonder you need to rest on Sunday!
Where's my Michelin?
No idea! The kid might know
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so
We'll put him in an orphanage... so I can have some peace!
We'll eat out till the end of the month!
How? I don't have a clean shirt!
You could at least do the collars
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!
I bought it second-hand
Go open the door
Maybe it's the gas man
They send a notice first
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?
Why?
He missed school yesterday
Ya hear that?
You don't seem surprised
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything
What'll my excuse be?
The bigger the lie, the better it works
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back... without an excuse
I can't make up a story like that
We mustn't go in together
Right. You go first
So there you are!
Extra homework made you sick, eh?
Your folks fell for it?
I'd like to see what kind of excuse you have
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one
You expect to get away with it like that?
It'd be too easy!
Sir, it's my mother
What about her?
She's just died
I'm sorry... I didn't know...
Was she ill?
Yes, sir
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers
Go join the others
And your excuse?
Never mind!
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
- ...than in the ass!
If you'd wash your ears you'd hear your prompter!
Up your'ear!
He's just trying to confuse me
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up
Than in the flowers...
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...
And incessant peril...
Than slavery...
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!
I knew it at home!
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!
I'm sorry...
Simonot!
The Hare...
Sit down!
He must be punished within the limits...
He's beyond all limits!
Only his parents can deal with such a mistake
We'll settle this tonight at home!
What'll you do?
After this I can't live with my parents any more
I've got to disappear
Mine've been through worse!
Yeah, but I want to live my own life
I'll write them a letter
- Right now?
- It's best that way
Where'll ya sleep?
I don't know. I don't care
I've got an idea
Be at the Pigalle fountain in 1 hour
OK
It's my uncle's old print shop
The floor collapsed under the heavy machines
Will it collapse again?
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow
It's real heavy!
Go for a walk till midnight
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK
Dear Parents... I understand the seriousness of my lie
Why'd he kill me instead of you?
A matter of preference!
Life between us is impossible
So I'm going to try my luck in the city or elsewhere
I want to become a man
When I see you again, we'll have a full explanation
I close with kisses... Antoine
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him
He gets on my nerves!
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!
- What's his name?
- I've no idea
Forget it, kid
But I saw him first!
Understand me?
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!
Parents spoil 'em rotten!
Chabrol, want some help?
The last question is even easier as if you're lisping
I can't. Not everyone can use their tongue like you said
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!
Impudent!
Now you!
Answer me!
Doinel?
Frochot, take over until I return
We don't know how to handle him!
Madam, you don't deserve such a rascal
My poor baby!
Where'd you spend the night?
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?
I don't care if he's last so long as he behaves!
Fine!
Maybe it's... glandular
You mustn't catch cold
And now to bed!
I'm not sleepy
You'll be better off in our bed
You know, I was your age once
Kids forget that!
I was stubborn and wouldn't confide in my parents
So I wrote everything in a diary
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you
At your age I went on vacation with a shepherd boy I liked but... they caught us! Ma made me swear not to see him again... and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!
What did you mean in your letter... about having a full explanation?
I meant about my bad behavior and why I don't study hard
So, tell me...
I don't know how to listen... so I want to quit and earn my own living
That's crazy! You've no idea!
I so regret not going beyond high school!
Your dad has only an elementary diploma
It hampers him!
I know school teaches lots of useless stuff
Algebra and science don't... help many people
But French! You always need it for writing letters!
Let's share another secret, OK?
On your next French essay... if you're among... the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!
But don't tell your father!
Suddenly the dying man rose up on his fists... and shot a lightning glance at his terrified children
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered
His face brightened
A breath wafted his face, making it sublime. He lifted his fist... and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...
Eureka! I have found it!
Describe a major event you witnessed and which concerned you personally
Eureka! I have found it!
The Death... of My Grandfather
The monkey's finally laid the new typist!
She's made the most of it!
She got herself named executive secretary
She fills all the requirements!
Gotta be careful of her now because of pillow talk!
When she was on the road, I told her how to juggle her expense account
Instead of that, she stayed in 3-star hotels!
Say, I still haven't found my Michelin hotel guide
One of you has moved it
Oh, you and your Michelin!
I don't like mysteries
What's on the stove?
Nothing! I'm sure!
Put it out! Don't yell!
Get some water!
Ya blockhead!
What made ya light a candle in there?
It was for Balzac!
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something
What? A bonus for fire damage?
Ya need more than a candle!
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!
For as long as you're living here, you'll do as I say!
If not, it means military academy!
Know what that is?
You'll find out!
And you'll toe the line!
Know what we'll do for a change of air?
We'll all go to the movies tonight!
Fine! A great method of education!
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad
Listen, Julian... Trust us!
He wants to surprise us
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!
But the Gaumont Theatre doesn't like arsonists!
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry
They're not in season!
She really had... how shall I say... she had lots of...
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny
Not funny? But it had depth!
- What?
- Depth!
- The movie!
- Yeah...
It's time for bed
Beddy-bye!
It's Satan's general and his staff!
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?
Back to our happy hearth... but a little smoky!
The garbage, honey!
I hope I won't regret trying to win him over
Doinel!
If your essay is first today it's because I've decided... to rank them by starting from the bottom
Your search for the absolute led you straight to a zero
For you who don't know Balzac... it concerns A Gloomy Affair
Doinel has the right to take the death of a relative as his subject... although we know he easily sacrifices his dear ones whenever convenient
I didn't copy, sir!
Listen to this!
Suddenly the dying man rose up... and shot a lightning glance at his terrified children
His hair stood on end and his eyebrows arched
His face brightened with a sublime look
He shouted Archimedes' famous word... Eureka! I've found it!
Well, I found it too!
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!
Take your essay at once to the principal
Colombel, go with him
And stay out till the end of the term!
What's with you?
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!
Want to be expelled?
That's OK
Such impudence!
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!
Out!
That's illegal!
I'll show you who makes the laws here!
Did you take him?
- He ran away.
- Ran away?
I slugged him and ran
And you?
He threw me out till after Christmas
Now I really can't go home.
Dad said he'd put me in an academy
- What's that?
- Something military
You'd have a uniform and a future
No thanks!
If only it were the Navy!
I'd like to see the ocean.
I've seen the Channel, the Atlantic... and the Mediterranean but not the North Sea
Stay at my house. We'll manage!
Holy cow! A horse!
It's my dad's. A souvenir!
What a huge place!
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here
And your parents?
Never here! Mom drinks and Dad is always... at the races.
This place is wide open
We need to start a business
Yeah, we need money
But we need some to start with
In that case...
I'll use part of my inheritance
Quiet! Mom may be around
Anyone here?
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school
She makes sure her hours never coincide with mine
She must be up to something
Where's the fruit?
Here!
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!
Yeah, I know, Inspector, you'll lock me up for life
But drop by Duely's around 8:00
Ya might meet a pal with sharp teeth
I'm thirsty!
It's already empty!
Come on! Play!
You threw a 12?
It's my old man!
Help shake the blankets!
That's enough!
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!
A real gambling den!
I'll deduct 3 cigars from your allowance
Bucephalus is not for your junk!
He's worth a million!
A work of art!
I'll never give him up until the last minute!
Now turn out the lights and go to sleep!
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!
- Not bad!
- By god!
Great!
Give me your Michelin
A million'd be great!
My dad would kill me because of that horse
With a million we'll find a beach... open a boat business and no one'll bother us!
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!
Ma pawned all our stuff
- How much?
- 10o/o
- 1,000 right away.
- When you come back!
You sure trust me!
Give us back our typewriter!
Runnin' away?
- I thought you'd gone this way.
- Sure!
They wouldn't take it!
Then give it back
- Gimme 500 for the time I spent.
- We're broke
Ya must have something!
300 and that'll do it
No! Give it back!
I don't work for free!
I'll keep it as a deposit
It's ours!
Give it back or I'll slug ya!
Hands off!
It's no more yours than it is mine!
- Let's ask that cop.
- Shut up!
Keep the damn thing! Shit-heads!
- I'm tired of carrying it!
- It's your turn
Dad'll surely think I swiped it
- It was your idea.
- Yours!
- I don't care. I quit!
- Ya lost your mind?
I gotta take it back to Dad's office but...
I'll wear a hat. If the guard sees me, he'll think it's a man
Take it back for me!
No way! It wasn't my idea!
You're a bastard!
I'll put my hat on
Wait for me by the store
Why, you're the Doinel boy!
Put that down!
Your papa's gonna love this!
And I get hell for not watching things enough! This'll cost ya!
And don't try to pull a Houdini on me!
I know the ropes!
I don't like smarties like you
Mr. Doinel? I'm sorry to call during your meeting
You'll have to come upstairs
I got a surprise for you... but not a nice one!
Don't touch that hat!
You think I'm takin' ya to a party?
The joke's over! Your ma and I wanna be able to sleep nights
Take a good look at your pal
You won't see him for a while!
Maybe this'll set your head right.
It can't go on like this!
If I'd done this, my dad would've laid me flat
Is the captain in?
We've tried everything... kindness, persuasion, punishment... but we've never beaten him!
At times the good old methods...
Yes, but we're not like that
- We left him free.
- Maybe too free!
I wouldn't say so
But since we both work, you know how it is
Yes, I'm a father too
At times it's hard to know what to do
If only he'd confide in us!
We talk to him, his mind's elsewhere
You think he's listening?
Look how I found him!
Who knows what's on his mind?
Cabanel!
Please take this boy's statement
- Vagrancy and theft!
- Right, boss
Come on!
So what's your decision?
For now, we can't have him at home.
He'd run off again
If you could put him somewhere under surveillance... like in the country and put him to work
He won't do anything in school
We could try an Observation Center
They're well organized now, with wood and metal workshops
That would do him good
If they have room!
You'll have ask for a paternal correction... so Probational Education can take charge of him
He'll go before the juvenile court judge tomorrow
- You or your wife should be there.
- Alright!
- Anyone see you enter the building?
- No
...hereby... declares he entered the building surreptitiously...
...one typewriter
Sign here!
- Charles!
- Yeah?
He's yours!
Come on!
That way!
- He's yours. I'm goin' home.
- OK
- What'd you do?
- Ran away from home
And you?
Me...
The gals're here!
I've seen cleaner precincts in movies
I've seen dirtier
I've seen cheerier!
Move!
The chariot's here!
Put on your jacket!
Tie, belt, shoelaces...
Empty your pockets!
Sign there!
Sign here!
We could try taking him back but... he'd have to promise to change completely
If you could frighten him...
That's not my role
We've no control over him!
Maybe you try to control him only intermittently
Is the boy often left alone on the weekends... at home?
My husband belongs to a car racing club
So we sometimes leave the boy at home... but he hates sports!
He prefers going... to movies and ruining his eyes
And your husband? He's his son!
No. He married me when the boy was a baby
Very honorable!
I shouldn't have said that
On the contrary!
I think it's best we send the boy... to an observation center
One near the seashore?
We don't run vacation camps!
I'll do my best with whatever is available
We'll keep him 2 or 3 months while I investigate his case
Then we'll reach a decision
This processing is bound to do him good
- Goodbye, Judge.
- Goodbye, Madam
Juvenile Delinquency Center
- What're you in for?
- And you?
- I slipped up!
- I swiped a typewriter
A typewriter? Not very bright!
They've all got serial numbers!
See that big guy?
He swiped automobile tires
At home every time I'd cry... my dad would imitate my crying with his violin... just to tease me
One day I got fed up and I slugged him
I'd kill my old man if he did that
Who's that guy?
He ran away last week.
He got caught!
Running away's not forbidden, but getting caught is!
What's going on?
Line up!
What're you up to?
Show me your bread!
Alright...
You bit into yours!
Bring your bread and dish over here
Left or right?
Quiet!
I bet you'd get caught and I won!
I don't care!
For 5 days I had so much fun...
I'll do it again first chance I get
What're you up to?
Kanayan! To the psychologist!
If she drops a pencil, pick it up... without looking at her legs or it'll go in your file
- What file?
- It says what they think of you... the judge, doctor, even your parents' neighbors
I know my file by heart
I'm psychomotorally unstable with perverse tendencies
What if I say some nonsense?
You'll go to the booby hatch and that'll send you around the bend!
Why'd you return the typewriter?
I couldn't sell it.
I didn't know what to do
I was scared... so I took it back
I don't know why
And you stole 10,000 francs from your grandmother?
She asked me over for her birthday
She was old and didn't eat much
She hung on to her money but didn't need it. She was gonna die
I knew the hiding place so I swiped some
I knew she'd never miss it
And she never did!
She gave me a very nice book that day
My mother would always go through my pockets and... my pants were on the bed that night... so she came in and swiped the money...
'cause the next day it was gone
Then she made me confess
I'd taken it from my grandma
So she took away the book
Grandma had given me
One day I asked to read it and... found out she'd sold it
Your parents say you always lie
I lie... once in a while
At times, if I told the truth they wouldn't believe me!
So I tell lies
Why don't you love your mother?
At first I was placed with a foster mother
When the money ran out,
I went to Grandma's
Then she got old and couldn't keep me so...
I went to live with my folks but I was already 8
I realized Mom didn't like me much
She'd nag at me for little insignificant things
Then there were fights at home
I heard... that when my mother had me she was a bachelor mother
Once she fought with Grandma and I found out... she wanted an abortion
So I was born thanks to Grandma
Have you ever slept with a girl?
No, but I know some pals who have and they said... if I really wanted to,
I should go to rue St-Denis
So I went and... asked a few girls and they gave me hell
I got scared and left
But I went back a few times
A guy noticed me in the street and said What're you doin' here?
He was a North African. I explained and he said he knew one who'd go... with young guys and all that
He took me to her hotel... but she wasn't there that day
We waited an hour or 2... then I left
No, I came alone
That way?
Your personal letter hurt your father a lot
You're naïve to think he wouldn't show it to me
In spite of things we're a solid couple
I've known hard times but it wasn't smart to remind him about it
Didn't he give you a name?
We were ready... to take you back home but now it's impossible... due to the gossip and your talk to the neighbors
I didn't say a thing!
But I'm used to it! I've had idiots attacking me all my life
That's all I have to say to you
Don't play the martyr!
Your father says he doesn't care what happens to you
You can go to a trade school
You wanted a job?
You'll see how much fun a foundry can be!

Jenny and me were just like peas and carrots again.
She showed me around
and even introduced me to some of her new friends.
Shut that blind, man!
And get your white ass away from that window.
Don't you know we in a war here?
Don't you know we in a war here?
He's cool.
He's one of us.
Let me tell you about us.
Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our black leaders, rape our women, and destroy our black communities.
Who's the baby killer?
This is my good friend
I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley, and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.
We are here to offer protection and help for all those who need our help, because we, the Black Panthers, are against the war in Vietnam.
We are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them.
We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities.
We are against these racist and imperial acts...
~ And I gave her the gun ~
~ I shot her ~
Forrest!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Forrest!
Stop it! Stop it!
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle!
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.
Come on, Forrest.
Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
He doesn't mean it when he does things like this.
I would never hurt you, Jenny.
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.
I wanted to be your boyfriend.
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
You look handsome in it.
You do.
You know what?
What?
I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.
Me, too, Forrest.
We walked around all night, Jenny and me,
just talkin'.
She told me about all the traveling she'd done
and how she discovered ways to expand her mind
and learn how to live in harmony...
which must be out west somewhere,
'cause she made it all the way to California.
~ Love one another right now ~
Hey.
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?
I'll go.
Far out!
It was a very special night
for the two of us.
I didn't want it to end.
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
I have to, Forrest.
Jenny?
Things got a little out of hand.
It's just this war and that lying son of a bitch Johnson and...
I would never hurt you.
You know that.
Know what I think?
I think... you should go home to Greenbow,
Alabama!
Forrest, we have very different lives, you know.
I want you... to have this.
Forrest, I can't keep this.
I got it... just by doing what you told me to do.
Why are you so good to me?
You're my girl.
I'll always be your girl.
~ To everything, turn, turn, turn ~
~ There is a season, turn, turn, turn ~
~ And a time to every purpose ~
~ Under heaven ~
And just like that,
she was gone out of my life again.
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,
but instead they decided
the best way for me to fight the Communists
was to play Ping-Pong,
so I was in the Special Services,
traveling around the country,
cheering up wounded veterans and showing 'em how to play Ping-Pong.
I was so good that some years later,
the army decided I should be
on the all-American Ping-Pong team.
We were the first Americans to visit the land of China
in a million years or something.
Somebody said world peace was in our hands,
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity, famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.
Here he is, Forrest Gump.
Right here.
Gump, have a seat.
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
Welcome home.
Can you tell us, um,
what was China like?
In the land of China...
people hardly got nothin'at all.
No possessions?
And in China, they never go to church.
No religion, too?
Oh.
Hard to imagine.
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.
Some years later,
that nice young man from England
was on his way home to see his little boy
and was signing some autographs.
For no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.
They gave you... the congressional Medal of Honor.
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.
Lieutenant Dan!
They gave you... the congressional
Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir.
They surely did.
They gave you, an imbecile, a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself in front of the whole damn country, the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir.
Well... that... that's just perfect!
Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that...
Goddamn bless America.
Hey, hey!
Whoa...
Oh, God, whoa!
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!
Lieutenant Dan!
Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel
and because he didn't have no legs,
he spent most of his time exercising his arms.
Make a right. Take a right!
Hey!
Ah, ah!
What do you do here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?
I'm living off the government tit.
[Honk]
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?
I'm walking here!
Ah, get out!
Come on. Go, go, go!
[Singing Silent Night]
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.
You have a great year, and hurry home.
God bless you.
Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for Him, sir.
That's all these cripples down at the V. A...
That's all they ever talk about.
Jesus this and Jesus that. Ha.
Have I... found Jesus?
They even had a priest come and talk to me.
He said God is listening, but I have to help myself.
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,
I'll get to walk beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.
Did you hear what I said?
Walk... beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.
Well... kiss my crippled ass.
God is listening?
What a crock of shit.
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.
Oh?
Well... before you go... why don't you get your ass down to the corner and get us more Ripple?
Yes, sir.
We're at approximately
45th Street in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
This is the site of the old...
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?
Shrimping boats.
Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?
I got to buy me one soon as I have some money.
I promised Bubba in Vietnam that as soon as the war was over, we'd be partners.
He'd be the captain and I'd be his first mate.
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.
A shrimp boat captain.
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
Now hear this!
Private Gump here is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.
The day that you are a shrimp boat captain,
I will come and be your first mate.
Ha ha ha!
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain, that's the day
I'm an astronaut!
Danny, what are you complaining about?
Danny, how you doing, huh?
Mr. Hot Wheels!
Who's your friend?
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.
This is cunning Carla and long-limbs Lenore.
So where you been, babycakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.
You should have been here for Christmas,
'cause Tommy bought a free round and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.
Hey! Hey, we was just there!
That's like Times Square.
Don't you just love New Year's?
You can start all over.
Everybody gets a second chance.
It's funny...
but in the middle of all that fun,
I began to think about Jenny,
wondering how she was spending her New Year's night
out in California.
~ Don't you love her ways? ~
~ Tell me what you say ~
~ Don't you love her madly? ~
~ Want to meet her daddy? ~
~ Don't you love her face? ~
~ Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door? ~
9... 8...
7... 6...
5... 4...
3... 2...
1!
[Crowd]
Happy new year!
[Toot]
~ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ~
~ And never brought to mind ~
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!
~ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ~
~ In days of auld lang syne ~
~ Together we stand ~
~ Divided we fall ~
~ Come on now, people, let's ~
~ Get on the ball ~
~ And work together ~
~ Come on, come on ~
~ Let's work together ~
Oh! What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?
What's his problem?
Did you lose your packet in the war or something?
Is your friend stupid or something?
What did you say?
I said is your friend stupid or something?
Don't call him stupid!
Hey, don't push her!
You shut up!
Don't you ever call him stupid!
Come on, baby, why you being so upset, huh?
Get your goddamned clothes and get the hell out of here!
You should be in a sideshow.
You're so pathetic!
Get out of here!
You big guy!
Loser. You freak!
Oh, no. No.
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.
She tastes like cigarettes.
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things you just can't change.
He didn't want to be called crippled
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.
Happy new year, Gump.
The U.S. Ping-Pong team
met with President Nixon today...
Wouldn't you know it?
A few months later, they invited me and the Ping-Pong team to visit the White House.
So I went... again.
And I met the president of the United States again.
Only this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.
Are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?
Where are you staying?
It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new. Very modern.
I'll have my people take care of it.
Security.
Yeah. Sir, you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way.
The lights are off and they must be looking for a fuse box,
'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake.
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.
Thank you. Good night.
Therefore...
I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.
Vice President Ford
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.
Forrest Gump.
Yes, sir!
As you were.
I have your discharge papers.
Service is up, son.
Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?
For the army, it does.
And just like that,
my service in the United States Army was over.
So I went home.
I'm home, Mama.
I know. I know.
Louise, he's here.
Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,
but Mama had all sorts of visitors.
We've had all sorts of visitors.
Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.
One man even left a check for $25,000 if you'd be agreeable to saying you like using their paddle.
I only like using my own paddle.
Hi, Miss Louise.
Hey, Forrest.
I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while, see if it grows on you.
That Mama, she sure was right.
It's funny how things work out.
I didn't stay home for long
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
and I always try to keep my promise,
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family.
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.
I guess.
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.
Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.
I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out.
I'm taking $24,562.47 that I got, that's left
after a new haircut and a new suit
and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.
Tell me something.
Are you stupid or something?
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
That's what's left after me saying,
"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle," which everybody knows isn't true, but Mama said it was just a little white lie, so it wasn't hurting nobody.
So anyway,
I'm putting all that on gas, ropes, and new nets and a brand-new shrimping boat.
Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,
but you know what I found out?
Shrimping is tough.
I only caught five.
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.
Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one
I could think of,
the most beautiful name in the wide world.
~ Do a little dance ~
~ Make a little love ~
~ Get down tonight ~
~ Get down tonight ~
~ Do a little dance ~
~ Make a little love ~
~ Get down tonight ~
~ Whoo ~
~ Get down tonight... ~
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,
but I thought about her a lot.
I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.
~ Oh, and the bird you cannot change ~
~ And this bird you cannot change ~
~ Lord knows I can't change ~
~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~
I thought about Jenny all the time.
Hey!
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.
Yes, I know that.
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself... and...
I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain, that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.
I'm a man of my word.
O.K.
But don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you "sir."
No, sir.
It's my boat.
I have a feeling if we head due east, we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.
Take a left!
Which way?
Over there!
They're over there!
Get on the wheel and take a left.
O.K.
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left!
Left!
That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!
Ha ha!
That's where we'll find them.
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
O.K., so I was wrong.
Well, how are we going to find them?
Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.
~ So pray that ~
~ I'm homeward bound... ~
So I went to church every Sunday.
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,
though I think he left the praying up to me.
No shrimp.
Where the hell's this God of yours?
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that
'cause right then God showed up.
[Dan]
You'll never sink this boat!
Now, me, I was scared,
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.
Come on!
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!
It's time for a showdown!
You and me!
I'm right here!
Come and get me!
Ha ha! Ha ha!
You'll never sink... this... boat!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday, destroying nearly everything in its path.
And as in other towns up and down the coast,
Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.
This reporter has learned,
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.
[Gump]
After that, shrimping was easy.
~ There will be great bounty ~
~ Oh, my God... ~
Since people still needed them shrimps
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all and we were the only boat left standing,
Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got.
We got a whole bunch of boats.
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.
We even have hats that say "Bubba Gump" on them.
Bubba Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.
Hold on there, boy.
Are you telling me you're the owner of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?
Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time, but that tops them all.
Ha ha ha ha!
We were sitting next to a millionaire.
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story, and you tell it so well, with such enthusiasm.
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
Yes, I would.
That's him right there.
Let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest...
I never thanked you for saving my life.
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.
[Gunshots]
For the second time in 17 days,
President Ford escaped possible assassination today.
Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.
Forrest has a phone call.
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.
He is indisposed at the moment.
His mama's sick.
Where's Mama?
She's upstairs.
Hi, Forrest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, all right.
Sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?
What's the matter, Mama?
I'm dying, Forrest.
Come on in, sit down over here.
Why are you dying, Mama?
It's my time.
It's just my time.
Oh, now... don't you be afraid, sweetheart.
Death is just a part of life.
Something we're all destined to do.
I didn't know it, but I was destined to be your mama.
I did the best I could.
You did good.
Well... I happen to believe you make your own destiny.
You have to do the best with what God gave you.
What's my destiny, Mama?
You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.
You never know what you're going to get.
Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.
I will miss you, Forrest.
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.
And that's all I have to say about that.
Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?
There'll be another one along shortly.
Now, because I had been a football star and war hero and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain and a college graduate, the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job.
So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,
though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.
So then I got a call from him
saying we don't have to worry about money no more, and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."
~ I've got a new hope... ~
Now Mama said there's only so much fortune
a man really needs,
and the rest is just for showing off.
So I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare Gospel Church...
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...
and even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.
You know what?
She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
That smells wonderful.
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,
I cut that grass for free.
But at nighttime when there was nothing to do
and the house was all empty,
I'd always think of Jenny.
And then... she was there.
Hello, Forrest.
Hello, Jenny.
Jenny came back and stayed with me.
Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go,
or maybe it was because she was so tired
'cause she went to bed and slept and slept
like she hadn't slept in years.
It was wonderful having her home.
Every day we'd take a walk,
and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,
and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.
How could you do this?
Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.
Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,
and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get
in the wide world.
They're made just for running.
~ Carry me home to see my kin ~
And she even showed me how to dance.
~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~
~ And I think it's a sin ~
~ Sweet home Alabama... ~
Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...
and it was the happiest time in my life.
You done watching it?
Mm-hmm.
I'm going to bed.
Will you marry me?
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.
You would, Forrest.
But you won't marry me.
You don't want to marry me.
Why don't you love me, Jenny?
I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.
Jenny...
Forrest, I do love you.
Where are you running off to?
I'm not running.
That day,
for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.
So I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.
[TV] President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...
And when I got there,
I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.
Now, I figured since I'd run this far,
maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.
And that's what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.
I ran clear to the ocean.
And when I got there,
I figured since
I'd gone this far,
might as well turn around, just keep on going.
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since
I'd gone this far...
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.
When I had to go... you know...
I went.
And so... you just ran.
Yeah.
~ Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels ~
~ Lookin' back at the years gone by ~
~ Like so many summer fields ~
~ In '65, I was 17 ~
~ And runnin' up one on one ~
~ I don't know where I'm runnin' now ~
~ I'm just runnin' on ~
~ Runnin' on ~
~ Runnin' on empty ~
~ Runnin' on ~
~ Runnin' dry ~
~ Runnin' on... ~
I'd think a lot...
about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.
But most of all,
I thought about Jenny.
I thought about her a lot.
For more than two years,
a man named Forrest Gump,
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep,
has been running across America.
Charles Cooper brings you this report.
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,
Forrest Gump, the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
is about to cross the Mississippi River again today.
I'll be damned. Forrest?
Sir, where are you running?
Are you doing this for world peace?
Are you doing this for the homeless?
Are you running for women's rights?
The environment?
They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that running
for no particular reason.
Why are you doing this?
I just felt like running.
I just felt like runnin'.
That's you.
I can't believe it's really you.
Now... for some reason, what I was doing seemed to... make sense to people.
It was like an alarm went off in my head.
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.
Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.
So I got company.
And after that,
I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.
Somebody later told me it gave people hope.
Now...
Now, I don't know anything about that,
but some of those people asked me
if I could help them out.
I was wondering if you might help me.
I'm in the bumper sticker business.
I need a good slogan, and since you've been so inspirational,
I thought you might be able to help me...
Whoa, man! You just ran through a big pile of dog shit!
It happens.
What, shit?
Sometimes.
And some years later,
I heard that that fella
did come up with a bumper sticker slogan
and made a lot of money off of it.
Another time,
I was running along.
Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.
[Horn Honks]
Have a nice day.
Some years later, I found out
that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.
He made a lot of money.
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.
My mama always said,
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on. "
And I think that's what my running was all about.
I had run for three years...
two months...
14 days, and 16 hours.
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.
I'm pretty tired.
Think I'll go home now.
Now what are we supposed to do?
And just like that...
my runnin'days was over.
So I went home to Alabama.
[TV]
Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...
[Gunshots]
Five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown, would-be assassin.
The president was shot in the chest...
I picked up the mail.
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny wondering if I could come down to Savannah and see her, and that's what I'm doing here.
Uh-huh.
She saw me on TV... running.
I'm supposed to go on the number 9 bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left to 1947 Henry Street... apartment 4.
Why, you don't need to take a bus.
Henry Street is just five or six blocks... down that way.
Down that way?
Down that way.
It was nice talking to you.
[Horn Honks]
I hope everything works out for you!
Hey!
Forrest!
How you doin'?
Come in! Come in!
I got your letter.
Oh, I was wondering about that.
This your house?
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.
It's nice.
You got air-conditioning.
Uh...
Thank you.
I ate some.
I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook of... of your clippings and... everything. There you are.
Yes, I got you running.
I ran a long way.
It's a long time.
There...
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.
Um...
I just...
I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you 'cause...
I was messed up... for a long time, and...
[Knock On Door]
Yoo-hoo!
Hey!
Hi.
Hey, you.
This is my old friend from Alabama.
How do you do?
[Jenny] Next week my schedule changes, so I can...
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.
O.K. Thanks.
This is my very good friend Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi?
Hello, Mr. Gump.
Hello.
Can I go watch TV now?
Yes. Just keep it low.
You're a mama, Jenny.
I'm a mama.
His name's Forrest.
Like me!
I named him after his daddy.
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?
You're his daddy, Forrest.
Hey...
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.
There's nothing you need to do.
You didn't do anything wrong.
O.K.?
Isn't he beautiful?
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
But... is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.
Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him.
What are you watching?
Bert and Ernie.
Forrest...
I'm sick.
What, do you have a cough due to a cold?
I have some kind of virus, and the doctors, they don't know what it is, and there isn't anything they can do about it.
You could come home with me.
Jenny, you and... little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow.
I'll take care of you if you're sick.
Would you marry me, Forrest?
O.K.
[Man]
Please take your seats.
Forrest?
It's time to start.
Hi.
Your tie.
Lieutenant Dan.
Lieutenant Dan.
Hello, Forrest.
You got new legs.
New legs!
Yeah. I got new legs.
Custom-made.
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.
Magic legs.
This... is my fiancée.
Susan.
Lieutenant Dan.
Hi, Forrest.
Lieutenant Dan... this is my Jenny.
Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your wife?
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband?
And so I pronounce you man and wife.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Forrest... were you scared in Vietnam?
Yes.
Well, l...
I don't know.
Sometimes it would stop raining
long enough for the stars to come out...
and then it was nice.
It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou.
There was always a million sparkles on the water...
like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,
it looked like there were two skies
one on top of the other.
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...
I couldn't tell
where heaven stopped and the earth began.
It's so beautiful.
I wish I could've been there with you.
You were.
I love you.
[Gump]
You died on a Saturday morning.
And I had you placed here under our tree.
And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
Mama... always said that dyin' was a part of life.
I sure wish it wasn't.
Little Forrest is... doing just fine.
"But..."
About to start school again soon,
and...
and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.
I make sure he... combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day.
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.
He's really good.
Uh, Forrest, you go.
Uhh!
We fish a lot.
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.
You'd be so proud of him.
I am.
He, uh, wrote you a... a letter.
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you.
Jenny...
I don't know if Mama was right or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.
I don't know... if we each have a... destiny... or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze... but l... I think... maybe it's both.
Maybe both get happening at the same time.
But I miss you, Jenny.
If there's anything you need...
I won't be far away.
[Birds Chirping]
Here's your bus.
O.K.
Hey...
I know this.
I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell because Grandma used to read it to you.
My favorite book.
Here we are.
Hey... here you go.
Hey, Forrest... don't...
I want to tell you
I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll be right here when you get back.
[Pop]
You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
Dismount!
Your name?
José Lizarabengoa, e! Navarrés, reporting for duty, sir.
- The Colonel will see you. Follow me.
- Thank you, sir.
José Lizarabengoa, e! Navarrés, reporting for duty, sir.
My duty and pleasure, Don Jose, to welcome you to our regiment.
Thank you, sir.
No doubt you've heard that life is pleasant in this regiment, that it's a fashionable catch-all for young men of good family with no talents to speak of, that we're called "The Gay Policemen," because we do little more than stand guard here and there a few hours a day and keep the peace, such as it is, in Seville.
- The rest of the time you may have heard...
- No, sir.
The rest of the time is spent in the consumption of great quantities of wine and gambling and making love to the girls from the cigarette factory.
There are approximately 200 of these girls, and the factory is next door to the barracks.
A great convenience and a blessing for the Dragoons.
Yes, sir.
You may have heard these things, and they are true.
Let me inform you, however, that a young man willing to work and to maintain a degree of integrity, sobriety and honour has a bright future in this regiment.
We need a few like you here.
Your record is good.
You Navarrasians are hard-working, moral, proud.
We need a few like you here.
- I hope you're ambitious.
- Yes, sir.
I've heard that in Seville, a promotion in the Dragoons is a step toward a government position.
A good thing to keep in mind.
Have you ever been in Seville before?
Do you know the city?
- No, sir.
- You are relieved of duties for 48 hours.
Look about the town, familiarise yourself with it.
The people here in Andalusia are a different breed from your Northerners.
- Look them over.
- Thank you, sir.
Dismissed.
There is nothing so good to the taste as a thing that's been warmed by the Spanish sun.
Well, not only is he beautiful, but music comes out of him.
-It is just a watch. It chimes.
- Too bad.
I thought for a minute you had wonderful possibilities.
It's just a watch. See?
Too bad.
But maybe we can be friends, anyway.
Would you like a bite of my orange, little soldier?
Thank you.
On the second thought, perhaps it would not be proper.
After all, we haven't been introduced.
I am José Lizarabengoa,
I just arrived in Seville, sefiorita.
Sefiorita? Me'?
You have just arrived in Seville!
- Where did you come from?
- From Navarre.
I've heard that the men from Navarre wear little blue berets, tell big black lies and don't know how to love a woman.
I've always wanted to find out for myself whether this was just gossip, or...
Look at them. The bride.
They paid out their last peseta to get rid of her, but it was worth it.
The bride.
She'll hate him, but she'll cling to him like a leech.
There's a payo wife for you.
And the fine groom.
In a week, he will be beating her.
- There's a payo marriage for you.
- Shut up, you!
You talk that way because nobody would marry a gypsy like you.
No? I could marry any man in Seville
I wanted to.
But I would rather be dead, do you hear?
I would rather be dead than be the stale wife of a spiritless payo!
Manuelito, remember me, little pig of a payo?
I told you she'd catch you. Little estzipido.
My oranges. Thief!
My oranges. You stole my oranges.
Those are my oranges.
The thief, he stole my oranges. Stop him!
Thief! My oranges!
The thief stole my oranges. Catch him!
I hope you find who you are looking for, José.
I'm not looking for anyone.
I don't know what you mean.
I've noticed you for two days now.
You search among these girls as though you're looking for a long lost relative.
Did the gypsies carry off your baby sister many, many years ago?
- Why did you use that word?
- What word?
-"Gypsy." I thought you said "gypsy."
- I did.
I suppose there's quite a few of them in the town.
Gypsies?
I suppose so.
There are quite a few everywhere.
- Why?
- No reason.
Do any gypsy girls work in that factory?
One. Just one.
But she comes and goes.
One never knows...
What time is it?
- I lost my watch a couple of days ago.
- That's too bad. I was just...
Carmencita!
Carmencita.
Carmen.
Carmen, I've been looking for two days for you.
For two days, Carmencita.
I inquired at the factory, and you were absent.
You weren't at Lillas Pastia's.
What have you been doing?
- Sunning myself.
- I'm going on duty right now, but if you meet me later, maybe we can have a bottle of wine at Lillas Pastia's.
No.
Forgive me. This is my new friend,
Don Jose. This is Carmen.
It is no use bothering with him, Carmen.
Don José has better things to think about than a pretty woman.
Better things?
What are better things?
Must you roll your eyes at every man?
Even the Colonel?
Such an important man might be very useful, if he...
My eyes are my own to send where I please.
Must I tell you again?
No one tells Carmen's eyes where to go or how to behave but Carmen!
-8:00 at Lillas Pastia's.
- I'll be there, Carmencita.
I was thinking, otherwise you wouldn't know when 8:00 arrived.
- Is that the watch you told me you lost?
- She must have found it somewhere.
How did she know it was yours?
Had you seen her before?
Well, a couple of days ago, she brushed against me while I was...
Then she stole it from you.
Gypsies will always steal anything they can get their hands on.
I don't know why I bother with that girl.
She's bad all the way through.
She lies as easily as other people drink water.
She is a liar, a thief and a cheat, has no more manners than my great aunt's cat.
She's really awful.
But I'd sell my soul to hear her say just once she loves me.
- Dirty gypsy trash!
- She is a disgrace to the town.
She laughed at my wedding and made dirty remarks at my Manuelito.
- Did you see what she did?
- See what she's done to the milk!
I spit in your milk and the milk of your old turtle of a mother, and at the poor excuse of a woman who married Manuelito.
Who did he marry? Me! Not you.
Gypsy garbage. Nobody would.
Out of the way. Out of the way.
What's going on here?
I'm dying. She killed me.
Bring a priest, I beg you, bring a priest.
I am dying!
What happened?
Quiet!
-It was the gypsy.
- She done it! I see her do it!
- Call the guard!
- Yes, sir.
Look, look at my face. She cut me.
I didn't say a word, and she cut me.
- I am dead! I am dying!
- Get her to the doctor.
May all your children be squint-eyed females and may they all grow up to swing from the gallows!
Now then. What started all this?
Quiet!
They called each other names until I thought my ears would drop off, and then that one took a knife from her stocking and zip zap.
Don't believe a word they say.
All these filthy people are against me.
Guard!
Haul her. Take the gypsy to the magistrate.
She almost cut that woman's head off.
I hold you responsible.
Yes, sir.
I'm ready to go now, soldier.
Please take me away from here.
Where are you taking me, sefior e! Navarrés?
- To the magistrate.
- To the magistrate?
He will send me to prison.
I can't go to prison.
A gypsy dies in prison, and I have no money for a bribe.
In this city, you rot in prison without money for a bribe.
I know. Believe me, I know. I have a friend who's in prison right this very minute.
That's why I'm here in Seville, working my fingers to the bone to get enough money for a bribe to get him out.
I'm not afraid of hard work.
I'm a good, honest, working girl.
But who would take care of me if I ever fell into prison?
Nobody cares about me.
I'm all alone in the world. All alone.
He pinched me.
I was walking along so obediently, and he pinched me in a most vulgar way.
- She lies! I didn't touch her.
- Fall back. You, walk with the other.
Now this one.
Is there no protection against the advances of these filthy conscripts?
I did not...
Look, little soldier, what a good street this is.
I could give you a little shove, and you could fall down, and I could get away, and nobody would catch me.
I'd be gone before those stupid Andalusians ever knew what happened.
Nobody would know.
You could tell them I escaped.
Then I'd be very grateful to you.
I'm very charming when I'm grateful.
Remember, 8:00 tonight at Lillas Pastia's?
How can we be there together if I'm in a dirty prison cell?
It would be so easy. I run very fast.
You should see me run.
I have very good legs.
See what good legs I have, little soldier, for running.
Wait a minute. Come back here. Help me up.
I think I've injured my ankle.
He made no attempt to pursue the prisoner and pretended injuries to prevent his men from following her.
I warn you that you have sacrificed months of good behaviour.
You had a bright future in the Dragoons, Don José.
I advise you to avoid this gypsy.
I grant you the girl is interesting.
But for a young man who takes his future seriously, a girl like that spells ruin.
For an older man who has nothing to lose and has time for a little foolish indulgence, it's another matter, perhaps.
Remember what I told you.
You'll take extra guard duty and be confined to your barracks for 30 days.
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.
- What is the password, sentry?
- Carmen! Carmen is the password!
Just mention her name and the way is cleared, like a miracle!
Take pity. Take pity.
Bless you.
- What are those gypsies doing here?
- They've come to entertain.
The Colonel sent his own carriage after them.
When he gives a party, he does things handsomely,
I'll say that for him.
That girl, the one who's dancing, how can she be so bold as to come to the Colonel's party?
- She's in hiding from the police.
- That's Carmen.
And the Colonel is a man, just like any other man, I suppose.
But it won't last.
She never likes anybody very long.
What are you doing here?
Have you been free to come and go and make eyes at every man you see while I've had to walk sentry duty like a common soldier, because of you?
Have you?
Tell me how that could be, or as heaven is my witness...
Tell me how that could be!
Well, now.
This is the first time
I've heard you really talk.
Anger is very becoming to you.
- You make me think of a fighting bull.
- Answer me!
It is very simple in this case.
The good, kind Colonel has pardoned me,
-because I am innocent.
-Innocent.
Well, isn't that why you let me run away, because I was innocent?
But what could I do?
I've waited for you every night.
If you preferred to walk alone in the rain, is that my fault?
But why was I walking?
Because I was punished for letting you escape, that's why.
All that for me, just imagine!
I owe you a great deal, it seems.
- How much longer must you stand here?
- What importance is that to you?
Another hour.
Just one more hour, and I can leave here.
I'm confined to the barracks, but I'll get away. I swear it.
Come to think of it,
I'm beginning to be bored with this party.
I think I shall run away from it and go to Lillas Pastia's.
In about an hour. That same hour you were speaking of, little cousin.
Notice how the fat is spitting tonight?
Something is going to happen.
You really believe in those things, don't you, old witch?
I know them.
What does spitting fat signify?
That emotions will grow overheated until they explode.
You wait. You'll see.
Well, then, it's nothing to worry me, since I have no emotions.
It is nothing to worry Pablo, because Pablo is worried about nothing but money.
It is nothing to worry Remendado, because Remendado is a fatalist, anyway.
So you see, old crone, the three of us are safe from danger.
Who would you say the fat is spitting at tonight?
Well, the buzzards have gathered already.
- Didn't you expect us?
- Yes, but not tonight.
- We couldn't wait any longer.
-It was a case of fish catches men.
We could smell it frying clear up in the mountains.
That reminds me.
If that old trout, the Colonel, comes here, tell him I've gone.
I've gone to Portugal or somewhere.
I told him not to come here tonight.
And to keep him away, I promised him faithfully I would go back to his house.
But I don't trust him. Men are such liars!
- What about Andrés?
- Who?
- Andres. You knew his name yesterday.
- Tell him I've gone to Gibraltar.
Carmen, was the Colonel's party successful, Carmen?
- No, it was very stupid.
- Was it successful?
We need another 200 duros to get Garcia out of jail.
Let him stay where he is.
Is that a way for a loving wife to feel about her husband?
- Let him rot!
- No money for Garcia?
We will tell him.
- There, thief, and be welcome to it.
- Is this all?
I left the party early.
There is much love in your cards, Carmen.
Much, much love.
And money. A fine new dress of silk.
- I can feel the silk. It's the best quality.
- Good.
Perhaps Garcia will be rescued from jail, after all. And prosper.
Perhaps. Perhaps they'll hang him.
Do you happen to see a nice hanging there?
No. No hanging.
Too bad.
- Now, that's odd.
- What is?
One love.
One love emerges from all the rest and makes the others nothing.
You're talking nonsense, old witch.
There is no such thing as one love to Carmen.
One at a time. One at a time.
Nothing can stop this.
It's destined. It's written here.
You're doing it yourself.
You're pulling it to you with dark, invisible threads that are strong, Carmen.
As strong as life itself.
As strong as death.
What is it?
What do you see there that makes you look like that?
- That isn't my fortune.
- The fat's in the fire, all right.
Just as I said.
That isn't my fortune, I tell you.
I didn't cut the cards.
Anyway, I don't believe in cards.
I never have.
As if you could see in those stupid cards that death was walking my way.
We all have to die, and I can't think of a nicer way than to be killed by love.
Where are you going, little soldier?
Because wherever it is, I'm going with you.
Get busy, you two. We want some yemas, nougats and a bottle of wine.
Bottle of wine.
Some bread and some cheese and some fruits, candy and sausages.
We are on our way to a feast.
Do you want us to starve to death?
Pay the old pirate, little soldier.
- There's so much here.
- She's always hungry, that girl.
Someday she'll eat the wrong thing, and then she'll howl about the pain as if she had never been warned at all.
Because they've lost their own appetites, they hate to see anybody else enjoy eating.
Come along.
This is where I live.
Watch out. There are five steps here.
One, two, three, four, five.
Does it please you?
This is where I live when I'm in Seville.
Where do you live when you're not in Seville?
- I've heard...
- Then you've heard lies.
Because what you have heard about me, you have heard from payos.
And payos always lie about gypsies.
Always.
Is it really true what I've heard about the men of Navarre?
What?
Is it really true that they wear little blue berets and tell big black lies?
- Never. Never.
- And don't know how to love a woman?
Well, that's true.
Teach me. lam from Navarre and I don't know a thing.
There's a big black lie.
The gypsies say that a lover should have gentle hands, a gentle mouth and a gentle heart.
- And a woman the same?
- No.
She should have cruel hands, a cruel mouth and no heart at all.
Oh, no. No. My beads.
Oh, no.
The cards. You don't know about the cards.
And this morning, I saw a black cat.
And now the beads.
Breaking beads are the worst, the very worst.
Those things don't mean anything.
That's just superstition.
Go away. Go home.
Say goodbye and think no more of Carmen.
- What is the matter with you?
- You're a nice boy, but I don't love you.
I don't love anybody.
I never in my life loved anybody.
And you are just the sort of big stupid who falls in love in return for a kiss and then makes a nuisance of himself.
You can go out this back way. Get out.
Have you lost your hearing?
I said, "Go home!"
But why?
Because I am afraid that...
- That someday you will be very cruel.
- Carmen...
Go away.
You can't make me go away.
Not now, Carmen.
- I can make you do as I please.
- No.
Yes, anytime. Anytime I like.
I won't have you here.
You're the one. I can sense it.
A gypsy knows things.
I never want to look on your ugly, murdering face again!
Do you hear me? Stay away from me.
Joséito! Wait!
Joséito.
I think I must be crazy.
I don't know how to say it.
I don't know how to tell you, but...
Love has been told a thousand ways, so let it be.
You'll come with me to the mountains, where we'll...
Get out.
I order you to leave.
Report to me in the morning.
I order you to leave.
Carmen is not here. Now get out.
You'll be court-martialled in the morning, of course.
In the meantime,
I think you need to be taught a little lesson.
A little lesson, for a little Corporal.
A little lesson for a white-livered conscript.
The others should be riding in any time.
I wish they wouldn't come.
I wish they'd never come.
We couldn't get along without them.
We haven't got a peseta between us.
A man as hunted as you are needs friends, good money-making friends.
I don't know what's happened to me.
Here I am, a deserter from the army, the murderer of my own Colonel.
I can't imagine how it happened.
One minute, I thought he was going to kill me, and the next minute, there...
My sword.
Don't think about it.
You're here and I'm here.
That's enough.
Think about it that way.
Just Carmen and José.
- All to myself.
- All to yourself.
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.
This is Don José, a strong, healthy addition to our company.
You'll find him very valuable.
This is Remendado.
He's stupid, but a good enough fellow.
This is Pablo. He's very good at fighting, but don't ever turn your back on him.
I can well imagine you're starving.
I have everything ready.
The soldier here has just escaped with his ears.
All of Seville is after him.
He killed his Colonel in a sword fight, ran him through as neatly as a pig on a spit.
So I decided he could join us.
I like him.
What will Garcia say?
We need new men.
Garcia is practical in his thinking.
- Who's Garcia?
- Garcia?
He's our leader. He's been in jail.
He killed a border policeman.
That's eight notches on his belt now.
Eight?
Eight or one, what's the difference in principle?
Dancaire's in Seville now arranging for Garcia's release with a nice, fat bribe.
It isn't a bad life. We travel.
There's a certain excitement about it.
And when we're lucky, there's money.
A little smuggling now and then, an occasional stagecoach full of rich passengers, a mule train carrying merchandise.
Sit down, José.
Here. Beside me, where you belong.
I'm still wondering what Garcia will say.
You might like to know that we cleared out the old merchant's storehouse
-without a cracked skull between us.
- Good.
It was chock full of tobacco and cotton goods, like you said it was.
The thieves' market in Cordova will be glad to see us.
We couldn't have done it without Carmen.
She charmed the watchman away from his post and trussed him up like a turkey ready for the oven.
You cheated and tied up an old man so that they could commit a robbery?
Tobacco's very valuable.
We sell it to smart cigar makers who wish to evade the government tax.
José, listen to me.
Whatever happens, say nothing.
Do you understand?
For my sake, Joséito, say nothing.
- Dancaire!
- Remendado!
It's good to see your ugly face.
We got the tobacco for you. And plenty of it.
- Fine.
- What a ride.
Pablo, see what's in the pot.
Get me something to eat.
- Right away.
- Dancaire, Remendado, see to the mules.
Carmen!
Show these ruffians how glad you are to have me back.
How I thought of you!
Every night, I said to my jailer,
"My Carmen is the most beautiful woman in Andalusia," and he said to me. "Go to sleep, you filthy goat, and dream about her."
And I did.
I did! I did. I did. I did. I did.
Come, sit beside me.
Who is that?
He's a hero.
He killed a colonel of the Dragoons.
Good. What's his name?
Don José.
Don José. A gentleman. Welcome, sefior.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, no!
Now that makes me sick.
Greetings!
Well, there was a lot of excitement about you in the city today, and I...
- Who is he? Who is that fellow?
- Garcia. He's our leader.
Take my advice and keep away from him.
He is a good leader, but another man's life doesn't mean much to him.
He's her husband, Navarrés.
- Her husband?
- That's right.
- Joséito, I want to tell you something.
- There's nothing you can tell me now.
Why didn't you tell me before?
Why didn't you tell me about Garcia?
- I didn't know he'd be back so soon.
- You knew. You knew.
All right, but I didn't think he'd be back until tomorrow.
Is it my fault he rides that fast?
What kind of a creature are you?
Your kind, Joséito.
Can you forget so soon? Can you?
Go back to him.
Go on, go back where you belong.
Look at me, Joséito.
Look at me.
So much the better. I'll live longer.
How do you like this life? Pleasant, isn't it?
You eat better than you do in the army, and the pay is much better.
You can see that already.
Garcia got 2,000 duros to divide among us just for politely delivering some tobacco to a crooked cigar maker.
- What could be simpler than that?
- He can keep my share.
- Your share of what?
- The money.
I did not quite know what you meant.
Jose, did you see the posters in Cordova offering a reward for your capture?
You're very fortunate that your companions have such nobility of character.
But don't trust Pablo. He has no manners about things like that at all.
Get off. I'll see what's ahead.
Take cover, they've seen us!
- Do you know how to use a gun, cabal/era?
- I was a soldier.
I know, but can you shoot?
- I can do anything you can do.
- Does Carmen say so?
If she does, she lies, the black witch.
- Joséito.
- Keep down, you little fool.
I'm not afraid. When I'm killed, it won't be by a stranger, José.
That much I know.
Joseito, listen! We could get out of here without anyone even knowing it.
Then if Garcia stayed and got himself killed, we couldn't help that, could we?
The soldiers have good pistols and they shoot straight, Joséito.
I hate him, but he's my comrade.
You're a true payo, all right, always afraid of being dishonourable.
You are like the dwarf who thought himself tall because he could spit a long distance.
You don't love me.
The sergeant's been killed!
The sergeant's been killed!
Come on. Let's get out of here, fast now.
Those soldiers have only gone for reinforcements.
I don't believe I'll try to go with you right now, Jose.
Something seems to be wrong.
I'll get your mule and put you on it.
Let's go, Jose, and bring the chickens.
No use leaving them for the soldiers.
Wait a minute.
You don't understand.
He isn't dead. He's only hurt.
He's still alive? I didn't know that.
We'd be foolish to leave him here.
He might be recognised as one of our men.
Garcia!
It would take a clever person to recognise him now. Carmen.
That girl is crazy, bathing in these icy waters.
Listen to her.
I didn't say, "Look at her," payo.
I said, "Listen to her."
I can't see her from here.
But you can see her in your imagination.
That's what you're doing, seeing her in your mind.
I can tell it from your face.
I'm afraid you'll have to be content with just sharing my money with me, caballero.
I don't want to share anything with you.
You keep your filthy money.
He doesn't want my money.
Just what did you have in mind, cabal/era, that you do want in payment for the work you do here?
Is there anything else that belongs to me that you were thinking about?
Anything that belongs to you would be just as filthy and evil as you, and I wouldn't want it.
I'll tell her, payo. I'll tell her.
But watch yourself, she will probably slit out your white liver and serve it to me for breakfast.
Are you such a coward you have to have a woman do your carving for you?
- Coward?
- Yes, coward.
Has it slipped your mind that we lost a man today, Garcia?
So we did.
So we did.
Now, then, it looks as though
I'll have to let this puppy live until I can find a man to replace him.
I am unarmed, payo, as you can see.
An honourable gentleman like yourself doesn't attack an unarmed man, does he?
Does he, Don José?
It would be too bad to kill him and waste the nice, fat reward offered for his capture.
Courage, little mule. Only two more turns in the road, and we'll be in Cordova.
I'll have to find a lovesick fool who'll follow me into a nice little trap.
Then we'll have some money to spend, and you'll have a fresh carrot.
Not here yet. Another hour until sunset.
We'll have time for a game of cards before they come.
Too bad the Navarrés won't be here to see the fun.
I wonder why he refused to obey your orders and come with us.
He said he was sick, and I believe him.
- He is sick.
- He's sick, all right.
Sick because Carmen is doing a little work, for a change.
Don't payo women contribute anything?
Payo women do not, ordinarily, pick up men and lure them into ambush to be robbed by their husbands, Garcia.
He is what he is. He's not a gypsy.
- He can't think the way a gypsy does.
- You're not a gypsy. You think the way I do.
I don't think at all. That's my protection.
And I feel nothing.
I simply observe, and I'm amused.
El Navarrés is not an observer.
He feels strongly, and it's killing him.
Don't worry.
I won't let him die slowly of love, Dancaire.
Are they here yet?
With the bullfights in Cordova this week,
Carmen should have very good luck.
When the bullfights are in town, the place is always crowded with nice, fat pockets to pick.
- You're in good form today, Lucas.
- I'm in good form every day, Carlocito.
No ordinary bull can stand on his feet against cunning like yours, Lucas.
Nor any ordinary woman.
But then I'm not an ordinary woman.
You know, you look to me like a man who would enjoy having his fortune told.
And you look to me like a girl who would be very skilful at it.
I have a little place on the edge of town that's a very nice little place for fortune-telling.
And I know a little place in the middle of town that's a better place for fortune-telling.
- And I say we'll go to my little place.
- And I say we'll go to mine.
- She should've been here a long time ago.
- Maybe she never went into town at all.
Maybe that's why the Navarrés lied and said he was sick.
Maybe they had it planned that way all the time.
That's not true, Garcia.
You two remain here for another hour.
If she still comes, we'll have lost nothing.
If she's playing games with me, it only takes one of us to deal with her.
Why do you hate e! Navarrés so?
Can it be because Carmen...
Shut up!
Well, you, too, Pablo?
Poor little Carmen, such magic as she possesses can only destroy her.
Joséito.
- You didn't go with the others?
- No.
You didn't take anyone to them for them to rob?
- No.
- Why not?
Maybe because...
Maybe because I had a feeling you didn't want me to do those things any more.
I can see you don't believe me. Too bad.
- Don't you want something to eat?
- No.
- Aren't you hungry?
- No.
I am. I'm always hungry.
You never are.
How can I be, when I'm sick every minute of the day?
I know what's the matter with me.
Why don't I go away from here?
It's driving me crazy being around you, knowing that you're married to another man.
Why don't I go away where I can't see it?
I wouldn't be married to another man if you'd used your head yesterday, would I?
So, my little companion, you would play games with Garcia?
I believe we had a rendezvous at the edge of town at sunset. Was I mistaken?
Could I possibly have missed you, or is it possible you didn't feel like working today?
No, you didn't miss me, Garcia.
I had better things to do today.
Didn't we, little soldier?
You filthy wench. You can choose your pastimes where you like, but while I'm master here, you'll work, too.
Nobody is my master, you dirty old goat!
I'm Carmen, and I work when I want to work!
So, puppy, you would play games with Garcia, too?
Don José.
I'll kill you.
Two murders on your soul now, for nothing.
Why didn't you just ask him for Carmen?
He'd have sold her to you.
- Sold her?
- Yes. Gypsies sell their women.
He bought her, married her when she was
12 years old, a typical gypsy marriage.
- I'm going to marry her.
- How? Where?
You can't show your face in a town in Spain.
Then we'll have a gypsy wedding, a gypsy wedding in the hills.
You'll be a fine pair, you two.
Payo and gypsy, the tamed and the untamed, the dog and wolf.
Dog and wolf weren't created to live together.
It won't work, Navarrés. You'll see.
One camp is the same as the other.
Why are we moving?
We move when the birds move.
They have an instinct about those things.
We go now to our winter home, Joséito.
We should send out invitations, I think.
The sefior and sefiora...
What did you say our name is?
Lizarabengoa.
...will be at home for the winter in the caves of Granada.
Won't it be cold living there in the caves?
No, Joséito. It won't be cold.
Everybody out, line up and no talking.
Your valuables.
We have company.
What are you doing here? I told you
I wanted you to stay away from this.
I was bored.
I won't sit on my haunches and wait for you like a wife of a payo, stirring a pot of stew.
I've been my own woman and a gypsy too long, my friend.
I told you to leave these matters to me.
I want no more of this.
You told me. You wanted no more.
I'm not your slave. I'm Carmen, and nobody tells me what to do!
I do as I please. If you are ashamed of what I am, find another woman.
Get yourself a payo wife.
You and your payo honour.
I spit on your honour.
Get back to camp.
- I always used to ride with Garcia.
- I'm not Garcia.
No, you're not. In many ways, you're not.
Get back in the coach. All of you!
Your leader is a brave man everywhere but at home, it seems.
Carmen. Carmen, let's go away.
I want to clear out of this.
- Come away with me, Carmen.
- Where to?
Where do you think you can go with every Dragoon, every soldier under orders to shoot you at sight like a mad dog?
I don't know where we could go, but I know that I'm sick to death of this.
I've had enough of it.
We could go away, you and I, perhaps to the New World, to Mexico.
I want to live like other people, without hiding.
I'm hungry for the sight of simple, gentle people.
I want to sit around with plain men and talk about farming, about...
I find myself so many times, lately, thinking about my home in the north.
They'll hang you there, too, if you show your face.
But we could go to Mexico, couldn't we?
It wouldn't be like home, but we could live like other people.
I wasn't born to grow cabbages, Joséito.
You knew that right from the beginning, when you chose to lead this kind of life with me.
I didn't choose it.
So it's my fault!
I led you into it, by the nose, I suppose!
You killed the Colonel. I didn't.
Dog and wolf.
It's beginning, just like I said. Dog and wolf.
I knew you would be a nuisance. I said it!
You and your tiresome regrets and your weeping about something that's already over and done with!
Take your payo conscience and make some other woman a present of it.
I tell you I'm sick of it!
It'd be well if you borrowed some of my conscience, because you have none of your own.
You wouldn't love me nearly so much if I had a conscience, Joséito.
That's a wonderful excuse, to say, I'm a gypsy, and I don't know right from wrong.
I don't know, Joséito, tell me.
What is right, what is wrong?
Is that wrong, little soldier?
Out of the way, gypsy.
Out of the way, I tell you. We're in a hurry.
Well, now, so the payos are in a hurry, are they? That's too bad, isn't it now?
Because I'm in no hurry at all.
- Carmen.
- Lucas.
Carmen, where have you been?
Cordova hasn't seen you in months.
Well, I've been a little busy, Lucas.
A few killings, a wedding here and there.
And what about you?
Also a few killings, but no weddings.
And many happy hours of thinking of you, my Carmen.
I was on my way into Cordova to pick up a few provisions.
But you know I am the best provider in all Cordova, Carmen, to a very small and exclusive clientele.
I provide music and dancing and laughter and little memories.
Other times, when she went into Cordova for supplies, she came back the same day.
Probably the rain that's keeping her away.
You won't be seeing her for quite a while.
You might as well make up your mind to that. Carmen likes to laugh, and there hasn't been much of that around here lately, it seems to me.
She's found herself a good time somewhere.
I know her better than you do, Navarrés.
I tell you, I do know her better.
You shouldn't have kicked him.
His nose is broken.
You don't like us, do you?
We fill you with disgust.
We're the symbol of your degradation.
Where've you been?
Answer me. Where've you been?
I'll beat you black and blue if you don't answer me.
I was in Cordova, worrying about you.
Another regiment of lancers arrived in town today, and I saw a poster offering a reward of 5,000 duros for your capture.
If you're clever, you'll get out of here.
There're some people who might think
5,000 duros worthwhile.
I know a place outside of Gibraltar where you could stay.
There're some cotton goods coming in from England.
You could pick up some and sell them to Rodrigo. He's still in Gibraltar.
Help me.
Where've you been?
I went to the bullfight yesterday, and I saw a very clever bullfighter called Lucas.
They say he has an embroidered vest that cost 3,000 duros.
Imagine, a vest that cost 3,000 duros.
- Where did you get that dress?
- That's my affair.
Where did you get that dress?
I'll kill you. As heaven is my witness,
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!
- Joséito, little soldier...
- Who is he? Who is he?
- Who gave it to you?
- Look, Joséito. Look!
- Look how Carmen loves you. Look!
- I know you. I know what you are!
Who is it now? Who is it now?
Who is it now?
The cards never lie to a gypsy, my friend.
They always tell the truth, Lucas.
And what are they telling you at this minute that makes you look like such a beautiful thundercloud?
They tell me that the thing I've been expecting is coming nearer, Lucas.
They tell me that it might be soon now.
You're really afraid of something you see there, aren't you, Carmen?
You're not the only one who has death as a business partner, little bullfighter.
Death travels with me, too.
In the form of a man who loves me.
The cards always say that, Lucas, that such a man will kill me.
And I know such a man.
Yes, you've changed.
We become what we do.
Don José.
For all these months, I've been telling myself, "I am not José, e! Navarrés.
"I'm not truly a deserter.
I'm not a robber. I'm not a thief.
"I am Don José Lizarabengoa, a well-bred young man with a bright future,
"who is, for the moment, playing at being a highwayman, because he loves Carmen."
But that's not true.
I am no longer Don José, because we become what we do.
I am José, e! Navarrés, and I am just as cruel and ugly and hard as Garcia was.
No. You're worse, because you have a conscience.
The only really wicked men I've ever known were those who started as idealists.
That's what depravity feeds on.
Illusions and idealism and love gone wrong.
I have news for you, Navarrés.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
She is having a good time, like I thought.
And I know where she is.
- And who it is she's taken up with.
- Who?
You heard her mention Lucas, the bullfighter?
He has a fine house in the street of the Bajari.
And they're together every afternoon in the Corral de la Plaza.
I would certainly go there and bring her back if she belonged to me.
No wife of mine would go around flaunting herself in front of...
No, José. No, look, I'm only telling you for your own good. José, please...
Poor Pablo.
No matter what he does, he always ends the same way, on the ground.
Don't be an idiot. You can't go into the city.
They'll shoot you down without even thinking about it.
Be patient, amigo.
She'll be back one of these days.
- You must get used to this sort of thing.
- Never.
There, little bullfighter. And there'll be another one for every bull you kill.
Be careful, you'll have me killing every bull in Spain.
Bring me the ears, Lucas.
Don't forget the reward, now.
5,000 duros, and I get half of it.
He'll come along, you'll see.
He'll be coming here to get her.
Just keep your eye on her, and you'll get him.
What kind of a fool are you to show your face in Cordova?
- Carmen.
- Did you see that black cat?
A black cat is all kinds of bad luck.
It means serious trouble every time, Jose.
- If you had any brains at all, you'd...
- Carmen, let's go home.
- No.
- Please, Carmen.
I can't stand it any longer, this waiting. Please.
Maybe tomorrow, Jose.
Maybe I'll be back tomorrow.
It's because I hit you, isn't it?
You wouldn't have left me if I hadn't.
I know you wouldn't.
I don't know what made me do it.
I'll never do it again. I promise.
I'll be a good husband.
But please, Carmencita.
Please come home with me.
- No.
- You'll do what I tell you to do.
I'll do what it pleases me to do.
I always have, and I always will.
And right now it pleases me to watch the bullfight.
It's Lucas the matador now, is that it?
- What difference does it make?
- Answer me!
Yes! Yes! Now, are you satisfied?
And why not?
I like to laugh once in a while, and what have I had with you?
Nothing but tears and preaching and long faces.
I can't live penned up in a cage. I won't!
I'm sick of it, can't you understand?
I'm sick of you.
Now get away and leave me alone!
Carmen, don't leave me, don't leave me.
I love you so much.
See how much I love you.
You are all I have left in the world, little Carmen. I gave up everything.
I've lost everything.
I gave it all up for you, but I don't mind.
I'm not sorry.
Only, please, please don't leave me.
Like a worm, cut him in half and still he crawls.
Listen. They've let the bull in.
You're keeping me from seeing the bullfight.
You're not gonna get away with it, Carmen.
Not this time you're not.
I'll kill him, do you hear me? I'll kill him!
And what would that settle? You've killed two men who loved me. And for what?
Then I'll kill you, you black-hearted witch!
I'll kill you.
I used to think you would, but I don't any more. You're not man enough.
Now get out of my way!
For the last time, are you coming back with me?
Do not hang on to me. I can't stand to have anyone hang on to me!
- Answer me!
- No, no, no, no, no!

I'm Noboru Yasumoto.
Yasumoto?
I know. I'll take him.
I'm Genzo Tsugawa.
I've been waiting for you.
With you here, I can leave.
You're taking my place.
I was just told to call.
You were in Nagasaki?
For how long?
Just over three years.
It's terrible here.
You'll have to stay and see for yourself.
The patients are slum people, full of fleas and lice.
They even smell bad.
We don't get much money.
And Red Beard is after us night and day.
Red Beard?
The head doctor.
His beard is sort of reddish.
It's really terrible here.
Being here makes you wonder why you wanted to be a doctor.
It smells like rotten fruit.
It's the smell of the poor.
The waiting room for outpatients.
They're treated for free in the afternoons.
I don't know.
All of them would be better off dead.
This way.
The pharmacy.
The clinic.
The men's wards.
Over there, the women's wards.
Is there no tatami?
No. Our rooms are all the same.
Same as a prison.
Yes, even our clothes are like this.
It's all right for us men.
But even poor women are women.
They should wear something brighter.
I'd hate to die in this.
These clothes...
They show dirt.
They're easy to wash.
So, you see, we can always stay clean.
You smelled when you came here, but it's not so bad now.
You owe it all to your clothes.
See?
You shouldn't talk.
Red Beard said so, didn't he?
If you don't mind him, you'll spit up blood again.
We're better off dead.
Too poor to even buy medicine!
But when I die,
I'd like to die on tatami!
Even the poorest have tatami.
It's bad for us.
You see, tatami catches all the dirt and moisture.
That's why...
Sahachi, if you don't keep quiet, you'll really die.
Are these things the rule here?
Red Beard's rules.
He's the dictator here.
A good doctor, dedicated to his work.
Many daimyo and rich people trust him.
But he's stubborn, inconsiderate, radical, and proud.
Beyond here are our quarters.
The south side gets the sun.
That's for the patients.
The damp north side is for us.
The patients' service room.
The kitchen.
We eat here.
It's called the dining room.
We must not eat or drink in our rooms.
They're all Red Beard's rules.
We are to have no heat except in the wards.
Red Beard says the cold here is good for us.
And there's not enough money to buy coal except for the wards.
Red Beard's room.
I brought Dr. Yasumoto!
Come in.
I'm Noboru Yasumoto.
Red Beard.
My real name's hard to pronounce...
Kyojo Niide.
You'll start as an intern today.
But l...
Wait. Father only said to call on you.
You'll stay here.
Bring me all the notes and drawings you made at Nagasaki.
They are at home.
I'll go back and...
No, your things will be here soon.
That's all.
Show him his room.
I'm Handayu Mori.
It's pretty difficult here.
But if you want, you can learn a lot.
Useful in the future.
Let's work together.
I won't be cooped up here!
I studied to serve the shogunate!
I was to be the shogun's doctor!
And it's...
Please listen!
My father's a doctor.
Dr. Amano's his friend.
He's the shogun's personal doctor?
Yes, he helped me to go study in Nagasaki.
He said he'd recommend me.
Then why did this happen?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
It's...
A mix-up somewhere.
Even with Dr. Amano's backing, this still happened, so you'd better make the best of it.
We knew you were coming two weeks ago.
It seems he likes you.
He's unfriendly to people he likes.
Not me.
He never finds fault with me.
He ignores me completely.
I won't do as he says.
It's some sort of trick.
I'm leaving, no matter what Red Beard says.
We are under the jurisdiction of the magistrate's office here.
And it has appointed you officially.
You can't hide or run away.
Thanks to you, I can go.
I'll take you to your room.
I mean, we share it until I leave.
Excuse me.
He's quite a genius, but we don't get along well.
This is our room.
Your things are here already.
Where are you going?
Running away will make trouble!
Running away will make trouble!
She's worse again and I'm out of medicine!
Please make me some.
Only Red Beard does that.
He's in his room.
Dr. Yasumoto!
KOSHI KAWA CLI NIC HERB GARDEN
No one's allowed in here.
Only Red Beard.
Osugi's different.
She's a nurse.
Is that a ward too?
The girl's father built it himself.
She's a special patient.
The whole house is a prison.
Osugi has the key and no one gets in.
The girl isn't let out either.
She's called "the mantis."
It's a good nickname.
The female eats the male after they mate.
She'd do the same thing.
No one knows who she is, but it seems she's the daughter of a merchant.
She killed three clerks there.
She'd seduce them first.
When they'd get excited over her, she'd stab them with a hairpin.
Had they ever done anything to her?
Red Beard says she was just born that way.
An hysterical condition rather than insanity.
It's really a pity.
She's very beautiful.
Why don't you eat, Yasumoto?
I don't want to!
Does it mean you're not hungry or that the food doesn't suit you?
It means this place doesn't suit me.
Even bad food tastes good if you chew it well.
Same with our work here, if you try hard.
I hear your things are here.
Why don't you bring me your notes?
I refuse.
Refuse? Why?
I studied Dutch medicine, developing my own diagnoses and cures.
They are mine and not for others!
Medical knowledge belongs to everyone.
Doctors get rich just by curing cataracts.
We don't gossip here.
Bring me your notes and change into your uniform.
Go and get me some sake!
We don't drink sake here.
That's why I'll drink!
I'll break every rule!
No uniform.
I'll be such a nuisance, he'll ask me to leave.
Get me some sake!
You're a nuisance.
Don't you understand?
It's you who won't understand.
No one's allowed here, so I came.
Hoping to get Dr. Niide mad so he'll dismiss you?
But...
You can't fool him by acting like a child.
And is that the only reason you came here?
What's that?
Interested in my mistress?
I won't deny it.
As a doctor, I'd like to treat an unusual patient.
Unlike Mori,
I specialized in medicine.
I know more about curing than Red Beard.
Why not help the other patients then?
Any doctor can help them.
You're just talking.
I don't believe it.
Don't believe what?
Not Dr. Niide, but the others are interested in her.
Dr. Tsugawa...
Tsugawa? What'd he do?
He came to see her while I was out, and almost...
Luckily, there were bars between them.
I'm not like him.
I wonder.
It's hard to believe men.
I don't believe women.
I've suffered enough for believing one.
Where were you?
A visitor.
Masae, she said.
Chigusa's sister, she said to tell you.
Chigusa? I won't see her.
Tell her I'm out.
Sahachi, go to bed!
Yes, right away.
We've told him too.
He works, then buys eggs and fish for the patients.
Gives away his own medicine... gruel too.
And he's very sick himself.
He's a bother.
I'm sorry.
I'll be through very soon.
They're all too much!
What are you doing?
Going to keep it up?
No one's going to waste any sympathy on your sulking.
Least of all Dr. Niide.
He won't change.
Think carefully. You yourself stand to lose the most.
Tsugawa's gone. Dr. Niide's very busy and short of help.
It's very late, yet he's still out seeing patients.
But you...
He's been saying for a long time he wants good doctors.
Especially here at the clinic.
Good, dedicated doctors.
Tsugawa was no good.
That's why he expected a lot of you.
That's not what he expected of me.
I know.
What is it then?
He called me here to get my notes and drawings.
You see? He's ignored me after getting them.
I do nothing.
He doesn't say anything.
Doctor!
What is it?
It's my mistress! My mistress!
What about her?
She's run away!
I left the key in the lock.
I was in the kitchen.
Please help me.
I'm not insane at all.
Please listen to me.
You're the new doctor, aren't you?
Osugi told me.
Doctors in uniforms are no good.
They won't listen to me.
But you will, won't you?
I admit to killing the clerks.
But there was a reason for it. l...
When I was a child, a man did something very bad to me.
But... a woman can't talk about it.
I'm a doctor. Don't be shy.
When I was nine years old, an old clerk did something naughty.
If I told anybody about it, he said he'd kill me.
He was dismissed soon after that for spending store money.
But he made me do things many times before that.
Each time he threatened to kill me if I told anyone.
Then...
No, I can't go on!
Tell me.
Tell me everything.
When I was 11, it happened again.
In a warehouse.
With a shop assistant.
He also said he'd kill me if I told anyone.
He told me to come the next day.
I did as he said.
I thought he'd kill me if I didn't.
I'll be killed.
I'll be killed!
Calm yourself.
I'm afraid!
Be calm!
I'll be killed!
I'm afraid!
Be quiet!
Please help me.
Please!
Calm yourself and tell me everything.
When I was 17, a clerk came into my bedroom.
I knew I'd be killed.
He'd kill me this time for sure.
I forgot myself.
With this...
The clerk lay down beside me.
He held me this way.
He talked like this to me.
Then I did this.
I'd kill him instead.
I stabbed him with this.
Right here.
Don't get up.
Lie quietly.
She missed the artery, just grazed your neck.
You'll be well in a day.
But if I'd come in any later, you'd be dead.
Look, she lit into me too.
She bit me five times here.
She was born that way.
You heard about her childhood too?
But many other girls have had experiences like that.
It's nothing. Lie still.
You were drunk.
And men have a weakness for pretty girls.
That's all.
Don't be ashamed, but let it be a lesson to you.
Please go to North Ward No. 1.
An order?
Dr. Niide wants you.
You won't?
Why not wear your uniform?
You'll get dirty.
You examine him.
He's unconscious.
He's dying.
His case history.
Give me a diagnosis.
- Stomach cancer.
- No.
There's a case like his in your notes.
It's a kind of cancer.
It's in the liver.
The cancer doesn't spread fast.
Pain only comes when it's grown large enough.
So it's too late then.
It's rather rare.
Remember it.
There's no cure for it?
No, and this disease isn't the only one.
There are no cures, really.
Medical science doesn't know everything.
We know the symptoms and how things go.
If the patient has a chance, we try to help.
But that's about all.
We can only fight poverty and ignorance.
And cover up what we don't know.
Poverty's a political problem, they say.
But what has politics ever done for the poor?
Has a law been passed to get rid of poverty and ignorance?
But this place!
Government funds...
Better this than nothing.
The problem is deeper than that.
If it weren't for poverty, half of these people wouldn't be sick.
I know.
There is always some story of great misfortune behind illness.
This Rokusuke was a gold-lacquer craftsman of some note, it seems.
Yet he was brought in from a cheap inn, has no visitors, won't talk.
He won't answer questions.
Hasn't said a single word.
He hasn't even said it hurts.
His heart probably hurts him even more.
A girl's been hurt, Doctor!
At a building site.
She's too much for me.
Nothing's so solemn as a man's last moments.
Watch him closely.
Room No. 3.
I'll look after him.
You're needed while they sew her up.
Hold her legs down.
She's been drugged but may struggle.
Don't get knocked over.
Needle!
Don't look away!
Watch while I suture.
Don't let her move.
Spread her legs out more!
Her intestines are coming out!
Shove them in!
I fainted at my first operation too.
You'll get used to it.
You won't mind it then.
No, I can't even watch a man dying.
Calling it solemn.
To me, it's horrible.
How's Rokusuke?
He died.
Without saying a word.
Did you think his death solemn?
The pain and loneliness of death frighten me.
But Dr. Niide looks at it differently.
He looks into their hearts as well as their bodies.
For example, he saw some great misfortune behind his silence.
That's probably why he said solemn.
I want to be like him someday.
There's just too much to do today.
First an operation, and then Sahachi.
He worked again after all my warnings and got worse.
He's in North Room No. 3, but he may not recover this time.
I'll go.
Sahachi, don't die.
Sahachi, don't die.
Don't give up, Sahachi.
You're saying that so that he'll work more for you again?
No, I'm not.
Sahachi's like a saint, that's why.
Yes, when the world's full of no-good people,
I can't stand having him leave us.
I see.
But you should be in bed too.
Off with you.
I'll look after him.
You go too.
Being quiet is best for him.
Dr. Mori, I'm sorry
I didn't do as you said.
Dr. Mori's busy with the outpatients.
Oh, you're the new doctor, aren't you?
Why don't you wear your uniform, Doctor?
It helps people.
Why?
Seeing it, we know it's a clinic doctor.
Poor people who can't see a physician can get help from him.
Doctor, it seems to be the end for me.
If it is, there's one favor I'd like to ask.
- Where is Red Beard?
- In his room.
Rokusuke's daughter's here.
Would you believe it?
When he's just died?
She's here with her three children.
She was hoping she could rely on him.
Eat it. Go ahead.
You needn't worry.
Hard to eat with me here?
I'll go.
Sahachi said to ask you.
He wants to go home before he dies.
It was a very cold day.
I still remember how my chilblains hurt.
I was playing by the doorway when a man came to where I was.
He said he was my father.
He wanted me to go home with him.
He was pale, but he tried to smile and put a hand on my shoulder.
He said,
"Okuni, let's go home.
You're my precious only daughter.
You're my precious only daughter."
But I was only a child then.
I was frightened and I pushed him away and ran.
I was living with Mother and a young man she called a relative.
I didn't know anything.
He was father's assistant.
They'd been bad together then ran away.
I found that out after he'd married me.
Your mother's lover?
She was over 40.
It was probably the only way she could hold him.
But I saw them with my own eyes!
Never mind the rest.
What happened to your mother?
She died.
She left when she was found out.
She became a maid at a teahouse.
It seems they still saw each other.
She gave him money, so he didn't work.
Just before she died, she sent for my husband but didn't want to see me.
She made me marry him.
And she hated me.
I don't even know where her grave is.
I didn't build a family altar either.
I'm just as bad!
I knew what he was, yet I had three children by him!
Did you see your father after that?
After she died, he came to see me in secret again.
He seemed older.
I hardly recognized him.
His hair was all white.
He trembled when he spoke:
"Come with me and bring the three children."
But I was purposely rude and sent him away.
I told him to leave us alone.
How could I go with him?
And bring the children of the man who had taken both his wife and his daughter?
Was he in pain when he died?
No, he died peacefully.
He had to.
He had to!
If he hadn't, life would have been too cruel!
But that man!
When she died and the money stopped coming, he started in on the neighbors!
He'd get drunk and become abusive!
Said to get money from Father because
I was his only child.
"What kind of a man is this not to feed his own grandchildren?"
I put up with everything for the children's sake.
But there's a limit to my patience.
Telling me to get money from the man he'd hurt.
It's one thing he shouldn't have said.
That's why l...
I understand.
So you tried to stab him?
I meant to take the children to Father and then give myself up.
I went to the inn where Father said to come if I needed him.
I was told he was sick and came here long ago.
I came here, but...
What will I do?
Don't worry. Cutting someone up a little is not too serious.
No, an accident!
He was drunk... he had this knife.
You stabbed him while trying to get it.
That's what happened!
It often happens.
Luckily, I know Magistrate Shimada.
I know some things about him.
I'll go with you.
Go and confess.
My children... what will become of them?
The children.
That's right.
We'll ask Goheiji.
He's in charge of houses near here.
Has a fine wife too.
Take the children and Sahachi there.
After the magistrate's office,
I'll come too.
Sahachi!
Onaka... Onaka, why have you come?
You needn't have come.
I'll be with you soon.
I won't make you wait long.
The children have run away!
What?
We were asked to keep them!
Be more careful!
I'm all wet because of you!
There's a vacant house near here?
Will you rent it to them?
I'll be responsible.
How's Sahachi?
He has a high fever... delirious.
He keeps talking to a girl.
He never knew any women.
Move over.
No, you go home.
What's that?
Me and Sahachi are the longest tenants here.
And Sahachi's dying. You got no right keeping me from seeing him.
But you're drunk.
You don't know what you're doing when you're drunk.
I began to drink when I was nine, and I've been drinking ever since.
I can't say when I'm sober, but I know what I'm doing when I'm drunk.
Where's that Red Beard?
He'll be here.
You're a doctor at the clinic too?
My name's Heikichi.
I've known Red Beard a long time.
He told me once
I drank too much and threw up.
He looked fierce, awful fierce.
Said to support my family if I had the money to drink till I was drunk.
It's no laughing matter.
Thinking about the wife and kids would make me drink all the more.
Rich men and educated ones don't know this fact.
So there you have it.
- Stop it!
- What?
What's that, talking so big?
That's enough!
Bad for him!
What's that?
What of it?
Fool landlord!
Stuck-up Red Beard!
Sahachi, still hanging around!
He's worried about Sahachi.
That's why he's carrying on.
You all go home.
Standing there shuts out the air.
Please look after him, Doctor.
Help him to live if you can.
He never thought of himself, just about others.
He worked till he got sick, then worked while he was sick.
Go now. He's just gone to sleep.
Let him be quiet.
Why don't you examine him, Doctor?
Is it hopeless?
Two fine men dying one after the other.
Old Rokusuke died today.
He's the father of the woman
I just brought.
He left this ten ryo.
Use it for what they need.
I'll do that.
But, Doctor, a man dying at a public clinic wouldn't have so much money.
You scraped it together as usual?
We're friends.
You needn't have done it.
I scraped it together, all right, but I made Magistrate Shimada pay up.
Not only the money.
I used what I knew to get him to release the woman too.
Shimada was adopted into his wife's family.
But he's keeping a woman at his villa. Many men do.
She's grown melancholic about this... has grown extremely jealous.
I hinted to Shimada about the woman he's keeping.
I'm abominable.
True, the girl deserved to go free.
And the money's for my treating his wife.
But I did hint, so I did a cowardly thing.
Yasumoto.
From now on, if I'm arrogant at any time, remind me of today.
I'm going back.
You tend to Sahachi.
Pouring a while ago, but it's stopped.
What is it? I'll go see.
I'm sorry, but can I have some water?
A landslide!
It was a narrow escape.
Almost crushed Sahachi's place.
A skeleton!
That...
I buried it.
She was my wife.
She's come for me.
Will you call everyone, please?
I want to tell everything and die without any secrets.
Wait!
Please take this umbrella.
Thanks, but I'm wet already.
But it's bad for you.
I want to tell you about her.
Her name was Onaka.
After returning the umbrella,
I couldn't forget her.
We met many times in the field at Iriya.
I'm so happy.
You'll marry me then?
I'm happy, but I can't.
Why?
Why? Because I'm not free to do as I like.
I have seven brothers and sisters, and Father's sick.
I've been bonded for ten years.
How many more years?
One year, but I can't leave.
I must send money home.
Return the money.
But I have obligations.
I'll send money to your family.
- It's not that.
- What other obligations?
Another man?
Do I look like that?
I'm sorry.
I just thought...
Let's not talk about it.
It's no good.
But I wanted to marry her so much that I succeeded in persuading her.
She finally consented.
But, for some reason, she wouldn't introduce me to her parents.
No! I don't want to!
Why? Your parents will be mine.
It's funny not to meet them.
But not now!
I couldn't make her do it, but we got married.
It seemed like a dream.
We were so happy.
Then the great earthquake came.
Following it, fires broke out everywhere.
When I returned from the shop,
all the places near our home were in ruins.
When I couldn't find her body,
I felt a great relief.
But she'd vanished from that day.
I went to see her family.
They didn't know anything.
Said they thought she'd died long ago.
I moved here in the autumn of that year, when I'd convinced myself that she'd died.
After that, I continued living here, as you all know.
Two peaceful years went by.
Onaka was alive!
And with a baby on her back.
The baby's yours?
Yes.
His name's Takichi.
About a year old?
Eight months.
I felt a stab of pain, like a knife entering my heart.
My own wife nursing another man's child before my eyes.
I cannot explain it but it seemed so sad,
so unbelievably sad.
Are you happy?
We won't meet again, will we?
For several days after that,
I drank, then slept.
She'd looked back and bowed when we parted.
When her image rose before my eyes,
I was so sad, I could hardly breathe.
Who told you I lived here?
Your employer.
He told me many things.
You were sick a long time?
I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!
You won't forgive me?
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel myself.
I don't know if I'm sad or happy that you're alive.
Will you let me explain?
If it's not too painful for you.
Don't light it!
I was promised to a man already.
We lived on the same street.
Ever since he was younger, he said he was going to be one of our family.
So he helped support us.
When he was 20, he asked for my hand, and my parents consented.
I didn't like or dislike him.
But thinking of all he had done for us, I did not mind.
And then I met you.
I did not know what to do.
I was sorry for him.
But I could not leave you. lfinally made up my mind.
I owed a debt of kindness, but I thought it could be returned.
I became strong, almost frighteningly so.
My parents punished me, pleaded with me, but I did not give in.
Then why did you...
We were too happy together.
We were so happy,
I became afraid.
A girl like me did not deserve it.
I felt I'd be punished if it lasted.
So I was always uneasy.
Then the earthquake came.
I was right.
This is my punishment.
I've had my whole life's share of happiness.
The earthquake is a portent, saying to put an end to it.
My husband will think I have died.
That will end it all.
The time to end it has come.
I walked, brooding over it, and found myself before his house.
I understand.
I know how you must have felt.
I seemed lost after that, and before I knew it, I was his.
I suddenly felt awake when we met in Asakusa, as if I'd been carried off but was suddenly before my own house again.
He, my child, and I seem like different people who've gone far away.
I am here and this is the real me.
Hold me.
Please. Hold me closer.
Don't let me go.
Please hold me.
She said not to let her go.
I didn't want to.
I buried her on the cliff behind the house and built a small workshop over it.
I was always with Onaka.
You understand now?
Everything I did for my neighbors was in Onaka's memory.
I don't know about her husband and child.
Yet I made them sad too.
The only thing
I could do to make amends was to be useful to others.
But it has ended at last.
Onaka's come for me many times since yesterday.
Now we can be together again.
Onaka, you're beautiful.
You're very beautiful.
Come to me!
How nice.
Finally wearing your uniform?
It's really nice.
It's pretty difficult here, but if you want, you can learn a lot.
Useful in the future.
Exactly what Dr. Nori said.
Wish I could blush like that.
You'd make your man pale.
Next, Sadakichi.
Rest awhile. Up all night?
I'm all right. I'll help.
Doctor's taking you to see the outpatients.
I don't mind.
Yasuke!
Doctor's angry today.
Be careful.
What happened?
He can't treat the outpatients anymore.
The budget's been cut.
He got angry.
He'd consider the budget cut, but not neglecting the patients.
He asked the government to reconsider and then left, furious.
The government's irresponsible.
Don't worry.
He won't forget you.
Don't worry.
Excuse me.
I'm Masae.
There's something I must tell you.
I'm going out with the doctor.
Don't mind me.
Lord Matsudaira's mansion's first.
Come later.
I don't know what to say first.
It may be impudent of me to say anything, but l...
Everyone suffers as it is.
I wondered if you could forgive my sister...
There's nothing left to say about that.
And I'm busy today.
Pardon me.
Doctor!
A clinic doctor?
- Yes.
Please look at her!
Our doctor won't come!
My husband still owes him for medicine!
Such a high fever too!
Measles. Go to the clinic.
It's not far.
Helping people?
As I've said, you are not ill, my lord.
But you're in much worse condition.
It is due to a life of luxury and ease.
You indulge in rich food, hold nothing heavier than chopsticks.
Fat gathers, intake and discharge lose their balance.
Chamberlain, his menu?
The menu for the last three days.
I told you that white rice is detrimental to his health.
Well, l...
One bowl of seven parts wheat and three parts rice at each meal.
No fowl, meat or eggs.
And not too much fish or salt.
Keep to this for 100 days.
I would like to be paid now.
Yes. How much?
Fifty ryo.
Was it 30 ryo?
Yes.
Pardon my abrupt question, but is it true that doctors play no part in life and death?
It seems so.
Then people meant to live recover, those meant to die pass away?
Doctors have nothing to do with it?
It may mean that.
Bad and good doctors are the same, then?
Expensive medicines and those sold in pharmacies are the same?
Of course, an eminent doctor like yourself is different, I am sure.
Don't make me an exception.
Don't hold back.
Say what's on your mind.
I'm afraid I have displeased you.
Of course not.
All doctors have to butter up rich men.
Yasumoto, ever been to these places?
Yes, when I was in Nagasaki, about three times.
As a doctor or a guest?
A friend suggested going, but I didn't do anything.
I had a fiancée in Edo.
But during my absence, she...
I mean, she broke our engagement.
But I believed in her then, so these girls held no interest for me.
I said the wrong thing?
No.
I said to send that woman home.
She's the only one we have.
She doesn't entertain very often.
She has syphilis.
She mustn't entertain at all.
Will you pay me instead?
If we did like you said, we'd starve.
The food's no good in prison.
I'll stay!
I'd rather stay here!
Even if I did go home...
Do something about the girl instead!
She's 12.
She won't entertain, so...
Be still!
Keep your mouth shut.
Now, talk.
Say something!
Otoyo, apologize. Hurry!
What a girl! Spiteful!
Looking at me like that.
I'll show you.
- Stop it.
- What's that?
Why, Doctor.
Just leave this to me.
Just look at this!
Just look!
This brat! See?
She tore up the kimono I put on her.
What's the idea, dressing up this child?
I've done a lot for this Otoyo.
Her mother died out in front here.
She was no kin, but I gave the funeral and then took her in.
So I'm her foster mother!
No one can complain about what I do with her.
Again! Just to spite me!
Anything happens she doesn't like, back she goes to scrubbing again.
She has a fever.
See? Always contrary, returning spite for kindness.
A high fever.
We'll take her.
Are you joking?
Trying to get her for free? You!
Somebody! Somebody come!
What's up?
Anything wrong?
A thief!
He's trying to take her away.
Says she's sick.
Oh, no, you don't!
Who do you think you are? Sticking your nose in where you're not wanted.
Now get out!
Come again, and we'll show you.
I'm a doctor.
I come to see sick people.
What's that?
You better watch out!
You'll get hurt.
You be careful too.
You know, a bad doctor can kill you.
I won't kill you, but I might break a couple of arms or legs.
You! Outside!
Never mind. Don't interfere.
Shut the gate!
Get something to carry them away on.
Yasumoto, tend to them.
Bandage them up.
I'm afraid I went a bit too far.
I should've been more careful.
This is terrible.
Such violence is bad.
A doctor mustn't do such things.
Otoyo!
We're taking her.
Report it if you don't like it.
I don't understand.
No, I don't.
It's too cruel.
Why does such a child have to suffer so?
Her mind's far worse off than her body.
As though it had been scalded.
Yasumoto, you look after her.
She's your first patient.
Cure her.
I NTERMISSION
February 9... I bring Otoyo to my room.
Don't worry. Go to sleep.
No one will hurt you here.
Like some water?
That night, Otoyo, half awake, half dreaming,
looked at me so strangely.
February 10... Otoyo's mind has become clear.
But she won't let me examine her.
Just your tongue, then.
When she stares at me,
I don't know what to do.
Her eyes are suspicious,
insolent and very lonely.
February 11... when I woke up this morning...
What're you doing?
You're sick.
You needn't work here.
You needn't worry about food, clothes or medicine.
Stay in bed.
But she kept wiping, wiping, wiping
until she had convulsions again.
Now drink your medicine.
Drink it and your fever will go down.
How is she?
I give up.
She won't let me examine her, won't take her medicine.
I'll see what I can do.
Good girl.
That night, she spoke for the first time.
Now, eat this.
Your fever's down.
We must make you strong.
Why wasn't I slapped?
Why didn't he slap me?
You mean when you wouldn't take your medicine?
There are kind people in the world.
You've never met any before.
You can't fool me.
Mother told me.
She said to watch out for people, not to trust anyone.
And she was right.
No, no, he's not like that.
You know he isn't.
Isn't that why you took the medicine?
Dr. Niide wants to cure you, your body and your mind that's been so hurt by cruelty.
- You too?
- Of course me too.
Even now?
You poor girl!
You're really a nice girl.
February 12... Otoyo was gone again this morning.
She wasn't in the clinic.
I went to look for her.
Otoyo!
You begged to buy that dish for the one you broke last night?
Why did you have to beg for it?
Did I scold you about it?
I apologize if you thought so.
Forgive me.
I apologize.
How's the girl doing?
She ate her gruel and is fast asleep.
You rest too.
You've hardly slept since Sahachi died.
Those notes I borrowed.
I've copied what I needed.
For the patients, not me.
You may not like it, but try to understand.
I'm sorry for thinking only of myself.
I hated being here.
The father of the girl who betrayed me... I told you...
Dr. Amano?
Yes.
He won my father over and put me in here, trying to hush things up.
I couldn't forgive him, so...
Dr. Amano didn't do that.
I heard the story and suggested that.
I'm no good at all!
I'm selfish.
And self-satisfied.
How am I unfortunate?
Rokusuke and Sahachi were, but they died without complaint.
Look at Otoyo.
I'm so fortunate it's almost embarrassing.
I'm no good!
I blamed Chigusa and yet almost let that mad girl kill me.
I was vain, proud of being a doctor just back from Nagasaki.
I was too good for this clinic.
I even held you in contempt, despised you.
I'm a despicable man.
I'm conceited and insincere.
Yasumoto, you're tired.
Handayu!
Water.
I'm a good boy.
I'll take my medicine.
Sleep. Sleep some more.
I'm sorry. l...
You needn't apologize.
Thanks.
You nursed me, didn't you?
I remember, half in a dream.
But it's just because Doctor said to.
He said nursing you was the best thing for me too.
That's why.
Did it make you well?
I don't know.
But it felt nice nursing you.
Then I've gotten well too soon.
That's not so.
Your getting well is much nicer.
You're really well, then.
He's a great doctor.
No, a great man.
There are good people in this world too.
You're lucky to have met him.
But you are too.
Would you like...
You must eat.
I'll get some gruel.
How are you?
Thank you. Better, I think.
Masae is here.
Please come in.
It smells in here.
I was surprised to hear you were ill.
If there's anything I can do...
It's not serious.
He saw too much of the world at once.
Growing pains, you might say.
Your mother is not very well either.
Her palsy again?
Yes, and she's worried.
You haven't been home since you came here.
I'll be home when I'm up.
Please tell her so.
You don't seem to have been ill.
A bit leaner?
You look different.
Like a man who's just had a bath.
Father's away.
I wish he could see you now.
He entrusted you to Dr. Niide.
But really he was very worried.
Masae's been so good to me.
Like a true daughter ever since I took to bed.
She was just a child when I went away.
Beautiful now, isn't she?
I was wondering about her for you.
Father thinks everything would be fine if you'd agree to it.
I don't hold anything against Chigusa now.
But things aren't that easy.
You refuse?
The truth is, after it happened,
Dr. Amano, out of deference to you...
He forbade Chigusa to enter his home.
But she's just had a child.
His first grandchild.
He wants to acknowledge it.
That's why Masae came over?
Yes.
If you let bygones be bygones, he can openly acknowledge the child.
It's touching the way Masae is so thoughtful of others.
She even seems apologetic to me.
It's forward of me, but...
What is it?
It's for...
I heard she never left you while you were ill.
For Otoyo?
Yes, if it will do.
Hers is worn out.
I washed this and made it over.
Thank you.
Say you're sorry.
Hurry up.
What's gotten into you?
How can you throw what she gave you in the mud?
What a girl!
She makes me so mad!
Never mind.
What's happened?
Masae gave it to her, but when I handed it to her, she...
See here!
With that kimono you threw his kindness in the mud too.
How can you, when he got so sick nursing you?
Ungrateful girl.
Just look!
I won't look after her.
Dr. Niide said to take her in with us, and we were being as kind as we could.
She won't even talk to us!
Sullen all day long, just out of spite.
Don't say that.
The doctor says she's put up with more than we do in a lifetime.
She's sick.
Be kind and patient with her.
She was attached to Yasumoto once.
Why does she act like this now?
And doing this?
I know.
Otoyo's grown fond of Dr. Yasumoto.
She wants him all to herself.
But the young lady came to see him.
Isn't that when she became difficult again?
I'm sure she threw the kimono in the ditch because it had been hers.
Then she loves Dr. Yasumoto?
No, I rather think she just likes him.
I understand how she feels.
I see.
But isn't it lucky she didn't come to see Dr. Mori?
- You're impossible.
- Why?
Don't make me mad at you!
Osugi loves you.
Do something or she'll end up like that girl.
Say, you little rat!
Thief!
He got in it again.
- Little rat?
- A boy! A sneak thief!
He's awfully fast!
You little rat!
He got away again?
There's no helping this girl!
Pretending not to see it!
What's she thinking anyway?
It's about Otoyo.
Handayu told me.
She seems to be better.
Still difficult, but different from before.
She hated everyone before.
But now she doesn't know what to do with this sudden love for you.
Her feelings will include others one day.
We must wait for that.
It seems that they're all complaining she let the thief go, but the new kindness in her may have made her pretend not to see.
- What is it?
- The little rat's around here.
He's so fast.
I'm no match for him.
Please catch him, Doctor.
Where is he?
What is that?
They're for you.
Why?
I won't forget about the other day.
Here, take them.
I don't want them.
Take them. I had a hard time stealing them.
I hate thieves!
Why did you let me steal the gruel, then?
Gruel and candy are different.
You stole the gruel because you were awfully hungry?
I'm always hungry.
I'd become a beggar before I stole anything.
Not me.
Bowing to people.
No real man does such things.
How old are you?
Seven. I'm Chobo.
You're alone, Chobo?
I've got a father and mother.
Two brothers too.
Do they know that you steal?
They pretend they don't.
They're terrible people.
Don't say that.
They can't help it.
They're so poor that they've gotten stupid.
And my brothers are only children.
Aren't they older than you?
Nine and ten, and so hungry that they're always sucking their thumbs.
I wish I was a horse.
A horse? Why is that?
Horses eat grass.
We have plenty of that.
Give them here.
You'll take them, then?
I've accepted them.
What?
Now I give them to you.
Eat them with your brothers.
Go home now.
Come here every night.
I'll bring you our leftover rice.
Try not to steal if you can.
Eat some more.
One bowl's not enough for a growing girl.
That's enough!
You all eat too much!
Osugi?
I'm sorry, Master!
Forgive me!
Is that an excuse?
You were taking care of her.
I'm to blame!
I can't apologize enough!
What were you doing while she tried to hang herself?
I'm very sorry.
Answer me!
What were you doing?
Don't blame her.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have called her out.
A doctor and nurse making love, neglecting the patient.
After this, I see I put her in a terrible place.
My poor girl.
Yes, poor girl... for having such a father.
What's that?
A real father would ask about her first.
But I knew she'd recover, so...
Why don't you see her, then?
You're not looking after her.
You leave her entirely to others.
No, you're wrong.
You don't know how a parent feels.
The pain of having a sick girl.
I know how you feel, but I feel most sorry for Osugi.
You'd selfishly let her spend her youth shut in with your daughter.
She may be a maid, but you've no right to do it.
Your daughter's more and more sane now.
That's why she wanted to die.
Perhaps it was kinder to let her, but I'm a doctor.
What is it?
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm glad I left her with you.
Everything's fine now.
Listen, thank the doctor and let's go home.
What is it?
After you'd gone,
I thought it all over.
I've no one except you. You needn't do anything. Just stay with me.
Say what you will, we won't return her.
What?
How dare you say such a thing!
She was sick, but she's well now.
I'm taking her!
She'll get sick again.
Listen to you. These clothes.
Same old tattered kimono.
Don't act big!
Wait! I'm taking her!
Don't touch her.
Your hand will rot.
Rot? What do you mean?
You're rotten to the core!
Smell yourself! Sickening!
What's this? I'm not!
Your nose must have rotted too!
I have a nice kimono!
I like it here!
I'm staying here!
What? What's that kimono?
I'll tie you up and carry you.
No, you won't.
She's our girl! Get out!
An old woman, all painted up.
Join the freak show.
Go away, you hussy.
Try and make me.
I won't budge till I get her.
All right, beat her up.
You hit me on the head!
You!
It won't break.
Do it again.
I'll break it open!
I made rice balls for you today.
- You needn't have.
- Why?
We're going somewhere nice.
- Where?
- It's far away.
But we don't have to worry about food and it's fun there.
You've a rich relative far away?
That's about it.
It's not too cold or too hot there.
Flowers bloom all the time.
And lots of pretty birds
I've never seen.
My father and mother said so.
Is there a place like that?
Yes, there is... to the west.
You're awfully pretty today.
I bet the birds where we go will be pretty too.
Good-bye.
Don't move!
I won't be seeing you again.
Don't move. Let me see you good.
You're pretty. Awfully pretty.
Yasumoto... I saw Dr. Amano yesterday after a long time.
He asked me to stop by to talk about you.
About me?
Dr. Amano's worked hard for you.
You'll be the shogun's doctor in March.
But... please wait!
He also asked if you'd marry the younger daughter.
That's all.
What is it?
Why look at me like that?
You've changed.
Not so long ago, you raved you were leaving.
What of it?
I'm staying, no matter what.
That's all!
What's funny?
You even talk like Dr. Niide now.
By the way, what about Masae?
Nothing.
Like her?
Or don't you like her?
I don't dislike her.
Then you like her.
Say what you mean.
- You say what you mean.
- What?
About Osugi. What'll you do?
My mind's made up.
I'll propose in due time.
You make up your mind too.
Doctor, hurry!
A whole family's been brought in.
They drank poison.
It's that little boy's family.
Poor souls!
It's not Chobo.
Doctor, will Chobo live?
Where's Chobo?
Doctor, at least save that boy.
He threw up the poison.
He'll live if he lasts till morning.
He wants to see you.
Come.
It's too much... that little rat taking rat poison.
Otoyo's here.
But don't talk too long.
I'm sorry.
I stole again and I got caught.
I should've become a beggar like you said.
I'm sorry.
Never mind.
Don't talk now.
No, I've got to.
I've got to say it now.
It was all my fault.
They said it was the end to have a thief in our home.
So we all decided to die together.
I'm sorry I lied about going to a nice place.
Water. Give me water.
Sip it.
Slowly.
Yes, slowly.
That's enough for now. You'll be able to drink all you want soon.
Please let the boy die.
It's best for him.
Doctor, why did you have to save us?
We thought it over and decided it was best.
We talked it over with the boys.
They said it was best too, so we all drank the medicine.
So why didn't everyone leave us alone?
He thinks he's dead already.
Since we married,
I've never seen him sleeping so peacefully.
Doctor, don't people breathe like that when they're dying?
I know! Mother did too!
Please do something!
What's that?
The cooks are calling Chobo back.
There's a belief that if you call into the well, you can call a dying person back.
Wells lead to the bottom of the earth.
What're you doing?
It's almost dawn.
Yes, he won't die if he lasts till dawn.
All the poison's out of Chobo now.
Tell everyone that he'll pull through.
It's too sudden.
There's no need for a private ceremony.
We'll marry in March.
Then why can't we have it today?
- But...
- Please.
Dr. Amano expects it too.
It's a load off your father's shoulders too, so...
Always making plans without asking.
I have my own ideas.
Yasumoto, how long are you keeping
Masae waiting in the corridor?
No, that's Masae's place.
You sit over here.
Look this way.
All ready? I'll have them bring the nuptial cups.
Please, I'd like to say something, Doctor.
The groom's not supposed to talk now.
I'd like to tell her something first.
Thanks to your father, I'm to become the shogun's doctor in March.
I once hoped to be promoted to head doctor.
But not now.
I'll remain at the clinic.
It means no honor and no money.
We will be poor.
You do not mind? Please think.
That's enough.
The cups.
Aren't you Chigusa?
You've had a baby?
Is he well?
Thank you.
You must think me foolish, but I can hold my own grandchild now.
Thank you very much.
Fine.
Now, the cups.
Do you want me to shout at you?
Please do.
I'll stay no matter what.
- Who says so?
- You did.
You taught me the road to take.
So I will take it.
You overestimate me.
Something's the matter with you.
Have you forgotten about the magistrate, about Matsudaira and Izumiya?
I do things like that.
I like you for that.
You're a fool!
I owe it to you.
You're young, so you talk like that.
You'll regret it.
So you give me your permission?
I repeat: You'll regret it!
I'll have to find that out myself.
Thank you.
THE END
Just you wait, it won't be long
The man in black will soon be here
With his cleaver's blade so true
He'll make mincemeat out of you!
You're out.
I told you to stop singing that awful song!
Didn't you hear me?
That same cursed song over and over!
Dear me, that's heavy.
What's the matter?
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song, but they sing it all day long.
As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer already.
Ah, leave 'em alone.
As long as we can hear 'em singing, at least we know they're still there.
Yes, I guess you're right.
PUBLIC SCHOOL
10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara have been missing since June 11th.
Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the Doering siblings".
What a pretty ball you have there.
What's your name?
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come with you?
No, she didn't.
Pretty!
Thank you.
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.
Have you seen little Elsie?
No. Didn't she just come up the stairs?
No, she's not home yet.
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke.
Extra! Extra!
Extra! Extra!
No, I can't give change!
Extra!
Makes you afraid to send your kids to school!
Who is the murderer?
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
10,000 marks' reward.
- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!
The print's too small.
We can't read it.
You in front, read it out loud!
- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!
"The terror in our town has found a new victim".
Louder!
We can't hear a word!
"Certain evidence leads us to believe
that this is the same murderer
who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
We must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
A little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom".
Very true!
Keep reading.
"Anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
But the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
Who is the murderer?'
What does he look like?
Where is he hiding?
No one knows him, yet he is among us.
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer".
Yes, that's very true.
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.
What do I know very well?
Think about it.
It'll come to you.
What are you saying?
I saw you follow that little girl from the fourth floor up the stairs.
You're crazy, you dirty swine!
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?
You bastard! You swine!
Murderer!
Gentlemen!
I'll see you in court!
I'll have you locked up!
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!
And the police fall for it!
A search warrant!
How awful! What a disgrace!
Searching a man's house based on an anonymous letter!
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.
As if it weren't enough that we're in constant fear for our kids!
You see? That's why the police must follow up every lead.
Any man on the street could be the murderer.
Can you please tell me what time it is?
Yes, my child.
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?
What's it to you where the kid lives?
Excuse me?
What do you want with that kid?
Absolutely nothing!
What do you want with me?
I'll show you what I want!
Let me go!
This is an outrage!
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face! then acting like a big shot!
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!
Call the police!
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!
What? Is he the murderer?
Break it up!
Come on, move along!
- The murderer!
- The monster!
Get him!
Tackle him!
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
This is a terrible scandal!
Imagine the effect such a note will have on the public, Commissioner!
This is simply irresponsible!
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
This severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
The lab's working on it right now.
Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard
that's passed through so many hands.
Nevertheless, we will leave no stone unturned.
We'll painstakingly compare the results against our archives
in hopes of finding something that can be used to solve this case.
Then we'll send the letter to our graphologist.
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps, clearly seen in the word 'soon', third line from the bottom..."
You got that?
- Yes.
"...attest to the strongly pathological sexuality of this sex offender.
Period.
The partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation,
a form of acting
which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
The writing as a whole displays
elusive yet unmistakable signs
of madness".
Yes, of course, Commissioner.
I have no doubt you're doing your job, and your men as well.
But we need results!
Results!
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!
My riot squads don't get a moment's peace.
They report for duty almost more fatigued than when they were dismissed,
because the painstaking nature of their work wears on the nerves,
and 80% - if not 90% - of our leads are false.
The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.
They're constantly on call, always tense and alert,
ever ready to spring into action,
to follow even the slightest lead,
as it just might be the one that solves the case.
Mr. Secretary, just consider the search of the crime scene.
To give you an example:
In the bushes just behind a picket fence,
a small, white, crumpled paper wrapping was found.
It apparently once contained inexpensive sweets.
In the outermost corner
were found traces of fruit drops
and particles of powdered sugar.
We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper
in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half,
but all to no avail.
With each passing day we expand the area searched.
But, of course, after such a long time,
no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
Despite all these setbacks,
we're forced to press on in our investigation,
always in uncertainty,
and with little chance of success
in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
Our men are doing everyth...
What good is all this?
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!
And the police are getting nowhere!
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
Do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
Let me give you a random example:
"Testimony 1,478 in the Beckmann murder case..."
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!
Gentlemen!
You must at least know the color of the cap the little girl wore whom you say you saw with the stranger!
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!
- It was green!
- Red!
Stop! This is pointless!
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!
Next witness.
If you rely on a color-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
In their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1,500 detailed leads.
The files in this case fill 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched all our forces
to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched,
every bush examined,
since any bush or hollow could harbor some object
that could finally set us on the right track.
We called in police dogs.
We set the best trackers on the faintest of traces,
but they lost the scent
and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
Since the first murders,
the police have searched homeless shelters night after night,
subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
This does not, of course, make the police very popular,
nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
Railway stations are kept under surveillance around the clock.
Still, the investigation has not yet yielded the slightest results,
nor have nightly raids in the criminal districts.
The cops!
Get back!
Back!
- This is the police!
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn bastard!
Put me down!
Let me go!
Let her go, you filthy pig!
Quiet!
Move back!
The top fuzz!
Quiet!
Police orders:
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.
Please!
Come now, children, stop this foolishness.
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!
Quiet!
That'll get you nowhere.
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!
Quiet!
Be reasonable now!
Step back!
You hear me? Step back!
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!
- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.
Please let me go, Inspector!
The two guys who tried to escape were caught on the Krangasse.
- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!
Have your papers ready!
Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?
Off to the precinct again!
Haven't even made a buck tonight!
Anyone without papers goes down to the precinct!
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!
Stop talking nonsense!
- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!
- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?
Don't push.
Everyone will get their turn.
- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!
Have your papers ready!
Your papers.
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate around with me everywhere!
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!
The precinct for you!
You make me puke!
Shoddy work, my friend.
You've been had.
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!
Ah, lay off!
Next.
Stuck-up snob.
What's wrong?
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S
We'd better take you down to the precinct too.
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.
Move on.
Move on!
Ah, tough luck!
Next.
Papers.
- Don't got none.
To the precinct.
Just my luck.
Next, come on.
You're ruining my business, Sarge.
These raids every night.
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.
You think... we stay up all night just for the hell of it?
No.
But you're drivin' away my clientele, and you won't find the guy you're lookin' for here anyway.
If you knew how steamed they are at the guy who's causing these raids.
Especially the girls.
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.
But believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
I know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
If they ever get their hands on that monster, they'll make toothpicks out of him!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
So long.
They hit the Crocodile Club today.
Two paddy wagons.
What's keeping Safecracker?
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
The exact time, please, miss.
2:58. Thank you.
The cops are crawling the streets like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They're on your back even if you're with a broad.
They've gone nuts... got this murderer on the brain.
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl, and every night I have to check under the bed to see if the murderer's hiding there.
You can't do business anymore for tripping over cops everywhere.
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.
What else is new?
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?
That guy? Come on.
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in London.
There he was, hands up, back to the wall, cops all around him.
Seconds later there were three men dead on the ground, but he wasn't one of 'em!
No one better from Berlin to San Francisco.
They've been after him six years and they've yet to get him.
Not yet. But put enough dogs on the fox's tail...
Can it!
Damn it!
I can't take this!
He was always right on time before.
- Thank God!
- Finally.
Morning!
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.
I declare all division leaders of this organization present.
I assume you're authorized to make binding decisions for your divisions.
Good. We'll dispense with the preliminaries, as we all know why we're here.
An outsider is ruining our business and our reputation.
Measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, café or even private home from the clutches of the police.
Very true.
This state of affairs must end.
Things must return to normal or we'll go under.
Our coffers will soon be depleted.
If we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
I don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
Our reputation is suffering as well.
The police seek the murderer in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on into an officer from the squad, he knows the potential risks, and so do I.
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.
But we must draw a firm line between ourselves and this man they're looking for!
We conduct our business in order to survive, but this monster has no right to survive!
He must be killed, eliminated, exterminated!
Without mercy or compassion!
Gentlemen, our members must be able to go about their business again without frantic cops in their way at every turn.
I invite...
...your views, gentlemen.
Step up ID checks, comb the entire city, and raids... relentless, ever tougher raids!
We need informers!
We must know the police's plans almost before they do themselves!
The girls gotta work the cops more!
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?
Now they can rat on the cops!
Every resident, every landlord, every property owner must be forced to consent to meticulous searches of his property for the slightest of clues.
What if we...
We have our connections.
What if we put an article in the papers that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization... doesn't wish to be lumped in together with this pig, and that the cops should look for this guy somewhere else.
He's not even a real crook!
This man may well be... when not engaged in the actual act of killing... a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
Without what I'll call the innocuousness of these murderers' private lives, it's inconceivable that someone like Grossmann or Haarmann could have lived right next door to their neighbors for years without arousing the faintest trace of suspicion!
This is where we must focus the public's attention.
The public must cooperate.
I'll tell you about public cooperation!
Just thinking of it makes me puke.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
But ain't it the truth?
What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!
Very true.
They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
That's right.
But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.
Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.
There's your public cooperation for you!
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.
It can't really be that bad, can it?
But it is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still takes the position,
"How does this concern me?"
The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!
I've got another idea.
There was this magician.
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.
Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.
The reward is still far too little money.
The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.
None of this is anything new.
This is all leading nowhere.
So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.
The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.
These children vanish without a trace.
And when they're found...
Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.
No, we'll go broke by then.
What, then?
We have to catch him... ourselves.
Yes, that's what we must do.
There is perhaps one other way.
I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.
Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.
We must cover the city with a net of informers.
Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.
No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.
- Fine, but how?
- And who?
It must be people who can go anywhere without causing a stir, follow anyone without attracting attention, follow any child to any house without arousing suspicion.
In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.
- But who?
- There are no such people!
- Who could do that?
- Who?
The beggars.
The organization of beggars!
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT
Blood pudding's on the upswing.
God, this cheese stinks so good.
Take that, you sons of bitches!
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.
Two, four, six...
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS
SANDWICHES
Bread-and-butter sandwich, lukewarm response.
Black Friday for roast beef.
All right.
Now come the courtyards.
Yes, from number 1 to 88.
Next.
You're responsible for the courtyards on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.
Got it.
What's next?
Hauptstrasse, from number 89... to 196.
Hauptstrasse, number 89 to 196.
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.
Well, Emil, maybe you'll win the 15,000.
I've got my fingers crossed.
Knock on wood.
My heartfelt thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
"In searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the Courier.
Be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table..."
Idiot!
"...or red pencil..."
Come in.
"... or writing paper of the type used by the killer".
Inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
Reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
And here's a list of their present addresses.
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Pardon me?
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.
You don't say.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.
I had hoped to speak with him.
I'm from the tax office.
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...
Yes, thank you.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.
THE GENERAL GAZETTE
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler, does Mr. Beckert subscribe to any newspapers?
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.
I see. Thank you.
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!
Child, you mustn't do that.
You know why.
Good day.
What would you like?
Coffee.
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.
Here you are.
Another.
Check.
Two cognacs... that's 1.65, please.
Thank you very much.
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.
Table: polished mahogany, with tablecloth.
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.
Printed matter found in wastebasket: cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and "Regards, Paul" on it, but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand, a bag of candy...
Just a moment.
Ariston?
What was that?
I'd like the file on the Marga Perl murder case.
Thank you very much.
That's odd.
I've heard that before.
It was...
It was...
Hey, Heinrich!
What is it?
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.
Can't you hear it?
There.
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy who was whistling?
Yes, I can still see him.
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street.
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?
The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
He was with a little girl... and he whistled just like that!
Damn it, man!
Are you crazy, throwing orange peels on the ground?
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!
I should report you to the police!
Outrageous behavior!
Hey, mister.
Aha! Here it is.
"In a 150-foot radius of the crime scene, three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand were found". There you have it.
Yes, it may be the same brand of cigarettes, but there was no old wooden table.
Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else.
Good God!
The window ledge!
You're right.
Just a minute.
Red pencil.
My God, finally!
We're finally on his trail.
What?
They're on his trail?
- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.
Shut up!
What did you say?
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.
His every move is being watched.
- Mister.
- What is it?
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?
On your shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.
Out of the question!
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!
Maybe he's hiding inside the building.
Closing time!
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...
They're starting to come out!
Out in the street, and keep your eyes peeled!
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...
The boss came to my office today...
Turn off the light.
He'll get suspicious if he comes home and sees it on.
What time is it, anyway?
Almost 6:30.
He's gotta still be inside!
He definitely didn't come out with the office crowd.
No, just a moment.
The beggars have called for backup and surrounded the whole building.
They figure the guy's hiding in the building.
What sort of building is it?
What sort of building is it?
Nothing but offices.
I don't know what's in the basement.
There's a branch of the local savings bank on the ground floor, and the second to sixth floors are nothing but offices.
Above that is the attic space.
This is unbelievable.
Anyone still in there?
Anyone still in here?
What the devil!
Anybody still in here?
Damn carelessness!
All that trouble for one door.
Seems the guy's cornered now.
I think we should tip the cops off right away.
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!
Stay by the phone and call back in a few minutes.
What is it?
Are you crazy or something?
The police?
No! We're gonna get this guy ourselves!
Listen, the time now is...
All right. 9:00... 10:00...
At 11:00!
Evening. Did you know your gate isn't closed?
What? That's impossible!
Why I just... Wait, it is!
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!
Come on! Move it!
Let's go!
Come on, move it!
How many other watchmen are in the building?
Don't want to answer, eh?
Very well.
There are still two watchmen on their rounds.
Goddamn it!
Damn piece of crap!
Goddamned lock!
Damn it to hell!
Shit!
Careful where you shine those lights!
And don't stomp around like elephants!
He's not in the basement.
We went through it all and found nothing.
Two men are still going through the boiler room.
Hold it!
This is the last one.
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.
Safecracker sent me.
All right.
Listen carefully.
This is a new type of time clock.
Here's a general diagram.
If they're not set at exactly the right minute, an alarm automatically goes off at the nearest police station. Get it?
You got it?
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...
He's not in the boiler room or the coal room.
We turned over every piece of coal.
Hey!
Are you nuts?
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?
We gotta get in if we're gonna search the whole place!
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go through the ceiling of the office above!
Nothing.
All right. Down we go.
Hey, what's up?
Hey! What is it?
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?
Wait, damn it!
I've gotta see Safecracker!
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!
Quiet!
Go on! He has to be in there!
Here's the light switch.
Force the locks.
Come on. Hurry up!
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!
I heard someone banging, and I told Safecracker.
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.
Just came down to fill you in.
If I hadn't been alert, we could've looked for him for hours!
The watchman!
Three... one... four.
- Everybody out!
- What?
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!
Hold it!
Quiet down!
Five more minutes, six more storage sheds.
Move it! Get going!
Not like that!
Out of the way!
- He's not in here.
- Next door!
Come on! Faster!
- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!
Quickly! We've only got three minutes left!
No padlock on this one... he must be here!
Open it!
- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!
Hurry! Only one minute left!
There he is, the dog!
Come on! Move it!
Everybody out!
Get out while you can, damn it!
Move it!
For Christ's sake, get going!
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!
If not, they might as well stay here, with or without the guy!
What in the hell is keeping them?
Finally! Thank God!
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?
Hey, who pulled up the rope?
Bunch of morons!
Hello there.
Hands up!
How can I put my hands up when I'm holding on to the rope?
Come out of there!
I'm really innocent this time...
...like a newborn babe.
This may surprise you, Franz... but I believe you.
Then everything's in order, and I can go now, right?
Just a moment.
Cigarette?
Uh-oh.
I'll take your word for it, Franz... provided... you can tell me... who the man was that you were looking for and that you found in that building.
I don't understand, Inspector.
A man, you say?
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.
I know nothing.
Nothing at all.
Of course.
There's just one thing I don't get: why you're covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch.
Fine friends, running off when things heat up, leaving you right in the fire.
Phooey!
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.
Listen...
What can happen to me anyway?
Maybe a little property damage... so what?
Nothing was pinched!
But something was pinched, my friend!
In fact, a good deal.
What? Something got pinched?
How much?
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same.
I already told you.
I know nothing.
Very well.
Give it some thought, Franz.
Leave a man alone for a couple hours... and a lot comes back to him that he couldn't remember before.
Take him away.
Send the night watchman in.
Mr. Damowatz.
Please sit down.
Now then, you said in your statement...
Listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.
Good.
Go home now and recover from your ordeal.
But please remain available for further questioning.
Of course, Inspector.
Good morning, Inspector.
Morning.
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann in the building?
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll come over myself.
What? I see.
Hasn't come home yet, eh?
Did you keep an eye on the old Winkler woman too?
Come in.
Come in!
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.
Listen, the whole block is surrounded.
If he decides to go home, he has to run into us.
So just keep on waiting.
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.
Damn it!
What do you want?
I wanted... to ask a favor of you.
Dishwater again!
I wanted to ask you...
Read this first.
- A statement?
- Yeah.
An office building was broken into.
Bennostrasse?
That's a respectable part of town.
Perhaps not that respectable after all.
Hell, this is getting serious!
What the... Did they mean to empty the whole joint?
What could they have been looking for in the coal?
Incredible! Unbelievable!
I'll be damned!
This is madness!
Ah, so they were after the savings bank!
Good God!
What could this mean?
I don't understand at all.
They didn't even touch it?
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!
I'll be damned!
Isn't that something?
Nothing stolen, but a man was carried off.
God knows where they took him.
That's just great.
And Franz isn't talking.
He's afraid, of course.
I know him well. Guy like him would rather jump out the fifth-floor window than be mixed up in a murder rap.
What if we could get at him from that angle?
Lohmann, if you'd be willing to help me out...
Very clever.
I see the wheels turning.
Let's send for this Franz.
You're wanted for questioning.
What? They sent four guys for me?
What's this about?
- Move it!
"Homicide squad.
Inspector Karl Lohmann".
What do you want with me?
What have I got to do with the homicide squad?
Yes, young man... your case has been turned over to me.
But why?
Why?
You boys did your work a little too well.
One of the watchmen...
Dead?
Accessory to murder.
Nasty business.
Inspector, I've had enough!
I want no part of this!
I'll tell you everything I know!
Very sensible, but, unfortunately, too late.
It can't be too late!
It can't be!
I'll tell you everything!
Even what we were looking for in that damn building.
Well...
The child murderer!
What?
Who?
The child murderer, Inspector.
Just a moment.
This had to happen to me!
Me, of all people.
Come sit down, my boy.
We're gonna level with each other, got it?
Certainly, Inspector.
And God help you if you pull something.
Now then... what have you boys got to do with the murderer, and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector... you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?
The one that went belly-up in the Depression?
That's the one.
Since then, the building's stood empty, and no one gives a damn about it.
Get out here! Move it!
Let me go!
What have I done to you?
You swine!
Let go of me!
Bastards!
Swine!
What do you want from me?
What do you want...
Help!
Help! Let me out of here!
I want out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
Gentlemen, I beg of you!
I don't even know what you want with me.
I beg you, let me go.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
No.
No mistake.
Out of the question.
This is no mistake.
No.
No mistake.
You recognize this?
You bought a balloon just like this for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just like this one.
No!
Where did you bury little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But I never...
I never even met her!
You never even met her!
I suppose you never met her either, huh?
Or her?
You never met her either, huh?
- Stop him!
- Grab him!
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!
Watch out! The door!
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!
Let go of me!
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right? There's only one thing right for a man like you... death!
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!
Quiet!
Kill him!
You spoke of "right" just now.
We will be your right.
Everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison... to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They'll make sure you get your rights.
You'll even have defense counsel.
Everything according to the letter of the law.
Defense counsel?
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?
You, perhaps?
Hey, you.
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.
Your head's at stake here, in case you hadn't noticed.
And just who are you?
I have the dubious pleasure of serving as your defense.
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good.
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?
We simply want to put you out of commission.
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead.
But you can't murder me just like that!
I demand to be handed over to the police!
I demand to be brought before a real court of law!
That's a good one!
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!
So you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
And then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity... and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!
But I can't help it!
I can't...
I really can't... help it!
We know that one!
Before the judge, we all "can't help it".
What would you know?
What are you talking about?
Who are you anyway?
Who are you?
All of you.
Criminals.
Probably proud of it, too... proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
All of which it seems to me you could just as easily give up if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy pigs.
But me?
Can I do anything about it?
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me?
This fire, this voice, this agony?
So you mean to say...
you have to kill?
I have to roam the streets endlessly, always sensing that someone's following me.
It's me!
I'm shadowing myself!
Silently... but I still hear it!
Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm tracking myself down.
I want to run... run away from myself!
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!
I must take the path that it's driving me down and run and run down endless streets!
I want off!
And with me run the ghosts of the mothers and children.
They never go away.
They're always there!
Always!
Always!
Except... when I'm doing it... when I...
Then I don't remember a thing.
Then I'm standing before a poster, reading what I've done.
I read and read...
I did that?
I don't remember a thing!
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like inside me?
How it screams and cries out inside me when I have to do it!
Don't want to! Must!
Don't want to! Must!
And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen anymore!
Help! I can't!
I can't!
The accused has stated that he can't help himself.
In other words, he must commit murder.
With that he has pronounced his own death sentence.
Right!
A man who claims that he's compelled to destroy the lives of others... such a man must be extinguished like a bonfire!
Such a man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
May I address the court?
Counsel for the defense has the floor.
My learned colleague who just spoke... who is, if I'm not mistaken, wanted by the police on three counts of manslaughter...
That's irrelevant here. has claimed that the fact that my client was acting compulsively warrants the death sentence.
That's right!
He is mistaken, because the very nature of compulsion warrants an acquittal!
Get outta here, will ya?
Are you nuts, or plastered?
It is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
And a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I'm saying that this man is sick, and you turn a sick man over to a doctor, not an executioner.
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?
And one fine day the killing starts all over?
Another month-long manhunt!
Once again the insanity clause, once again the asylum!
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely?
No one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
Not even the state, and all of you least of all!
The state must ensure that this man is rendered harmless so that he ceases to be a danger to society!
You never had kids, did ya?
Then you never lost any either.
But if you wanna know what it's like when a little child is taken from you, just ask the parents whose kids he took away!
Ask 'em about the days and nights not knowing what had happened, and later, when they finally found out...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy from any of them for murdering their kids?
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!
No mercy for the killer!
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!
- Kill him!
- Waste him!
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!
I will not let you shout me down!
I will not allow a murder to be committed in my presence.
I demand that this human being...
That's not a human being! that this human being be afforded the same protection under the law rendered the common criminal!
Not a chance!
I demand that he be handed over to the police!
The police!
Of all the dumb...
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not bring our children back.
One has to... keep closer watch... over the children!
All of you!
Harry, answer that.
What do you want to hack for, Bickle?
I can't sleep nights.
- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.
What do you do now?
Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, busses.
Figure if I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.
Wanna work uptown nights,
South Bronx, Harlem?
- I'll work anytime, anywhere.
- Will you work Jewish holidays?
Anytime, anywhere.
Let me see your chauffeur's license.
- How's your drivin' record?
- It's real clean, like my conscience.
You gonna break my chops? Trouble with guys like you breaking my chops.
If you're gonna break my chops, you can take it on the arches. Understand?
Sorry, sir.
I didn't mean that.
- Physical?
- Clean.
- Age?
- Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here, there. You know.
Military record?
Honorable discharge, May 1973.
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.
I was in the Marines, too.
So what is it?
You need an extra job?
Are you moonlighting?
Well, I just want to work long hours.
What's moonlighting?
Fill out these forms and check back tomorrow when the shift breaks.
O'Brien, please step up.
Take the car to 58th street, please,
'cause it's crowded on 57th.
All right, I'm comin' down there.
Let's go.
May 10.
Thank God for the rain... which has helped wash away the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.
I'm working long hours now.
6:00 in the afternoon to 6:00, sometimes 8:00 in the morning.
Six days a week, sometimes seven days a week.
It's a long hustle, but if keeps me real busy.
I can take in 300, 350 a week, sometimes more when I do if off the meter.
All the animals come out at night.
Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.
Sick, venal.
Someday a real rain will come and wash this scum off the streets.
I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, to Harlem.
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.
If does to some. Some won't even take spooks. Don't make no difference to me.
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.
Man, you're a gorgeous, brown, beautiful little girl!
- I can't afford to get stopped.
- No, we wouldn't want that to happen.
Be a big tip for you, you do the right things.
You got a way.
You got a way.
Now you're talkin'.
Driver, hurry up, will ya?
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.
Each night when I return the cab, I have to clean the come off the backseat.
Some nights
I clean off the blood.
Can I help you?
Yeah, what's your name?
My name is Travis.
That's nice.
What can I do for you?
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?
Gimme a break.
You can tell me your name.
I'm not gonna do anything.
- Want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to call the manager.
- Troy!
- All right, okay.
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?
You have any Jujus? They last longer.
I'd like to get some.
What you see is what we got.
I'll take these.
Coca-Cola.
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.
Twelve hours of work, and I still can't sleep.
Damn!
The days go on and on.
They don't end.
All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go.
I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.
I believe that someone should become a person like other people.
I first saw her at Palantine Campaign
Headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.
She was wearing a white dress.
She appeared like an angel.
Out of this filthy mass... she is alone.
They cannot... touch her.
Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes.
I think it's a total of 5,000 campaign buttons.
Now, all the ones we had before... our slogan is "We are the people," and "are" is underlined.
These new buttons have "we" underlined.
That reads "We are the people."
There's a difference.
"We are the people" is not the same as "We are the people."
Let's not fight.
Look, we'll make it real simple.
We don't pay for the buttons.
We throw the buttons away, all right?
Come here a minute.
What?
This canvas report is ready. If Andy okays it, send copies to headquarters.
I gotta get that New York Times article Xeroxed.
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget.
We have to emphasize the mandatory welfare program.
-That's the issue that should be pushed.
-First push the man, then the issue.
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.
An intelligent, interesting, fresh--
- You forgot sexy.
- I did not forget sexy.
Listen. You sound like you're selling mouthwash.
- We are selling mouthwash.
- Are we authorized to do that?
Very funny.
We can get in trouble for selling pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.
My uncle's in jail because of that.
It's not really jail. 'Course living with his wife, anything would be jail.
- Look over there.
- I love you.
- Notice anything?
- No.
- Put your glasses on.
- Okay. Just a minute. All right.
That taxi driver's been staring at us.
What taxi driver?
The one that's sitting there.
- How long has he been there?
- It feels like a long time.
Does he bother you?
You really mean yes, and you're being sarcastic.
You're really quick.
I try to be real quick.
Tell you what. I'll play the male in this relationship--
Good luck.
I'll tell him to move.
I don't need good luck. Thank you.
Yes, you do.
You just think you don't.
You're blocking our doorway.
Think you might wanna move the cab?
Eye shadow, mascara...
Lipstick, rouge.
Not rouge. "Blush-on" they call it.
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah. It's blush-on.
- Travis!
- Hey, Wizard.
That's blush-on.
My wife uses it.
Ask Travis.
He's a ladies' man.
Yeah. Cup of coffee, please.
Whatever the fuck it is, she uses a lot of it.
Then perfume, the spray kind.
Get this. In the middle of the Triborough Bridge--
This woman is beautiful.
She changes her pantyhose.
No. What did you do?
I threw the meter, I jump in the backseat, whip it out... and I said,
"You know what this is?"
She says, "It's love."
I fuck her brains out.
She goes wild.
She said, "It's the greatest single experience of my life."
She gave me a $200 tip and her phone number in Acapulco.
Travis, you know Doughboy,
Charlie T. ?
Got change for a nickel?
We call him Doughboy
'cause he'll do anything for a buck.
So, how's it hangin'?
What's happenin'?
I heard on the radio some fleet driver from Bell just got all cut up.
Stickup?
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.
- Cut half his ear off.
- Where?
They said 122nd Street.
Fuckin' mau-mau land.
You run all over town, don't you?
Travis?
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.
You handle some pretty rough customers, huh?
Yeah, I have.
You carry a piece?
You need one?
If you ever need one, I know a fellow that can get you a real nice deal.
Lots of shit around.
I never use mine.
I'm conservative.
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.
Well, I'm gonna go do my dirt.
Look.
A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.
Dig the symbols.
"F-4-0-5-4-3-4."
The watermark.
There's one person.
There's two persons, and there's three persons.
I got this at his estate,
The Pines.
Why don't you take it? lf you can sell it, you give me half of what you got.
I don't want it.
Well. I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Nothing!
- That's very cute. Thank you.
Want to see something?
Wait. I just typed,
"You want to see something?" What?
If you had these three fingers missing on this hand... and that hand missing on that hand... how would you light a match?
- I wouldn't light a match.
- Go ahead, give it a try.
I don't think I could do it.
No?
It's gonna be difficult.
I'll give it a try.
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.
Just a minute.
I can't do it.
The guy at the newsstand can do it.
I don't work at a newsstand.
- He's probably Italian. You sure?
- He's black.
If he had been Italian, he might have been a thief. The mob does that.
If a thief screws up on the job, they'll blow his fingers off.
I'll tell you something else.
This sounds like a joke, but it's true.
If they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary, you can walk into a pet store.
As long as you pay for it, boom.
Kill it right there. Put it on anyone.
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you over here.
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.
Why do you feel you have to volunteer to me?
Because I think you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?
Well, l--
Charles Palantine, the man you're volunteering to help elect president.
I'm sure he'll make a good president.
I don't know his policies... but I'm sure he'll make a good one.
- You want to canvas?
- I'll canvas.
How do you feel about the senator's stand on welfare?
I don't know the senator's stand, but I'm sure it's a good stand.
- Are you sure of that?
- Yeah.
We all work together here full-time, day and night.
If you would step over there,
I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.
I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me to work in the day.
- Then what exactly do you want?
- Would you have coffee and pie with me?
Why?
Why? I'll tell you why.
I think you're a lonely person.
I drive by this place, I see you here.
I see a lot of people around you... and I see all these phones and this stuff on your desk.
That means nothing.
When I came inside and met you...
I saw in your eyes and in the way you carried yourself... that you're not a happy person.
I think you need something.
If you want to call it a friend, you can call it a friend.
You gonna be my friend?
Yeah.
What do you say?
It's hard standing here and asking you, so--
Five minutes. That's all.
Just outside, right around here.
I'm there to protect you.
Come on.
Just take a little break.
I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here--
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.
- All right. 4:00 p.m.?
- Right.
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.
Okay. My name is Travis.
Betsy?
- Travis.
- Yeah.
I appreciate this, Betsy.
May 26, 4:00 p.m.
I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop on Columbus Circle.
I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted cheese.
I think that was a good selection.
Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad... but she could've had anything she wanted.
Fifteen thousand volunteers is not bad, but the organizational problems!
I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.
I gotta get organized. Little things like my apartment, possessions.
I should get a sign : "One of these days
I should get 'organezized."'
- You mean organized?
- "Organezized."
Organezized. It's a joke.
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-l-Z-E-D.
Oh, you mean organezized like those office signs that say "Thimk."
Do you like the place you work in?
We've got some good people, and
I think Palantine's got a good chance.
You have beautiful eyes.
Do you like the guy you work with?
He's okay.
Yeah, but do you like him?
He's funny and he's very good at his job.
He's okay.
He does have a few problems.
He has quite a few problems.
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.
When I walked in and saw you two sitting there...
I could tell by the way you related there was no connection whatsoever.
I felt when I walked in that there was something between us.
There was an impulse that we were both following.
So that gave me the right to come in and talk to you.
Otherwise, I never would have felt
I had the right to talk to you.
I never would have had the courage to talk to you.
With him, I felt there was nothing, and I could sense it.
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
- Where are you from?
- Upstate.
That fellow you work with,
I don't like.
Not that I don't like him.
I just think he's silly.
I don't think he respects you.
I don't believe I've ever met anyone quite like you.
You wanna go to a movie with me?
- I have to go back to work.
- I don't mean now. Another time?
Sure. You know what you remind me of?
- What?
- That song.
By Kris Kristofferson.
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.
"He's a prophet--
He's a prophet and a pusher.
Partly truth, partly fiction.
A walking contradiction."
- You saying that about me?
- Who else would I be talking about?
I'm no pusher.
I never have pushed.
No, just the part about the contradictions. You are that.
I called Betsy again and she said... maybe we'd go to a movie after she gets off work tomorrow.
That's my day off.
At first she hesitated.
But I called her again and then she agreed.
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no, Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name again.
Damn! I gotta remember stuff like that.
I don't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves... until things start coming in from California.
This is just making me nervous.
We should have waited for the limo.
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going to California without preparation.
That's gonna get us in trouble.
Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Yes, I am.
I'm a big supporter. I tell everybody they have to vote for you.
Why, thank you...
Travis.
I'm sure you're gonna win.
Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.
I was gonna put one of your stickers in my taxi.
But the company said it was against their policy, but they don't know.
- They're jerks.
- Let me tell you.
I have learned more about America from riding in cabs... than in all the limos in the country.
- Yeah?
- That's true.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
What is the one thing about this country that bugs you the most?
I don't know. I don't follow political issues that closely.
There must be something.
Well, whatever it is, he should clean up this city here... because this city is like an open sewer, it's full of filth and scum.
Sometimes I can hardly take it.
Whoever becomes the president should just... really clean it up, know what I mean?
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.
It's like--
They never go away.
It's like the president should clean up this whole mess here.
He should flush it down the fucking toilet.
Well, I think I know what you mean, Travis.
But it's not gonna be easy.
- We have to make some radical changes.
- Damn straight.
- Here you go. Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.
You're a good man.
You're gonna win.
I thank you.
Come on, man.
Get me outta here, all right?
Come on !
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.
Don't make no scene.
You wanna get busted?
Bitch, be cool!
Don't start no trouble.
Cabbie, forget about this.
It's nothing.
Be cool.
Get your ass outta here!
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
- Did you have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.
Got a present for you.
Now back to Gene Krupa's syncopated style shortly.
Why'd you do that?
What else am I gonna do with my money?
I wish you would've listened to this.
I would've, except my record player doesn't work now.
Your stereo's broken? How can you stand it. I couldn't live without music.
I don't follow music too much.
But I would really like to.
You haven't heard this record yet.
But I was thinking, maybe we could listen to it on your record player.
Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.
- You've got to be kidding.
- Why?
This is a dirty movie.
No, this is a movie... a lot of couples come to, all kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I see them all the time.
Come on.
Excuse me!
Shut the fuck up.
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.
Why?
I don't know why I came in here.
I don't like these movies.
I didn't know you'd feel that way about these movies.
- I don't know much about movies--
- This the only kind you go to?
Yeah, I come--
This is not so bad.
Taking me to this place is about as exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."
There are other places, other movies I can take you.
- I don't know much about them.
- We're just different.
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.
- I've got to go now.
- Wait a second. I wanna talk to you.
Taxi !
Can't I talk to you at least?
Won't you talk to me? I didn't know--
- Won't you take the record?
- I've already got it.
But, please.
I bought it for you.
Thanks. Now I've got two.
Let's go.
Can I call you?
Jesus Christ!
I got a taxi !
Hello, Betsy.
Hi, it's Travis.
How you doin'? Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.
I didn't know that was the way you felt about it.
I didn't know that was the way you felt.
I would've taken you somewhere else.
Are you feeling better or--
Maybe you had a virus or something,
24-hour virus, you know.
It can happen. Yeah.
You been working hard, huh?
Would you like to have some dinner with me in the next few days?
How about a cup of coffee?
I could come by headquarters. We could--
Did you get my flowers in the--
You didn't get them?
I sent some flowers.
Yeah, well, okay, okay.
Can I call you again tomorrow or the next day?
Okay. No, I'm gonna--
Yeah, sure, okay. So long.
I tried several times to call her, but after the first call... she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.
I also sent flowers, but with no luck.
The smell of the flowers only made me sicker.
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.
I shouldn't complain, though.
You're only as healthy--
You're only as healthy as you feel.
You're only... as healthy... as... you... feel.
Hey, let's not have any trouble.
What? Why won't you talk to me, answer my calls when I call?
- You think I don't know you're here?
- Let's not have any trouble.
- Please leave.
- Get your hands off me.
Then leave. Let's not have any trouble.
This is no place to do this.
- Get your hands off me! Take 'em off!
- Okay, just leave! Come on.
You're in a hell, and you're gonna die in a hell like the rest of them!
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like the rest of them.
I'm calling the cop.
Officer!
Officer!
Don't come around here because I'll call the police!
I realize now how much she's just like the others.
Cold and distant.
And many people are like that.
Women for sure.
They're like a union.
Yo, cab!
Pull over to the curb.
Right over to the curb over there.
No, don't--
The fucking meter!
What are you doing?
What are you doing with the meter?
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?
Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.
I don't care what I have to pay.
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.
Put it down.
Put it-- That's right.
Put it down!
That's right.
Why are you writing?
Don't write!
Put the thing down.
Just sit.
I didn't tell you to write.
I said, "Pull over to the curb."
We're gonna sit here.
We're gonna sit.
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?
The light, the window up there on the second floor.
The one that's closest to the edge of the building.
The light up in the window, second story.
- Are you blind? Do you see the light?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you see it.
Good.
See the woman in the window?
Do you see the woman in the window?
Yeah.
You see the woman. Good.
I want you to see that woman
'cause that's my wife.
But that's not my apartment.
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?
You wouldn't know. I'm just saying,
"But you know who lives there?"
A nigger lives there.
How do you like that?
I'm gonna kill her.
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.
What do you think of that?
I said, what do you think of that?
Don't answer.
You don't have to answer everything.
I'm gonna kill her with a .44 Magnum pistol.
I have a .44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum would do to a woman's face?
It'll fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.
That's what it can do to her face.
Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy? That you should see.
You should see what a .44 Magnum's gonna do to a woman's pussy.
What's that?
I know you must think I'm, you know--
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?
Right? I bet you really think
I'm sick, right? You think I'm sick?
You think I'm sick?
You don't have to answer that.
I'm paying for the ride.
I picked up this midget.
He's very well dressed.
Italian suit. Good-looking.
Had a beautiful tall blonde.
A lady midget?
No, the guy was a midget.
The blonde was the lady.
- I got it.
- Those midgets are funny.
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?
They're funny. They always want to sit in the front seat.
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing, yelling.
The other says, "You bitch!"
Starts beating him on the head.
I say, "l don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home.
This is an American free country.
We've got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting.
You're adult.
But in my fucking cab, don't go busting heads.
You know? God loves you.
Do what you want."
Tell them to go to California.
In California, when two fags split up, one's gotta pay the other alimony.
Not bad. They're way ahead out there.
You know what I mean? California.
I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.
One time I saw a cop chasing this guy with one leg. He was on crutches.
The cop?
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.
You got that five you owe me?
The man is loaded.
I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me some people from Ohio at Kennedy.
I took them into Manhattan by way of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.
Where's the action around?
It's pretty slow.
I'm shoving on.
Wiz, wait.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Bye, Killer.
You can have all you want.
Don't be hittin' on me!
Don't be hittin'!
You better take your ass out, boy!
- Yeah?
- I know you and I ain't talked much.
But I figured you've been around a lot so you could--
Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."
I got-- It's just that I got--
- I got--
- Things got you down?
- Yeah.
- It happens to the best of us.
Yeah, it got me real down.
I just want to go out and really, really do something.
Taxi life, you mean?
Yeah, well--
No, it's--
I don't know.
I just wanna go out... and really--
I really wanna--
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just--
Look at it this way.
A man takes a job, you know?
And that job--
I mean, like that--
That becomes what he is.
You know, like--
You do a thing and that's what you are.
Like I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.
I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.
To be on the night shift drivin' somebody else's cab.
You understand?
I mean, you become--
You get a job, you become the job.
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.
You got a lawyer.
Another guy's a doctor.
Another guy dies.
Another guy gets well.
People are born.
I envy you your youth.
Go on, get laid, get drunk.
Do anything.
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.
More or less, ya know.
I don't know. That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.
It's not Bertrand Russell.
But what do you want? I'm a cabbie.
What do I know? I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
Maybe I don't know either.
Don't worry so much. Relax, Killer.
You're gonna be all right.
I know. I've seen a lot of people, and--
- I know. Okay?
- Yeah.
Thanks, man.
I guess--
Yeah, you know.
You're all right.
What do you think of your opponent's,
Goodwin's, chances in the primary?
Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.
I would, if it came to it, prefer him... to our opponent in the other party.
I think my programs are better defined than his.
They're more imaginative, and I have a better chance of winning.
I think it's academic, because he's not gonna win the primary. I am.
Well, one more thing I'd like to ask, and that's about your campaign.
How do you feel your campaign's going?
When we came up with our slogan,
"We are the people"... what I said,
"Let the people rule. "
I felt I was being somewhat overly optimistic.
I must fell you that I'm more optimistic now than ever before.
The people are rising to the demands that I have made on them.
The people are beginning to rule.
I feel it as the crowds swell.
I know if will continue through the primary, if will continue in Miami... and I know it will rise to an unprecedented swell in November.
Bitch, goddamn !
I'll blow her face off!
I'll kill her, goddamn it!
If I get my hands on her,
I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!
I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch !
I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!
Hey, Sport.
I'll kill her! Damn it!
- Taxi cab's following.
- Don't look at him.
Hey, guys.
What's happening?
You wanna take a walk?
Yeah.
Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere.
In bars, in cars... sidewalks, stores, everywhere.
There's no escape.
I'm God's lonely man.
June 8.
My life has taken another turn again.
The days move along with regularity, over and over.
One day indistinguishable from the next.
A long continuous chain.
Then suddenly, there is a change.
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.
How you doin', Travis?
- You got a .44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.
That's all right.
I got money.
It's a real monster.
It'll stop a car at 100 yards.
Put a round through the engine block.
Here you go.
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.
Look at that.
That's a beauty.
I could sell this gun to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.
But I just deal high quality goods to the right people.
How 'bout that?
This might be a little too big for practical purposes.
In which case for you,
I'd recommend a .38 snub-nose.
Look at this.
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.
It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.
Otherwise the same as a service revolver.
That'll stop anything that moves.
A Magnum, they use that in Africa for killing elephants.
That .38, that's a fine gun.
Some of these guns are like toys.
That .38, you go out and hammer nails with it all day... come back and it'll cut dead center on target every time.
It's got a really nice action to it and a heck of a wallop.
You interested in an automatic?
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.
It's a beautiful little gun.
Holds six shots in the clip, one shot in the chamber.
That's if you're dumb enough to put a round in the chamber.
Here, look at this.
A .380 Walther.
Holds eight shots in the clip.
That's a nice gun.
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.
During World War II, they used this gun to replace the P-38.
Just given out to officers.
Isn't that a little honey?
- How much for everything?
- All together.
Only a jackass would carry that cannon in the streets like that. Here.
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.
Forty dollars.
Three-fifty for the Magnum, two-fifty for the .38... one and a quarter for the .25, one-fifty for the .380.
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.
How 'bout dope?
Grass, hash, coke... mescaline, downers, Nembutal, toluol, chloral hydrates?
- How 'bout uppers, amphetamines?
- I'm not interested in that stuff.
I can get you crystal meth.
Nitrous oxide. How 'bout that?
I can get you a brand-new Cadillac with the pink slip for two grand.
June 29.
I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.
Too much abuse has gone on for too long.
From now on it'll be 50 pushups each morning.
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills, no more bad food... no more destroyers of my body.
From now on it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be fight.
Wow! Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, if looks so good.
It's getting harder and harder.
It's throbbing now.
The idea had been growing in my brain for some time.
True force.
All the king's men... cannot put if back together again.
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.
Go all the way back there to get--
- Come on.
- All right. It'll work.
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- It's not. I've done this 100 times.
- You've done this before?
- I've done this before. Don't worry.
- When was the last time you did this?
- I've never done this before.
What's the point of having something like this?
- Betsy?
- What?
Betsy, come here.
Come here.
Hi.
You're a secret service man, aren't you?
Huh?
Just waiting for the senator.
You're waiting for the senator?
That's a very good answer.
Shit, man!
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.
No. The reason I asked if you were a secret service man--
I won't say anything, because l--
I saw some suspicious-looking people over there.
- You did?
- They were right over there.
They were just here. I--
They were very, very, uh--
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.
Is it hard to get to be in the secret service?
Why?
I was just curious,
'cause I think I'd be good at it.
I'm very observant.
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.
I'm good with crowds.
I notice there's a little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?
- Sort of.
- Signal.
A secret signal for the secret service.
What kind of guns you guys carry?
.38s? .45s?
.357 Magnums?
Something bigger maybe?
Look, if you're really interested, if you give me your name and address... we'll send you the information on how to apply.
How's that?
- You will?
- Sure.
Why not?
My name is Henry Krinkle.
K-R-l-N-K-L-E.
154 Hopper Avenue.
- Hopper.
- Yeah.
You know, like a rabbit.
Hip, hop.
Fairlawn, New Jersey.
- Is there a zip code with that, Henry?
- Yeah. 610452.
That's six digits.
Well, 61045.
I was thinking of my telephone number.
Well, I've got it all. Henry, we'll get all the stuff out to you.
Thanks a lot. Great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.
You have to be careful livin' around a place like this.
Bye.
Faster than you, you fuckin' son of a--
I saw you comin', you fuckin' shit-heel.
I'm standin' here.
You make the move.
You make the move.
It's your move.
Don't try it, you fuck.
You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?
Then who the hell else are you talking--
You talking to me?
Well, I'm the only one here.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Oh, yeah?
Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.
Here is a man who would not take if anymore.
Who would not let--
Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.
Here is a man who would not take if anymore.
A man who stood up against the scum... the cunts, the dogs, the fifth, the shit.
Here is someone who stood up.
Here is--
You're dead.
Hey, Travis, EI Titere.
¿Que pasa?
Hi, Melio.
¿Que pasa?
Yeah, man?
Shut your fuckin' mouth and give me the cash out of the drawer.
Come on. Let's go.
Gimme the goddamn cash.
- Don't shoot. I'm gettin' it.
- Stop takin' so long. Come on !
Let me have it.
Gimme the bread.
This all you got? Reach in your sock and get the rest.
- I don't have any more money, man.
- Gimme the rest of the cash.
- That's all I got.
- You got more. Give me more.
- I ain't got no money!
- Reach in your sock. You got more.
- That's it, man.
- Gimme the rest of the fuckin' bread.
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.
Shit, man. Shit.
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.
I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Don't worry about it, man.
I'll take care of it.
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man. Just get out of here.
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.
That's the fifth motherfucker this year.
You wanna buy that dope?
Walt Whitman, that great American poet... spoke for all of us when he said...
"l am the man.
I suffered.
I was there. "
Today I say to you... we are the people.
We suffered.
We were there.
We the people suffered in Vietnam.
We the people suffered, we still suffer... from unemployment, inflation... crime and corruption.
Dear Father and Mother.
July is the month
I remember which brings... not only your wedding anniversary... but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday.
I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates... but I hope this card will take care of them all.
I'm sorry again
I cannot send you my address...
Like I promised to last year.
But the sensitive nature of my work for the government... demands utmost secrecy.
I know you will understand.
I am healthy and well, and making lots of money.
I have been going with a girl for several months... and I know you would be proud if you could see her.
Here name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that.
Cabbie, you can't park here.
Come on, let's go.
Move it.
No more will we the people... bear the burden of suffering for the few.
No more will we fight the wars of the few... to the harm of the many.
I hope this card finds you all well as if does me.
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.
One day there'll be a knock on the door, and it'll be me.
Love, Travis.
- Don't you have some idea?
- I'm not the one who wants to talk.
But you must know that the reason
I didn't marry him... is because I couldn't stand to be a cause of divorce.
Now, he's getting a divorce anyway, and--
Philip wants to marry me.
I do love him.
What about us, June?
Our marriage?
You've got to know that our marriage wasn't legal.
In the eyes of God we are married.
Brock, please don't do this to me.
I love him--
Damn!
Goddamn!
Are you trying to get rid of me?
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.
All right. You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.
I'll be over there waiting for you.
I went to Chinatown
To buy some egg too yung
Is your name Matthew?
I want some action.
Officer--
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.
You gonna bust me for nothin', man?
I'm not a cop.
I ain't no cop.
They why ask me for action?
Because she sent me over.
I suppose that ain't a .38 you got in your sock.
.38? No.
I'm clean, man.
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
It's all right. $15, 15 minutes,
$25, half an hour.
Ah, shit.
Cowboy, huh?
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.
Well, take it or leave it.
If you want to save yourself some money, don't fuck her...
'cause you'll be back every night for more.
She's 12 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.
You can do anything with her. You can come on her, fuck her in the mouth... fuck her in the ass, come on her face, man.
She'll get your cock so hard, she'll make it explode.
But no rough stuff.
All right?
All right, I'll take it.
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.
You wanna fuck me? You ain't gonna fuck me. You're gonna fuck her.
Give her the money.
Go ahead.
Catch you later, copper.
- What'd you say?
- See you later, copper.
I'm no cop.
If you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.
Buddy, you don't look hip.
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.
You're a funny guy.
But looks aren't everything.
Go ahead, have a good time.
You're a funny guy.
The room'll cost you ten bucks.
I'm timing you, too.
Come on.
Are you really 12 and a half?
Mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.
When that cigarette burns out, your time is up.
How old are you?
You don't want to tell me?
What's your name?
Easy.
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.
- But what's your real name?
- I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
What's wrong with that?
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?
Remember when you got into a taxi?
It was a Checker taxi.
You got in and that guy Matthew came by and said he wanted to take you away.
He pulled you away.
I don't remember.
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.
I'll get you out of here.
We better make it or Sport'll get mad.
How do you wanna make it?
I don't want to make it.
Who's Sport?
That's Matthew.
I call him Sport.
Want to make it like this?
Listen, l--
Can't you understand something?
You're the one who came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.
I must've been stoned.
What do you mean?
They drug you?
Come off it, man.
What are you doing?
Don't you want to make it?
No, I don't wanna make it.
I want to help you.
I can help you.
Damn, man !
Goddamn it!
Shit, man.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You don't have to make it.
Goddamn it!
Don't you want to get out of here?
Can't you understand why I came here?
I think I understand.
I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to take me away.
Is that it?
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
Then what about that one night?
I was stoned.
That's why they stopped me.
When I'm not stoned,
I got no place else to go.
So they just... protect me from myself.
No. I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay, I tried.
Look, I understand.
And it means something.
Really.
Look, can I see you again?
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.
All right.
How about breakfast tomorrow?
- Tomorrow when?
- I get up at about 1 :00.
Well, I got a thing--
Come on.
Do you want to or not?
Okay, all right.
Okay, 1 :00.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, Iris, my name is Travis.
Thanks a lot, Travis.
So long, Iris.
See you tomorrow.
Sweet Iris.
This is yours.
Spend it right.
Come back anytime, cowboy.
I will.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents?
I mean, they hate me. Why do you think
I split in the first place?
- There ain't nothin' there.
- But you can't live like this.
It's a hell.
A girl should live at home.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
What do you mean, women's lib?
You're a young girl.
You should be home now.
You should be dressed up, going out with boys, going to school.
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- God, are you square.
I'm not square. You're the one who's square. You're full of shit.
What are you talking about? You walk out with those fucking creeps...
Lowlifes and degenerates out on the street... and you sell your little pussy for nothing, man?
For some lowlife pimp who stands in a hole?
I'm square? You're the one that's square, man.
I don't screw and fuck with a bunch of killers and junkies the way you do.
You call that being hip?
What world you from?
- Who's a killer?
- Sport's a killer, that's who.
- Sport never killed nobody.
- He killed somebody.
- He's a Libra.
- He's a what?
I'm a Libra, too.
That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer to me.
I think that Cancers make the best lovers... but, God, my whole family are earth signs.
He's also a dope shooter.
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?
Didn't you ever try looking at your own eyeballs in the mirror?
So what are you gonna do about Sport and that old bastard?
- When?
- When you leave.
- I don't know. Just leave them.
- You're just gonna leave?
- They've got plenty of other girls.
- But you just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?
- Do you want me to call the cops?
- Cops don't do nothing. You know that.
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.
You can't allow him to do the same to other girls.
You can't allow him to do that.
He's the lowest kind of person in the world.
Somebody's got to do something to him.
He's the scum of the earth.
He's the worst... sucking scum I have ever seen.
You know what he told me about you?
He's calling you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.
He doesn't mean that.
I'm gonna go up to one of them communes in Vermont.
I never seen a commune before, but I don't know, you know?
I saw... some pictures once in a magazine, it didn't look very clean.
Why don't you come to the commune with me?
What, come to the commune with you?
Oh, no.
Why not?
I don't go to places like that.
- Why not?
- I don't get along with those people.
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?
That's it, you're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.
Besides, I gotta stay here.
- Come on. Why?
- I got something important to do.
What's so important?
Doing something for the government.
The cab thing is just part-time.
Are you a narc?
- Do I look like a narc?
- Yeah.
I am a narc.
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Tell you what.
I'll give you the money to go.
- No. You don't have to do that.
- No, I want you to take it.
I don't want you to take anything from them.
I want to do it.
I don't have anything better to do with my money.
I might be going away for a while.
Just a little test, that's all.
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.
Baby, I never wanted you to like what you're doing.
If you ever liked what you were doing, you wouldn't be my woman.
You never spend any time with me anymore.
I've got to attend to business, baby.
You miss your man, don't you?
I don't like to be away from you, either.
You know how I feel about you.
I depend on you.
I'd be lost without you.
Don't you ever forget that.
How much I need you.
Come to me, baby.
Let me hold you.
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.
I only wish every man could know what it's like to be loved by you.
That every woman everywhere... had a man that loves her like I love you.
God, it's good so close.
You know, at times like this...
I know I'm a lucky man.
Touching a woman who wants me and needs me.
Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together.
Now I see if clearly. My whole life is pointed in one direction.
I see that now.
There never has been any choice for me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States...
Senator Charles Palantine.
Thank you, Tom.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are met today at a crossroads:
Columbus Circle.
This is no ordinary place.
It is a place where many roads and many lives intersect.
It is appropriate that we meet here today... because these are not ordinary times.
We meet at a crossroads in history.
For far too long, the wrong roads have been taken.
The wrong roads have led us info war... into poverty, into unemployment... and inflation.
Today I say to you, we have reached the turning point.
No longer will we the people suffer for the few.
Now, I would lie to you if I told you the new roads would be easy.
They will not be easy.
Nothing that is right and good has ever been easy.
We the people know that!
And we the people know the right roads and the good.
Today I say to you, we are the people, you and l.
And it is time to let the people rule.
Thank you.
All right, men, pull back.
Watch your step.
- You've got my vote!
- Thank you. Thank you.
Over there.
Get that man.
Give us some air!
Give him some air, will you?
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run. I saw him run.
- What's happening?
- How you doin'?
Got the money?
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.
Hey, Sport, how you doing?
Okay, my man.
How are you?
- Where do I know you from?
- I don't know.
How's everything in the pimp business?
- Do I know you?
- No. Do I know you?
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.
Do I know you?
How's Iris?
You know Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.
Iris. Come on, get out of here, man.
You don't know anybody by the name of Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.
Get back to your fuckin' tribe before you get hurt.
Do me a favor.
I don't want no trouble. Okay?
You got a gun?
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get outta here!
Suck on this.
You crazy son of a bitch!
Fuckin' son of a bitch, you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you.
Crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you.
You fuckin' bastard!
I'll kill you.
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you !
Stop!
No! Don't shoot him!
Dear Mr. Bickle, I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were... to hear that you are well and recuperating.
We tried to visit you at the hospital... when we were in New York to pick up Iris.
But you were still in a coma.
There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us.
We thought we had lost her... and now our lives are full again.
Needless to say... you are something of a hero around this household.
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.
She's back in school and working hard.
The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine.
We have taken steps to see... she has never cause to run away again.
In conclusion,
Mrs. Steensma and l... would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again... to thank you in person, or we surely would.
But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh... you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home.
Our deepest thanks.
Burt and Ivy Steensma.
This guy Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up and says...
"l wanna swap tires."
I said, "These are new tires.
Why don't you throw in something else, like your wife?"
His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1957.
That's why the fleet has no spares.
Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
- Charlie T.
- What's happenin'?
Travis, you got a fare.
Ah, shit.
- See you later.
- See you, Travis.
Hello, Travis.
Hello.
I hear Palantine got the nomination.
Yeah. Won't be long now.
Seventeen days.
I hope he wins.
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?
It was nothing, really.
I got over that.
Papers always blow these things up.
Just a little stiffness, that's all.
Travis...
I'm--
How much was it?
So long.
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend
The end
Of our elaborate plans
The end
Of everything that stands
The end
No safety nor surprise
The end
I'll never look into your eyes
Again
Can you picture
What will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some
Stranger's hand
In a
Desperate land
Lost in a Roman
Wilderness of pain
And all the children
Are insane
All the children
Are insane
Waiting for the summer rain
Yeah
Saigon.
Shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.
When I was here,
I wanted to be there.
When I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle.
I'm here a week now.
Waiting for a mission...
getting softer.
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
And every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger.
Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah
Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah
Fuck, yeah, come on, baby
Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck
Oh, yeah, oh, fuck
Yeah, do it, yeah, come on
Yeah, all right
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Everyone gets everything he wants.
I wanted a mission...
and for my sins, they gave me one.
Brought it up to me like room service.
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?
Yeah, I'm comin'.
It was a real choice mission.
And when it was over,
I'd never want another.
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?
What does it look like?
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.
- What are the charges?
- Sir?
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.
- I see.
- All right?
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.
Come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.
Stand underneath this, Captain.
I was going to the worst place in the world...
and I didn't even know it yet.
Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...
that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable...
plugged straight into Kurtz.
It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker...
of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory-
any more than being back in Saigon was an accident.
There is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
If his story is really a confession-
- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- then so is mine.
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.
- Stand at ease.
- General.
You want a cigarette?
No, thank you, sir.
- Have you ever seen this man before?
- No, sir.
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.
Not personally.
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.
Your report specifies intelligence... counterintelligence with Com-Sec, "I" Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
Did you not work for the CIA in "I" Corps?
No, sir.
Did you not assassinate a government tax collector...
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?
Captain?
Sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation- nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation... if it did, in fact, exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk.
I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I notice that you have a bad hand there. You wounded?
I had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir.
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.
Well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad.
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.
To save a little time, we might pass both ways.
Captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp... but if you'll eat it... you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
I swear, why don't I just take a piece here?
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please?
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.
October 9, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, King.
These were monitored out of Cambodia.
This has been verified as Col. Kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail...
crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
That's my dream.
That's my nightmare.
Crawling, slithering...
along the edge...
of a straight razor...
and surviving.
Transmission 11, received
'68, December 30, 0500 hours.
Sector King, Zulu, King.
But we must kill them.
We must incinerate them.
Pig after pig.
Cow after cow.
Village after village.
Army after army.
And they call me an assassin.
What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
They lie. They lie, and we have to be merciful...
for those who lie.
Those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt Kurtz was one of the most outstanding officers... this country's ever produced.
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.
And he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man.
A man of wit and humor.
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that his... ideas, methods... became... unsound.
Unsound.
Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this...
Montagnard army of his that worship... the man like a god... and follow every order, however ridiculous.
Well, I have some other shocking news to tell you.
Col. Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?
Kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents- men he believed were double agents.
So he took matters into his own hands.
Well, you see, Willard... in this war, things get confused out there.
Power, ideals, the old morality... and practical military necessity.
But out there with these natives... it must be a temptation to... be God.
Because there's a conflict in every human heart... between the rational and the irrational... between good and evil... and good does not always triumph.
Sometimes... the dark side... overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
Every man has got a breaking point.
You and I have them.
Walt Kurtz has reached his.
And very obviously, he has gone insane.
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat- pick up Col. Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba... follow it, learn what you can along the way.
When you find the colonel, infiltrate his team by- whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command.
Terminate the colonel?
He's out there operating without any decent restraint... totally beyond the pale of any acceptable... human conduct... and he is still on the field, commanding troops.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
You understand, Captain, that this mission... does not exist nor will it ever exist.
How many people had I already killed?
There were those six that I knew about for sure-
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.
But this time it was an American...
and an officer.
That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...
but it did.
Shit. Charging a man with murder in this place...
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?
But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...
a type of plastic patrol boat- a pretty common sight on the rivers.
They said it was a good way to pick up information and move...
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.
I needed the air and the time.
Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone.
Mornin', Captain.
The crew were mostly just kids-
rock and rollers with one foot in their graves.
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.
The machinist- the one they called Chef- was from New Orleans.
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, on the forward fifties...
was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A.
To look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.
Clean- Mr. Clean- was from some South Bronx shit-hole...
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...
really put the zap on his head.
Then there was Phillips, the chief.
It might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief's boat.
There's about two points where we can draw enough water... to get into the Nung River.
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.
Don't worry about it.
Don't smoke.
You know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.
About six months ago...
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.
He was regular army too.
Heard he shot himself in the head.
At first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.
Third-generation West Point, top of his class.
Korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.
Et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hook in me...
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.
Like they said, he had an impressive career.
Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.
He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation-
general, chief of staff, anything.
In 1964, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...
and things started to slip.
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.
Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.
During the next few months, he made three requests for transfer...
to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.
Airborne?
He was 38 years old.
Why the fuck would he do that?
1966, joins Special Forces...
returns to Vietnam.
Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.
- What's up?
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?
- What's that?
- Arc light.
I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man.
There they are.
Concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
Smoke! Secondary burning.
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.
Let's have a look, Chief.
It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth-
That's them.
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.
But they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead.
Well, Air Mobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put.
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.
First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...
and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit.
They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.
What they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep- Go on. Keep going.
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.
Just go by like you're fighting, like you're fighting.
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.
Just go by. Keep on going.
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.
All right, come on. Go.
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.
Where can I find the CO?
That's the colonel comin' down!
The CO's on that chopper.
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 100 yards!
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!
Body cards!
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!
Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.
Captain Willard!
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you... on the requirements of my mission.
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
Sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung!
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!
But just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain.
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.
A two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds... six of clubs, eight of spades.
There isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.
Four of diamonds.
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!
- What?
- Death cards!
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!
This is an area that is controlled...
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Jim.
We are here to help you.
- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.
- to those who would like to return...
- Everybody in?
to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
Get in. Hurry up.
Move it out.
This is an area that is controlled...
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Hey! What's this?
What is this?
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
About the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
Yeah? What do you have to say?
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants water. He can drink paddy water.
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to-
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
He killed a lot of our people!
Any man brave enough to fight with his guts... strapped on him can drink from my canteen.
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.
Yeah? Here.
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have-
What's your name, sailor?
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class-
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.
It's an honor to meet you. I've admired your nose riding for years.
I like your cutback too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.
I want you to meet some guys.
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.
None of us are anywhere near your class though.
No way.
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.
Fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.
Been riding since you got here?
No way. I haven't surfed since I been here.
Through Christ, our Lord... from Whom all good things come... through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
All glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father.
Let us bring our iniquities to the Father... in the words our Savior gave us.
Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself.
They choppered in the T-bones and the beer...
and turned the LZ into a beach party.
The more they tried to make it just like home...
the more they made everybody miss it.
Make my meat rare- rare but not cold.
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.
He loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.
He was one of those guys that had that weird light around him.
You just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here.
What happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?
Airborne.
Sir, two places we can get into the river.
- Yeah.
- Here and here.
It's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.
That village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
What's the name of that goddamn village? Vin Drin-
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?
Damn gook names all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
That's a fantastic peak.
- Peak?
- About six foot.
It's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide... with a bowl section that's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.
Why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.
There aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.
It's all goddamn beach break.
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.
There's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.
We may not be able to get the boat in.
The draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
We'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it.
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.
Air mobile! I can take that point and hold it as long as I like.
You can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain.
Hell, a six-foot peak.
Take a gunship back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.
Bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six.
- I don't know, sir-
- What is it, soldier?
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look.
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!
All right, son, let 'er rip.
Let's go!
I never have got used to a light board. I can't get used to one.
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.
- Really?
- Yeah!
I thought all the young guys like lighter boards.
- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six.
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.
Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.
That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in.
Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun.
About a mile out, we'll put on the music.
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.
Hey, they're gonna play music!
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?
So we don't get our balls blown off.
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Fox Trot. Shall we dance?
Yes, sir!
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.
We got a couple- at that tree line.
We're taking fire from the holes.
Run, Charlie!
This should make everything burn.
We got a couple of people ahead here.
- What's going down here?
- We got an automatic! Shoot to kill!
- Shoot to kill in the open!
- I spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.
All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin' in.
What a shot.
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.
Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now.
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.
Well done, Hawks.
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines.
Ripple the shit out of 'em.
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.
Don't these people ever give up?
Nice shot, Bill.
- Shit!
- All right, all right!
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!
Get down!
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.
We just got a secondary down there in the plaza.
Hold on to your position.
Duke Six, we've got wounded down there.
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.
My God! Oh!
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?
I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 15 minutes.
I want my men out.
Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.
This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw 'em on and get out.
She's got a grenade!
She's got a grenade!
The whole thing blew up.
- She blew the shit-
- Fucking savages.
- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass.
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here.
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in.
My tail rotor's out.
I got control.
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.
Look! Good six-foot swells!
Come here, Lance.
Incoming!
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.
Come here! Come here!
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change.
It's still pretty hairy out there.
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.
That clear? Get going.
I'll cover for 'em.
And bring a board for Lance.
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.
- What?
- See how they break both ways?
One guy can break right, one left, simultaneous. What do you think?
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!
You wanna wait here for six hours?
Yo! Chief! Chief!
Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go!
- Dick-heads, take off!
- Goddamn it!
Don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
If I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach!
I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fuckin' place.
Give me that R-T, soldier.
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddamn it!
I want that tree line bombed!
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!
- Out!
- No, back, no!
Let me take care of this.
Get that out of here!
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.
They need some napalm in the tree line. Can you put it down there?
Right, One-Three. We're fixin' to fuck with 'em. What's the target?
We're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.
Put him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!
Tell my guys I want my board!
Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three.
The jets are inbound now. You got about 30 seconds to bomb station.
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.
Don't worry.
We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.
Give me those shorts.
These are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.
I want to see you do your stuff in 'em out there.
You smell that?
- Do you smell that?
- What?
Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that.
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know, one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours.
When it was all over,
I walked up.
We didn't find one of them, not one stinking dink body.
But the smell-
You know, that gasoline smell.
The whole hill smelled like... victory.
Someday this war's gonna end.
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?
- The wind!
- What?
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.
The kid's got a reputation.
You can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologize. It's not my fault.
The waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm.
Don't get me wrong-
It was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
But if you could hang around 20 minutes-
- Some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.
Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right.
Look, Lance.
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yeah!
- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm.
Just wait 20 minutes!
Damn! Fuck!
They've been lookin' for ya.
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?
Here!
Incoming!
That's the colonel's surfboard!
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!
You fucking Airborne!
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.
Come on. Let's get high.
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.
Someday this war's gonna end.
That would be just fine with the boys on the boat.
They weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there...
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
Buddha time. Here.
All right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.
If that's how Kilgore fought the war...
I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.
It wasn't just insanity and murder.
There was enough of that to go around for everyone.
I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy.
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
You know, kind of spread it around on us.
She's into mangos too.
She's like one limb above me.
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.
That guy's too fuckin' much, man.
Do you think he would have shot us?
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach... but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how
Let's get this board out of my turret.
Sucker.
How am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
Sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
He's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
We'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.
What makes you say that?
You think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver... to know we stole his board?
I didn't steal it!
- Captain?
- Hmm?
Just how far up this river we goin'?
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.
We're goin' up pretty far.
Is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
You like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?
Fuck.
Maybe you'll get a chance to know... what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take-
I'll go with him.
Chef?
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
Then, I was supposed to go to Paris... study at the Escoffier school.
But then I got orders for my physical.
Hell, I joined the navy.
Heard they had better food.
Cook school- that did it.
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.
They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
All of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it.
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.
Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons- all of it- boiling it!
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
That's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me-
What is it?
Charlie?
It's a tiger!
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.
- Get on your 60!
- Got it.
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!
Let's go!
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!
Never get out of the boat!
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!
- What?
- A tiger?
Yes! I've had it! I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!
You can kiss my ass on the county square... because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.
I didn't come here for this.
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.
I didn't get out the goddamn eighth grade for this kind of shit!
All I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.
All right?
It's gonna be all right?
Never get out of the fuckin' boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Good-bye!
Never get out of the boat.
Absolutely, goddamn right...
unless you were going all the way.
Kurtz got off the boat.
He split from the whole fuckin' program.
How did that happen?
What did he see here that first tour?
Thirty-eight fucking years old.
If you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.
The more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
His family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
He had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
But when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
The next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
They must have thought he was some far-out old man...
humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me.
A tough motherfucker.
He finished it.
He could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
Dear Eva...
Today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.
Really un-fucking believable, you know?
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river... but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
Come on, baby
Thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
October 1967.
On special assignment...
Kontoom Province, II Corps.
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
Rated a major success.
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.
What balls.
They were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.
But after the press got a hold of it...
they promoted him to full colonel instead.
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.
You needed wings to stay above it.
This sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
Expecting us this time?
Damned if I know.
Hello. Hello.
Jesus-
Wow.
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?
We gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
Check out the bikes, Lance.
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man.
This is something.
- Please!
- This must be the guy.
Right over there.
Sergeant. Sergeant.
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five-
Come on, man! Move!
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
- Sergeant?
- Destination?
I don't have no destination.
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence.
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night.
Eight bucks for that-
Hey!
All right. Damn.
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.
Just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
Would you guys like some seats- some press box seats for the show?
The show out here.
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?
You got it.
You gonna be here?
Hey, listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?
How ya doin' out there?
I said, how ya doin' out there?
Wanna say hello to you from all of us up here...
to all of you out there who work...
so goddamn hard in Operation Brute Force!
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!
And the marines!
And the sailors!
We wanna let you know that we're proud of you!
We know how tough and how hard it's been.
To prove it we're gonna give you entertainment you're gonna like.
Miss August,
Miss Sandra Beatty.
Miss May,
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!
And the playmate of the year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!
Yo! Whoa!
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
- Oh, Susie-Q, baby, I love you
- Hello!
Susie-Q
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Baby, I love you
Susie-Q
I love you!
- Come on!
- What's the matter?
Come on, baby!
Grease my gun!
I'm ready to powwow, baby!
Come on! All right!
You're cute. I like you.
I'm here, baby! I'm here!
Yeah!
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!
Take it off!
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!
Sign my centerfold!
Come on, baby!
Goddamn!
Start her up. Hey!
Get out of my way!
Come on!
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!
Hurry!
So long!
Charlie didn't get much USO.
He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.
His idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat.
He had only two ways home-
death or victory.
No wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.
The war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...
who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.
You can really get hung up on these broads, man... just like that cat in the delta.
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.
Remember? This cat, man-
He really dug his Playboy, man.
Dig it.
When the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man.
Look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was workin' ARVN patrols.
One of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit-
One day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back.
He said, "Give me my magazine back."
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!
- Then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef. Take the wheel.
This dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
Take the wheel.
He started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold.
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.
You leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.
Don't do her like that."
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.
The sergeant couldn't handle it no more.
He just picked up his iron... flipped it to rock and roll and-
Boom!
Gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
It blew his ass clean off of the dock.
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day. That was it for his ass.
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.
It's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothin'.
Fuckin' ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.
Should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
Bummer for the gook though, ain't it?
Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist
Zack Johnson on AMVN.
It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.
We have an important message for all GI's...
who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon.
He'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors...
instead of on the windowsills.
The mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.
Now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam...
who's all alone out there with the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry...
and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO.
- The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."
- All right!
Watch out, Clean!
Get down, bubba!
I can't get no
Satisfaction
Hang on, Lance!
I can't get no
Satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try
- Get down, bubba!
- And I try and I try
I can't get no
I can't get no
Yeah!
When I'm drivin' in my car
- And the man comes on the radio
- Tell 'em you did it, Lance.
He's tellin' me more and more
- I see you is right on target.
- About useless information
- Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!
Look out, Lance!
That's what I say
"Commitment and
Counterinsurgency...
by Col. Walter E. Kurtz.
As long as our officers and troops perform...
tours of duty limited to one year...
they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam.
As long as cold beer, hot food, rock and roll...
and all the other amenities remain the expected norm...
our conduct of the war will gain only impotence.
We need fewer men, and better.
If they were committed, this war could be won...
with a fourth of our present force."
Shit. Chicken time.
You ain't shittin', bro.
They're motherfuckin'.
Who is that?
Is that you, Lazzaro?
Don't chicken out.
Lazzaro!
Come on!
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! Get outta there!
Yeah! I got it!
I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!
Put that fucker out, man!
What the fuck they think they're doin'?
Late summer, autumn 1968.
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush.
The camp started falling apart.
November.
Kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman.
Two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army.
Enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.
Guess he must have hit the right four people.
He joined the Special Forces.
After that his-
The army tried one last time to bring him back into the fold.
- methods-
- If he'd pulled over...
- it all would have been forgotten.
- unsound.
But he kept going.
- Now he's crossed into Cambodia-
- He kept winning it his way.
- with this Montagnard army of his-
- And they called me in.
Man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
They lost him.
He was gone.
Nothing but rumors and random intelligence...
mostly from captured VC.
The VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him.
He and his men were playing hit-and-run...
all the way into Cambodia.
I know what I'm doin'.
I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner... with the president of the United States.
That's where I'm goin'.
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.
Clean.
How long has that kid been on this boat?
Seven months.
He's really specializing in busting my balls.
Very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you.
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.
My orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat... so I don't!
But one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
You just get me close to my destination... and I'll cut you and the crew loose.
All right, Captain.
"Dear Son...
I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have been worried...
at not hearing from me during the past weeks...
but my situation here has become a difficult one.
I have been officially accused of murder by the army.
The alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents.
We spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence.
When absolute proof was completed, we acted- we acted like soldiers.
The charges are unjustified.
They are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict...
quite completely insane.
In a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action.
There are many moments for ruthless action-
what is often called ruthless...
but may in many circumstances be only clarity-
seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it-"
- Medevac, come in.
- "directly-
- quickly, awake."
- Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha.
- "Looking at it."
- Request dust-off.
Three, maybe four KIA's. Over.
"I trust you to tell your mother what you choose about this letter.
As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned."
Medevac, come in.
"I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring."
Medevac, do you read? Over.
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."
Jesus.
No wonder I couldn't get 'em on the radio.
What a dump.
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got there.
Never seen one up here before.
We called in a request for Medevac. You receive it?
Medevac? No.
We passed a downed Huey with some KIA's.
- On your way here?
- Yeah.
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?
We want to send some people downriver.
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?
Why don't you see what you can do with that engine?
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.
Hey, don't leave without me.
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
Don't ask me, man.
Give my clothes back, you asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, guys, where's the CO?
He stepped on a land mine about two months ago. He got blown to hell.
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.
What about you, fella?
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam. You mark my words.
- Keep it in that condition-
- Get off my back!
- No, man, I'm telling you-
- Lay off!
Hey! Hey! Come here!
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.
What do you want?
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!
Get out of the rain.
Get off me!
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.
Chef, your ass is shit!
You're a motherfucker, man.
Goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker!
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.
Hey, guys.
I got you!
I got your ass!
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.
- You pulled my fuckin'-
- Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.
Come on!
Captain.
You're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month?
Nope, playmate of the year, Chief.
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!
Captain, we get in a fire fight and run out of fuel...
I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.
You know, I got a-
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the playmate's review... the playmate of the year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.
You are-
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.
Is it coming?
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.
He's not one of my regular birds.
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.
Being playmate of the year... is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.
It's like-
You try to express... your feelings to someone and show them your heart-
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
But would you mind just puttin' this-
Would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
And there's this glass wall between you- this invisible glass.
They can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years-
- That's beautiful.
- at Busch Gardens.
This was cascading over your right shoulder. This was open here.
But they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle-
Your right hand was-
Hey, Chef!
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.
You can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.
Your ass was sticking out just a little- Hey, man, fuck off!
Fifteen minutes!
That's why I tried so desperately... to show somebody that I had some talent.
Little baby macaws.
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.
- They're all blue-
- Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
They make you do things you don't wanna do- like, this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
You were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.
- I love training birds.
- That's it.
That's it. That's very-
That's it. Voila.
You're beautiful.
I just want to-
You know, I can't believe it.
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship... with a beautiful, innocent boy.
Just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War...
I never would have met you,
Miss December.
Miss May.
I wish-
I wish I could find... just one person... that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!
Who is that?
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!
You finished yet?
Oh! Fuck!
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!
It drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do... that I didn't want to do.
They said, "Pull the ribbons between your legs."
I didn't want to do it.
But they said that was what was expected of me... that that's what people wanted to see.
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuckup.
Sorry about that. If I'd have known, I'd take you to New Orleans.
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to-
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.
You're a fuckin' dog!
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.
Lay off, Chef.
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.
Lay off!
What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?
Chef, I said lay off!
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break! What do you think I said?
Then give your jaws a rest!
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!
So get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt... and stop smoking that dope!
You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
- Camouflage.
- How's that?
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.
Let's take a look. Lance.
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.
Clean, get on that 60!
What's up, Chief?
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.
Well, let's forget routine now and let 'em go.
These boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain.
I'm gonna take a look.
My mission's got priority.
You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!
Can couc, you too.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.
It's clear, Chief.
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.
Just some baskets and some ducks, fuckin' bananas.
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables-
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!
- Get on it!
- All right!
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!
Come on!
Check that vegetable basket!
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?
Chef!
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.
Why the fuck not?
- Clean?
- I'm good.
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?
It's a fuckin' puppy.
It's a fuckin' puppy.
Give me that dog!
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!
- Chef-
- You want that?
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddamn it!
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.
The book says-
Fuck you. Fuck 'im.
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.
It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.
We'd cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.
It was a lie.
And the more I saw of them...
the more I hated lies.
Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again...
but I felt like I knew one or two things about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier.
Do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.
Beyond it, there was only Kurtz.
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
Huh? What's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving?
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?
Far out.
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!
Take me home!
Goddamn it!
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?
Don't keep goin'!
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!
Fuck you!
You'll get what you deserve!
Is there a Captain Willard on board?
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.
Get that light off me!
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these three days ago, sir.
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?
Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way.
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain.
Captain, where you going?
See if I can find some fuel and get some information.
Pick me up at the other side of the bridge.
Somebody go with him. Chef.
I'll go.
I wanna go.
Man, listen to the music, man.
Where can I find the CO?
You came right to it, son of a bitch!
Get down here!
You still got a commanding officer here?
- Beverly Hills.
- What?
Straight up the road, there's a concrete fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!
Where the fuck else do you think it would be?
- Goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.
Well, you thought wrong, damn it!
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?
You think you're so bad, huh, nigger?
What are you shooting at, soldier?
What the fuck ya think I'm shootin' at?
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks out there by the wire.
But I think I killed them all.
You ain't shot shit. Listen.
Oh, shit. He's trying to call his friends. Send up a flare.
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?
They're all dead, stupid.
There's one still alive underneath them bodies.
Who's the commanding officer here?
Ain't you?
You think you so bad?
I got something for your ass now, nigger! I got something for you now!
He's underneath the bodies, man.
Go get the Roach for me.
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.
Roach. Roach.
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?
Do you hear 'em?
Fuck you, GI!
We'll bust 'em!
Hey, GI, fuck you!
Fuck you, GI!
Fuck you, GI!
Hear him out there on the wire, man?
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?
He's close, man.
He's real close.
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!
Fuck you, GI!
GI, fuck you!
GI! GI-
Motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.
Do you know who's in command here?
Holy shit.
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge.
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.
There's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.
Let's move out.
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.
Let's just get goin'.
Which way, Captain?
You know which way, Chief.
You're on your own, Captain.
Still wanna go on?
It's like this bridge.
We build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again... just so the generals can say the road's open.
Think about it.
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!
Chef, on the bow.
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!
You got one, Miller.
Geez, I got some too.
Whose package is that?
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.
- Is that it?
- That's it for you. Lance.
Mr. L. B. Johnson, there you go.
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."
Man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.
"I remember the time we went up to-"
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.
"There could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?
Let me know."
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.
"There has been a new development regarding your mission...
which we must now communicate to you.
Months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours.
We have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. Kurtz.
Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake...
but they assumed he was dead.
Then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife."
Captain Richard Colby.
He was with Kurtz.
Disneyland.
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
"Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home... anyway as a symbol of protest."
That's really weird, ain't it?
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.
She pictures me at home having a beer watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man.
Oh, hot potato, hot potato.
I'm so glad you decided to join the navy.
Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know.
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away... trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
That's much more than I can say for some of your friends.
If this tape is any good...
I will have Dad and the family send you a tape of their own.
Fuckers!
There! Over there!
Motherfuckers!
There. Over there!
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.
Where'd the dog go?
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.
Hey, Clean. Hey.
Hey, bubba.
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!
Hey, bubba.
And so I'm hoping that- pretty soon- not too soon-
but pretty soon I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil.
And then when your wife get 'em back, she'll be mad with me.
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama...
will come to celebrate your coming home.
Granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car...
but don't tell 'em because that's our secret.
Anyhow, do the right thing...
stay out of the way of the bullets...
and bring your heinie home all in one piece...
because we love you very much.
Love, Mom.
Hold on.
Throw me the glasses.
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.
Fuck me.
Cover the captain. Lance.
Cover the captain.
They're French.
They're French.
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Stand fast. Captain.
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.
We lost one of our men.
We French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.
You're all welcome.
My name is Hubert DeMarais.
This is my family's plantation.
It has been such for 70 years.
And it will be such until we are all dead.
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller... on behalf of a grateful nation.
This food is really wonderful, isn't it? The wine, the sauces.
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?
The chef speak only Vietnamese.
No kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.
But they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel.
As you can see.
Attack repels by the family.
Just for this war.
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.
South Vietnamese, 11.
Americans, six?
Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes.
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.
Madame Sarrault.
Captain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story... about Paris and people starving during the war.
They are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say...
"An angel is passing by."
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."
Oh.
How long can you possibly stay here?
We stay forever.
No, no. I mean... why don't you go back home to France?
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.
Sooner or later, you're-
You don't understand our mentality- the French officer mentality!
At first, we lose in Second World War.
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa-
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.
In Indochina, we lose!
But here we don't lose!
This piece of earth, we keep it.
We will never lose it.
Never!
You Americans.
In 1945, yeah... after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt... didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.
So... you Americans implant the Vietminh.
What's he mean?
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong were invented by the Americans.
The Americans?
And now you take the French place... and the Vietminh fight you.
And what can you do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.
We are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers."
They hate the Chinese!
Maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese.
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists... they will be Vietnamese Communists.
And this is something that you never understood, you American.
I don't know.
Maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.
Don't you understand?
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."
That's finish for all the white people in Indochina.
If you're French, American, that's all the same.
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.
The white left... but the yellow stays!
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.
Tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines... then maybe Europe."
Come on. Why not Europe?
Look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.
Even before Second World War Americans knew exactly what was going on.
They don't want that shit to take over! LeFevre!
All you white people are shit.
They are fighting- fighting for freedom.
Freedom? Bullshit.
French bullshit.
American bullshit.
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.
All soldiers know they are already dead.
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.
A military mistake.
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!
Voluntary!
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.
The generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets... to get the cannon up there in the mountains.
But they do. Then they wait for the rain to come.
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know,
90 meters- 70 meters.
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.
And they only do that to be dead with their friends.
The French Army was sacrificed.
Sacrificed by the politicians safe at home.
They put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win.
The students are marching in Paris... protesting, demonstrating.
They stab the soldiers in their back.
The soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work.
A piece of paper would fall-
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.
Dien Bien Phu, okay.
The French is shit, huh?
No one care.
No one want-
Why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?
Mon Dieux, with your army, your strength... your power, you could win if you want to!
You can win.
You know, I'm sure we can make something here.
I'm sure about it, you know?
I never do something wrong to the people here.
That's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors.
- Communist!
- Socialist!
Capitaine, good night.
He was a Socialist, you know.
We can stay. I know that we can stay. We can.
You know, we always helped the people.
We work with the people.
So we can be friends, we are agreed.
See, Captain, when my grandfather... and my uncle's father came here... there was nothing- nothing.
The Vietnamese were nothing.
So we worked hard... very hard, and brought... the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.
We took the Vietnamese, work with them... make something- something out of nothing.
So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain... we want to stay here because it's ours- it belongs to us.
It keeps our family together.
I mean, we fight for that.
While you Americans, you are fighting for... the biggest nothing in history.
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see if your men need any help to... repair your boat... so that you can go on with your war.
I apologize for my family, Captain.
We have all lost much here.
Hubert- his wife and two sons.
And I have lost a husband.
I understand.
You are tired of the war.
I can see it in your face.
'Twas the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.
We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus-"
The Lost Soldiers.
If you like, we can have some cognac.
I have to- to see about my men and-
The war will be still here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
No, I don't drink wine.
I do like cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you.
Well... then I-
I must drink alone.
Will you go back after the war to America?
Then you're like us- your home is here.
Do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.
'Twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
He would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.
Don't you see?
One that kills and one that loves."
And he said to me...
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."
But you are both.
You want more?
All that matters is that you're alive.
You are alive, Captain.
That's the truth.
There are two of you, don't you see?
One that kills... and one that loves.
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.
You're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't riskin' no more lives.
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.
You see anything, Chef?
Why don't they fucking attack, man?
Watch it over here, Chief.
Got a stump.
On the fifties.
He was close.
He was real close.
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...
and the water was flowing back into the jungle.
Whatever was going to happen...
it wasn't going to be the way they called it back in Nha Trang.
- Arrows!
- Fire!
Chef, open up! Fire!
Lance, fire!
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.
Quiet!
You got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out... because you don't know where the hell you're going, do ya?
Do ya?
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
Lance, get the wheel!
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!
A spear?
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.
There's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane... and I'm supposed to kill him.
That's fucking typical!
Shit!
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!
I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys?
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge... or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'.
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?
Part of me was afraid of what I would find...
and what I would do when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
But the thing
I felt the most...
much stronger than fear...
was the desire to confront him.
Just keep movin'.
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.
There's mines over there and mines over there too.
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.
I'm an American.
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.
Hi. American.
American civilian.
It's all right.
And you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.
Who are all these people?
Yeah, well, they think you've come to- to take him away.
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?
Him! Col. Kurtz.
These are all his children, man, as far as you can see.
Hell, man, out here we're all his children.
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.
Well, you listen to him.
The man's enlarged my mind.
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes he'll-
Well, you say hello to him, right?
He'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you."
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws... scuttling across floors of silent seas."
- I mean-
- Stay with the boat.
Don't go any- Don't go without me, okay? I wanna get a picture.
He can be terrible and he can be mean... and he can be right.
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.
I mean-
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?
Because I took his picture.
He said, "If you take my picture again...
I'm gonna kill you."
And he meant it.
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.
Lay back. Dig it.
He gets friendly again.
He really does.
But you don't- you don't- you don't judge the colonel.
You don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!
You can feel the vibe of this place.
Let me take your picture. Hey, could you hold- Hey, hello. Hello.
Could you hold up a minute?
Colby.
The heads.
You're looking at the heads.
I, uh- Sometimes he goes too far.
He's the first one to admit it.
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!
If you could have heard the man just two days ago- if you could have heard him then, God-
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!
I just wanna talk to him.
Well, man, he's gone away.
He's gone away. He disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
- I think you should-
- Okay, Chef.
We'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah, stay with Lance.
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do anything to get out of this joint.
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.
They're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.
I ain't afraid of all them fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.
I used to think if I died in an evil place... then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.
But now, fuck-
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out.
See if I can find the colonel, okay?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Here. You take the radio... and if I don't get back by 2200 hours... you call in the air strike.
"Air strike?"
The code is "Almighty"... coordinates zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two.
It's all in there.
Zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two.
Everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane.
The place was full of bodies-
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.
If I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
It smelled like slow death in there-
malaria...
and nightmares.
This was the end of the river, all right.
Where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes, sir.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you from the river?
The Ohio River, sir?
About 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.
There's a place in the river-
I can't remember-
Must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about- for about five miles you'd think that... heaven just fell on the earth... in the form of gardenias.
Have you ever considered... any real freedoms?
Freedoms from the opinion of others?
Even the opinions of yourself?
Did they say why, Willard?
Why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.
It's no longer classified, is it?
What did they tell you?
They told me... that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods... were unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method... at all, sir.
I expected... someone like you.
What did you expect?
Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither.
You're an errand boy... sent by grocery clerks... to collect the bill.
Why, huh?
Why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?
Feeling pretty good, huh?
Why?
Do you know-
Do you know that the man- the man really likes you?
He likes you.
He really likes you.
But he's got something in mind for you.
Aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?
There's something happening out here, man.
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.
That's right, Jack.
The man is clear in his mind... but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this.
He hates it.
But the man's-
He reads poetry out loud, all right?
And a voice- a voice-
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.
What are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say? He was a kind man?
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?
Bullshit, man!
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!
You.
Almost eight hours.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.
Fuck.
Has it been eight hours?
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.
This is PBR Street Gang.
Radio check. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ!
Time magazine.
The weekly newsmagazine.
September 22, 1967.
Volume 90... number 12.
"The War on the Horizon. The American people may find it hard to believe... that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.
Nevertheless... one of the most exhaustive inquiries... into the status of the conflict yet compiled... offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power... two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began... is beginning to make itself felt.
White House officials maintain the impact of that strength... may bring the enemy to the point where he could... simply be unable to continue fighting."
Is this familiar?
"Because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public... is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions... he may never permit the report to be released in full.
Even so, he is sufficiently impressed with the findings... and sufficiently anxious to make their conclusions known... to permit experts who have been working on it... to talk about it in general terms."
No date, Time magazine.
"Sir Robert Thompson... who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya... is now a RAND corporation consultant... recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.
He told the president last week... that things felt much better... and smelled much better over there."
How do they smell to you, soldier?
You'll be free.
You'll be under guard.
Read these at your leisure.
Don't lose them.
Don't try to escape.
You'll be shot.
We can talk of these things later.
"We are the hollow men.
We are the stuffed men... leaning together at peace filled with straw.
Alas, our dried voices when we whisper together... are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass... or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.
He's really out there.
Shape without form... shade without color... paralyzed force... gesture without motion."
Do you know what the man's saying? Do you?
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.
You can't travel in space. You can't go out into space, you know... without like, you know, with fractions.
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?
What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?
That's dialectic physics, okay.
Dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.
You either love somebody or you hate 'em.
Mutt!
You mutt.
This is the way the fucking world is.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!
Not with a bang.
A whimper.
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
On the river, I thought that the minute I looked at him...
I'd know what to do.
But it didn't happen.
I was in there with him for days. Not under guard.
I was free.
But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.
He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.
If the generals back in Nha Trang could see what I saw...
would they still want me to kill him?
More than ever, probably.
And what would his people back home want if they ever learned...
just how far from them he'd really gone?
He broke from them...
and then he broke from himself.
I'd never seen a man so broken up and...
ripped apart.
I've seen the horrors- horrors that you've seen.
But you have no right to call me a murderer.
You have a right to kill me.
You have a right to do that.
But you have no right to judge me.
It's impossible for words... to describe... what is necessary... to those... who do not know... what horror means.
Horror.
Horror has a face.
And you must make a friend of horror.
Horror and moral terror... are your friends.
If they are not... then they are enemies to be feared.
They are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.
Seems a thousand centuries ago.
We went into a camp to inoculate... some children.
We'd left the camp... after we had inoculated the children for polio.
And this old man came running after us, and he was crying.
He couldn't say.
We went back there... and they had come and hacked off... every inoculated arm.
There they were, in a pile- a pile of... little arms.
And I remember...
I- I- I cried.
I wept like... some grandmother.
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
And then I realized... like I was shot- like I was shot with a diamond- a diamond bullet right through my forehead.
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.
The genius."
The will to do that.
Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
And then I realized... they were stronger than me because they could stand it.
These were not monsters.
These were men- trained cadres.
These men who fought with their hearts... who have families, who have children... who are filled with love... that they had the strength- the strength... to do that.
If I had ten divisions of those men... then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
You have to have men... who are moral... and at the same time... who are able to... utilize their... primordial instincts to kill... without feeling, without passion... without judgment- without judgment.
Because it's judgment that defeats us.
I worry that my son... might not understand what I've tried to be.
And if I were to be killed, Willard...
I would want someone to go to my home... and tell my son everything.
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.
Because there's nothing that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
And if you understand me,
Willard, you-
you will do this for me.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by. How do you copy?
They were gonna make me a major for this...
and I wasn't even in their fuckin' army anymore.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
Him most of all.
I felt like he was up there...
waiting for me to take the pain away.
He just wanted to go out like a soldier...
standing up.
Not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.
Even the jungle wanted him dead.
And that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
Come on, baby take a chance with us
Come on, baby take a chance with us
Come on, baby take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus tonight
Blue bus tonight
Blue bus tonight
Blue
Come on, yeah
We train young men to drop fire on people... but their commanders... won't allow them to write "fuck"... on their airplanes because... it's obscene.
The horror.
The horror.
Calling PBR Street Gang.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.
PBR Street Gang?
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty-
The horror.
The horror.
You wanted to see me, doctor?
Have you seen Mrs. Vogler, sister?
No, not yet.
Then I will let you know about the situation and will explain to you why you must take care of her.
As you may know,
Mrs. Vogler is an actress, and was cast as Electra.
In the middle of the play she went silent and looked around as if surprised.
She stayed silent for a minute.
Later she excused herself saying that she could not contain her laughter.
The next day the theater called to ask if she had forgotten the rehearsal.
When the housekeeper went to see her, she was still in bed.
She was awake, but did not respond to her questions and did not move.
She's been like that for three months and they have done all tests imaginable.
The result is clear: she is totally sane, physically as well as mentally.
This is not even about a hysterical reaction.
Any questions,
Sister Alma?
No?
Well then, go with Mrs. Vogler.
Good day, Mrs. Vogler.
I am Sister Alma.
They have put me in charge of taking care of you for some time.
Maybe I should tell you about myself.
I am 25 years old and engaged.
I have been a nurse for two years now.
My parents have a farm.
My mother was a nurse before marrying.
I will go for the dinner plate.
Fried liver and a fruit salad.
This looks very good.
Would you like to raise your head?
Are you fine like this?
Sister Alma.
What is your first impression?
I don't know what to say, doctor.
At first her face seemed sweet, almost infantile.
Then her eyes...
She has such a severe stare...
I don't know, maybe I should...
What are you thinking Sister Alma?
Maybe I should turn down this job.
Has something scared you?
No, but... she should have an older and more experienced nurse.
Experienced in life.
It could be that I may not be able.
To handle it. To resist?
Mentally.
Mentally?
If the state of Mrs. Vogler is the result of a decision, it should be strong like when she was well.
And?
It is a decision that shows great mental strength.
Maybe I am not up to it.
Maybe you would like to see the dusk,
Mrs. Vogler.
I will close it later.
Would you like me to turn on the radio?
There is a radio soap, I think.
Excuse me, my dear.
Oh! You must forgive me!
There is nothing else I desire other than your forgiveness.
What are you laughing at, Mrs. Vogler?
Is the actress,that one that's funny ?
What do you know about compasion?
What do you know?
What do you know about compasion?
I don't understand those sort of things, Mrs. Vogler.
I like cinema and theatre, but I hardly go.
I feel a great admiration for artists.
I think art has a great importance in life.
Especially for those that have serious problems.
I should talk about those things.
I'm skating on ice.
Let me see if I can find music.
Is it alright like this?
Good night, Mrs. Vogler.
Sleep well.
Damn it!
It's strange.
One goes through life doing the same things.
Doing the same things.
I will marry Karl-Henrik and will have some children... that I will raise.
All of this is decided.
It is inside me.
There is nothing to think.
It is an enormous feeling of security.
I have a good job and I am happy with him.
That is also good, but on the other hand.
But it is good...
It's good.
I ask myself what will really happen?
Elisabeth Vogler...
Elisabeth...
.... today, between the American artillery and the South Vietnamese and the desperate guerrilla of
Vietcong that attacked the vital coastal base.
Marine planes and the American airfoce in Quang are bombing positions of the
Vietcong army in Tay Ninh.
Today planes have left on more than 48 bombing missions.
And in other fronts, various American troop batalions, landed yesterday in the coast near...
In this zone more than 2.000 vietcongs were captured in the largest operation in the last three months.
Today the street disturbances...
.... that have sent more than 141 Vietcongs to the tribunals...
Would you like me to open the letter, Mrs. Vogler?
Should I read it?
Would you like me to read it?
"Dear Elisabeth: Since they don't permit me to see you, I am writing you.
If you do not want to read my letter, then you can ignore it.
I can not stop looking for contact with you, since I am tormented constantly by one question:
Have I hurt you in any way?
Have I hurt you without knowing?
Is there a terrible misunderstanding between us?"
Do you think I should keep reading this?
"Lately we were happy; as far I thought.
We'd had never been so close to each other.
Do you remember when you'd say:
"Now I understand marriage"?
You have shown me..."
I do not understand...
Yes. "... that we should see each other like two anxious children,
Full of good will and the best intentions, but gov...
But govern by forces that we only parcially control.
Do you remember saying all this?
We walked through the woods and you stopped me holding from my belt..."
There is also a picture with the letter.
It is a picture of your son...
I don't know if...
Would you like to see it, Mrs. Vogler?
He looks like such a sweet child.
I have been thinking, Elisabeth, and I don't think you should still be in the hospital.
I think it is for the worse.
Since you don't want to return home, you and Sister Alma can go my house on the coast, eh?
You think I don't understand?
The impossible dream.
Not of seeming, but of being.
Conscious every moment.
Vigilant.
At the same time, the abiss between what you are for others and for yourself, the feeling of vertigo and the constant desire at least, of being exposed, of being analalized, dissected, maybe even annihilated.
Every word a lie, every gesture a falsehood, every smile a grimace.
Suicide?
¡Oh, no! That is horrible.
You would not do such a thing.
But you can stay immobile and in silence.
At least that way you don't lie.
You can close within yourself. alienate yourself?
This way you will not have to act roles, and not put on false gestures.
You think.
But, do you see? Reality is in the way, your hiding place is not impenetrable.
Life sweeps in through everywhere.
And you are obliged to react.
No one asks if it is real or unreal, if you are true or false.
The question is only important in theatre.
And almost not even there.
I understand you, Elisabeth.
I understand that you are in silence, that you are immobile, that you have placed this lack of will in such a fantastic system.
I understand you and admire you.
I think you should maintain this role until it ends, until it stops being interesting.
The you can leave it.
The same way that you left little by little the others.
Mrs. Vogler and the sister left for the the doctor's house at the end of the summer.
Being close to the sea produced a favorable effect on the actress.
The apathy that had crippled her was left behind for long walks, fishing, cooking, writing letters and other entertainments.
Sister Alma enjoyed her rural reclusion and her patient.
Don't you know that it's bad luck compare hands?
Elisabeth, may I read you something from my book?
Oh, am I bothering you?
It starts like this:
"All the anxiety that we carry with us, our frustrated dreams, the incomprehensible cruelty, our fear of extinction, the interior painful view of our terrestrial condition, have slowly eroded our hope and any other salvation.
The bellow of our faith and doubt against darkness and silence it is one of our most terrible tests of our abandonment and of our terrified and indescribable knowledge."
Do you think it is like this?
I don't believe it.
Change...
My worst defect is laziness and later
I feel guilty.
Karl-Henrik fights with me because of my lack of ambition.
He says I go about like a zombie.
I think that's unfair.
In exams I was the best from my group.
But it's certain that he refers to something else.
You know?
Sorry.
Do you know what I sometimes think?
In the hospital where I was examined there is a home for elderly nurses.
Those that always lived for their work. Always in uniform.
They live in their small rooms.
Imagine all your life dedicated to something.
I mean to say, believing in something, carrying out, believing that your life has a purpose.
I like things that way.
Clinging to one thing intensely, and nothing else matters.
It should be done.
Meaning something to the rest.
You don't think the same?
I know it seems childish, but I believe in it.
OH my god!, look at the rain!
Ah, yes!
He was married.
We had a relationship for five years.
Then he was tired, ofcourse.
I was so much in love, that's for sure, and he was the first.
I remember everything like a long torment.
Long periods of pain and later short periods of...
It as if you teach me to smoke.
He used to smoke a lot.
Thinking about it now, it is really common, cheap fiction.
In a certain way, it was never real.
I don't know how to describe it.
At least,
I was never real for him.
My pain was real, that's certain.
It seems that I was part of it, but in a disagreable manner, like it had to that way.
Including the things we said to each other...
Many people have told me that that I am a good listerner.
Funny, eh?
But no one has bothered to listen to me.
Like you are doing now.
You are listening.
I think you are the first person to have listened to me.
It can't be that interesting.
I think it might be better to read a book.
God!, and I continue.
Am I bothering you?
It is so nice to talk. one feels so warm and well.
I have never felt this way in my life.
I always wanted a sister and I only have a bunch of brothers. Seven.
Funny, eh?
And then I arrived.
All of my life has been sorrounded by boys.
I like boys, but you should know that with all of your acting experience.
I really like Karl-Henrik .
But, as you know, you only love one time.
I am faithful to him.
In my profession there are opportunities,
I am telling you.
Karl-Henrik and I had rented a house next to the sea.
It was June and we were alone.
One day, Karl-Henrik had to go to the city, and I went to the beach alone.
It was trully great.
There was also another girl.
She lived in a nearby island, but had come to our beach because it was facing the south and much more protected.
And we layed down to sunbathed completely naked.
We slept a little, and then we rubbed suntan oil.
We had on those cheap straw hats...
Mine had a blue ribbon.
I was laying and looking from underneath it.
I contemplated the view, the sea and the sun.
It was so very strange.
Suddenly I saw two figures jumping from the rocks and on top of us.
They would hide and then spy after us.
"There are two boys looking at us", I said to her.
She was called Katarina.
"Well then, let them look", she said.
And then she turned around.
It was a very strange sensation.
I wanted to hide and dress, but I just stayed still face down, with my ass on the air, totally ashamed, totally quiet.
The whole time I had Katarina next to me, with her thick chest and thighs.
She was there, laying, laughing a little to herself.
Suddendly I saw the two boys getting close and looking.
I saw that they were extremely young.
Then , one of them, the bolder one, got right close to us and then he started crouching next to Katarina.
He pretended to be holding his foot and he seated to touch his toes.
I was feeling totally strange.
Then unexpectedly Katarina said:
"Well aren't going to get on top?"
And then she touched his hand and helped him get undressed.
Suddenly he was on top of her, and she was helping and was holding his behind.
The other boy simply sat and observed.
I heard Katarina whisper on his ear and laugh.
I had his face directly in front of mine.
It was all red and swollen.
Suddenly I turned around and said: Aren't you going to come with me?"
Katarina said: "Now go with her".
And he left her and landed on me, completely hard.
He grabbed one of my breasts.
God, how it hurt!
And in some way I was ready and I came immediately...
I was going to tell him:
"Be careful so I won't be pregnant", when he came. I felt...
I felt , for the first time in my life, how he poured inside me.
He grabbed me by the shoulders and arched backwards.
I came again and again.
Katarina was now on his side, looking at him, and held him from behind.
When he came, she hugged him and grabbed his hand to masterbate with.
When she came,she cried so much.
Then we all three started to laugh.
We called the other boy that was seating.
His name was Peter.
He was confused, and with the aspect of being completly frozen in the sun.
Katarina unbuttoned his pants and started to play with him.
He came in her mouth.
He bent forward and started to kiss her on her back.
She turned around, grabbed his head with both hands and offered her breast.
The other boy was so excited , that we both started again.
It was as good as the first time.
Then we swamp and said good bye.
When I returned home, Karl-Henrik had was home.
We dined together and drank the red wine he had brought.
Then we slept together.
Never had it been that good, not before or after.
Can you understand?
I ended up pregnant, but ofcourse.
Karl-Henrik, which was studying medicine, took me to a friend and had it aborted.
We were both happy.
We did not want children.
Well at least for the moment.
It didn't make sense.
Him and I did not fit.
Later one has a bad conscience for the little things,
Do you understand?
What happens with everything you believe in?
Isn't it needed?
Can you be one and the same person in a time?
I mean to say,
I was two people?
God, I am so dumb!
In any case, I don't have any reason for whining.
Wait, I am going to go get a tissue.
It is almost daylight and it keeps on raining.
Imagine, I have been talking without stoping.
I have been speaking and you have been listening.
What a bore it must be for you!
What interest can be my life be to you?
One should be like you.
You know what I saw when I say your movie last night?
When I got home, I saw myself in the mirror and thought:
"we are the same."
Don't misunderstande me, you are much more better looking, but we are similar.
I think I could become you, if I made a real effort.
I mean from the inside.
You could become me like this, with nothing else.
Although your soul would be much bigger.
I would overflow all over.
You should sleep, if not, you will sleep on the table.
No, I should sleep,
If not, I will sleep on the table and that would be a bit uncomfortable.
Good night.
Listen, Elisabeth...
Did you call me last night?
Last night, were you in my bedroom?
Do you also want me to take your mail.
Can you give me a sip?
Good bye.
"Dear doctor: I always wanted to live this way.
This silence, to live isolated, feeling how the maltreated soul started to finally heal.
Alma is spoiling me in the most moving manner.
I think, by the way, that she is enjoying it and that she likes me a lot, she is even excited in a delicious and unconscious way.
It is fun to study her.
Sometimes she cries for past sins, like an orgiastic episode with an unknown guy.
Followed by an abortion.
Complains that her life's concepts dont agree with her actions. "
I see that you are reading theatre.
That is a good sign.
I will tell the doctor.
Don't you think we should leave soon?
I am starting to miss the city.
Don't you?
Would you really like to make me happy?
I know it is a sacrifice, but
Ineed your help right now.
It is nothing dangerous.
I want you to talk to me.
It doesn't have to be anything special. Anything.
What are we having for dinner or if you think that the water is cold after a storm or too cold to go swimming.
We should only need to speak a few minutes.
One minuto.
You could read it from your book.
Only some words.
I must not try to get upset.
You stay in silence, that is yours.
But I now need you to speak to me.
Mi dear wife, can't you say not even a simple word?
I knew you would oppose.
You can not know how I feel.
I always thought that the great artist felt great compasion for the rest, that he created from a great understanding of sympathy and the necessity to help.
Stupid me.
You have used me!
Now that you don't need me you throw me without more!
Yes, I hear very well how it sounds!, how false it sounds!
You have used me and now you get rid of me!
Every word!
And then, this glasses!
You have really hurt me.
You have laughed behind my back.
I read the letter you sent the doctor, it wasn't sealed.
And I read it all!
You made me talk!
You made me say things that I would never have told anyone.
And you tell them!
A study, eh?
¡You aren't...!
Well now you are going to talk, if you have something to say!
You are a rotten...!
¡No, still!
You were really scared, eh?
For one second you have really been afraid, no? a real fear of death, eh?
You thought that Alma had become crazy.
What kind of person are really?
Or do you think like this:
"I will always remember that face, that tone of voice, that expression."
I will give something that you will not forget!
You like, right?
For me it is not that simple... nor that funny.
But you always had your smile.
It must be like that?
Is it really important not to lie? to speak with a truthful tone?
Can one live without speaking freely?
To Lie, flee and avoid things.
Isn't it better let oneself and be lazy and forgetful, false?
Maybe you would be better if you allowed yourself to be what you are.
No, you don't understand.
You don't understand what I am saying.
YOu are inaccessible.
They said you were mentally sane, but your crazyness is the worst.
You act as if you were sane.
You do it so well that all believe you.
All except for me, because I know how rotten you are.
What am I doing?
¡Elisabeth!
¡Elisabeth, forgive me!
I have behaved like an idiot,
I don't know what's happened to me.
I am here to help you, but when I saw that horrible letter...
I felt very betrayed.
You asked me to talk about myself.
It was nice, you seemed to compassionate.
I had drank to much...
It was so nice to be able to talk about that.
I was also flattered because a great actress was listening.
I thought it would be alright to tell it, if it would help you.
But that is terrible, really?
Total exhibitioniscm!
Elisabeth, I want you to forgive me.
I value you very much, you mean so much to me.
I have learned so much from you,
I don't want us to separate like enemies.
Don't you want to forgive me!
You have to much pride!
You are not humiliating yourself, because you don't have to do it.
I will not do it! I will not do it!
We don't speak, we don't listen, we don't understand...
Elisabeth?
What does it mean to be able...?
When you sleep your face is flaccid.
The face is swollen and ugly.
You have an ugly wrinkle on the face.
You smell of sleep and tears .
I see your pulse beat on your throat.
You have a scar that you normally cover with makeup.
¡Elisabeth!
¡Elisabeth!
Is calling again.
I will find out what they want from us.
Here, far, in our solitude.
¡Elisabeth!
Elisabeth?
Sorry if I have frightened you.
I am not Elisabeth.
I don't come here asking you for anything.
I didn't want to bother you.
You think I don't understand?
The doctor explained things.
The most difficult is explaining to the child.
I do what I can.
There something that lies deep that is difficult to see.
You love someone; to be exact, you say you love someone.
It is incomprehensible. Intangible, like words, that's it.
Mrs. Vogler, I am not your wife.
YOu are also loved.
You have created a small sisterhood.
It generates security.
Do you see the posibility of it lasting, isn't it like that?
How can I say everything that I have thought without loosing myself, without borring you?
I love you, just as I had loved you before.
No, don't be so anxious, my loved one.
We have each other.
We have faith, we know our mutual thoughts.
We love another.
It is true, right?
The most important thing is the effort, not what we obtain, right?
See each other like children.
Defenceless, tormented, alone...
Elisabeth...
Tell the boy that I will go soon.
That mom has been sick, but that she has been longing to see her little one.
Remember to buy him a gift from mommy.
You know that I have so much tenderness for you...
It is almost dificult to bear.
I don't know what to do with my tenderness.
I live of from kindness.
Elisabeth, do you like being with me? is it nice?
You are a wonderful lover, you know that. and I love you...
Curse me! Please leave me !
¡No, I can't!
I can't endure it anymore!
Leave me in peace! It is a shame!
Everything is a shame!
Leave me in peace!
¡Estoy fría, podrida e indiferente!
Everything is a lie or imitations!
Everything!
Elisabeth,
What do you have there?
What are you hiding under your hand?
Let me see.
It the picture of your boy, the one you had torn.
We should talk about it.
Tell me about it, Elisabeth.
Then I will do it.
It was one night at a party, right?
It was late and very loud.
The dawn was approaching, and someone in the group said:
"Elisabeth, like a woman and an artist you have it... practically everything under your belt, but you lack motherly feelings."
You laughed becuase you thought that it was nonsense.
After a while, you started to think about what he said.
It worried you more and more.
You let your husband impregnate you.
You wanted to be a mother.
When you found out that it was true, you became afraid.
The responsibility frightened you, to be tied, to leave the theatre.
The pain scared you, death, that your body would swell.
But you acted out the role.
The role of a future young and happy mother.
The whole world said:
"She is so beautiful."
"She has never been so beautiful"
Mean while, you tried to abort several times.
But you failed.
When you saw that it was irreversible, you started to hate the baby and wanted a still birth.
You wished that the baby was dead.
You wanted a dead baby.
It was a long and difficult birth.
You were in pain for several days.
Finally, the baby was born using forceps.
You saw with disgust and terror your crying child and murmurred:
"Can't you die soon?"
"Can you die?"
But he survived.
The boy cried day and night.
And you hated him.
You were afraid and felt guilty.
Finally relatives and a sitter took care of the baby.
You could now get up from bed and return to theatre.
But your pain had not ended.
The boy saw himself trapped by an inmeasurable love for his mother.
You defend yourself.
You defend yourself desperately.
You feel that you can't correspond.
And you try and keep trying, but between you there is only cruel and rough encounters.
You can't do it.
You are cold and indifferent.
He looks at you.
He loves you and he is so tender...
You want to hit him, because he doesn't live you alone.
You think he is repulsive, with his thick lips and ulgy body , with his wet and begging eyes.
He is repulsive and you are afraid.
What are you hiding under your hand?
Let me see.
It is the picture of your boy, the one you tore.
We should talk about it.
Tell me about it, Elisabeth.
Then I will do it.
It was a night at a party, right?
It was late and loud.
Dawn was approaching and someone from the group said:
"Elisabeth, like a woman and and artist you have it practically everything under your belt, but you lack motherly feelings."
You laughed because you thought it was nonsense.
After a while, you started to think about what he said.
It worried you more and more.
You let your husband impregnate you.
You wanted to be a mother.
When you found out that it was true, you became afraid.
The responsibility frightened you, to be tied, to leave the theatre.
The pain scare you, death, that your body would swell.
But you played the role.
The role of a future young and happy mother.
The whole world said:
"You are so beautiful.
You've never been so beautiful."
Mean while, you tried to abort several times.
But you failed.
When you saw that it was irreversible
You started to hate the baby and you wished a still birth.
You wished that the baby would die.
You wanted a dead baby.
It was a long and difficult birth.
You were in pain for several days.
Finally, the baby was born using forceps.
You was with disgust and terror your crying child and murmurred:
"Can't you die soon?"
"Can you die?"
The day cried day and night and you hated him.
You were afraid and felt guilty.
Finally some relatives and a sitter took care of the baby.
You could now get up from bed and return to theatre.
But the suffering did not end.
The boy was trapped with an inmeasurable love for his mother.
You defend desperately.
You feel that you can't correspond.
And you try and keep trying, but between you there is only cruel and rough encounters.
You can't do it.
You are cold and indifferent.
He looks at you.
He loves us and is tender...
You want to hit him because he doesn't leave you in peace.
You think he is repulsive, with his thick mouth and ugly body, with his wet and begging eyes.
He is repulsive and you are afraid.
No!
I am not like you.
I do not feel like you.
I am Sister Alma,
I am only here to help you.
I am not Elisabeth Vogler!
You are Elisabeth Vogler!
I would like to have...!
I adore...!
I don't have...
I've learnt so much.
We'll see how long I can last.
I will never be like you, never.
I change all the time.
You can do whatever you like, it won't affect me.
Talking is useless.
Put out the candle.
It is like being another.
Now no, no. No, no.
Cautious and outside time.
Unforseen.
When it was supossed to occur, it didn't, and therefore, failed.
Stay where you are!
But I should do it.
Not inward, no...
Get ready and tell the others...
The inconsolable and, maybe...
Here, yes...
But, what is closer...?
What do you call it...?
No, no, no...
Us, our, you, me...
Many words and such nausea...
Incomprehensible pain.
Now listen to me.
Repeat after me.
Nothing...
Nothing.
No, nothing...
Nothing.
That's it.
That's good.
That's how it should be.
All right, Charlie.
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- l already told you.
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.
- What's the password?
- ''I've come to Grandma's funeral.''
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie. lf you want a ringside table, just say you're a pallbearer.
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?
I'd better blow. lf Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Give me five minutes, then hit 'em with everything you got.
You betcha.
Good evening, sir.
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can l do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral. l haven't seen you at our services before.
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.
Well, if you gotta go, that's the way to do it.
Follow me, please.
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour mash coffee...
Scotch. Make it a demitasse, with soda on the side.
Wait a minute. Haven't you got a pew not so close to the band?
How about that one over there?
Sorry, but that's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Oops.
Hey, l want another cup of coffee. l want another cup of coffee.
Better bring a check in case the joint is raided.
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.
You wanna blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay everyone something on account.
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track and bet it all on Greased Lightning.
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.
Max the waiter knows the electrician that wires the rabbit.
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1 .
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks.
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.
Well, don't look now, but the whole town is underwater.
Four, three, two, one.
All right, everybody. This is a raid.
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest. l want another cup of coffee.
All right, Spats.
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.
- l don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you with a pair of special spats - striped.
Big joke. What's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.
Me? I'm just a customer.
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
Buttermilk.
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?
Come on. On your feet.
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men. l wan' another cuppa coffee.
That solves one problem. Now we don't have to worry about who to pay first.
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.
At Moe's Deli no more knockwurst on credit.
We can't borrow from the girls - they're on the way to jail. l wonder how much Sam the bookie will give us for our overcoats.
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.
- Jerry, l told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze. lt is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's 10-1 .
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.
Greased Lightning.
- l oughta have my head examined.
- l thought you weren't talkin' to me.
The bull fiddle's dressed warmer than l am.
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.
Thank you.
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.
Thank you. l can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger, l got a fever, l got a hole in my shoe... lf you gave me a chance, we could be living like kings.
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.
Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?
No, your bass. lf we hock that and my sax...
Are you crazy? We're up the creek and you wanna hock the paddle.
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do l care? Freeze.
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.
Thank you.
Joe. Come back here.
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night, l can explain.
What a heel. l spend $4 to get my hair marcelled, l buy me a brand-new negligee, l bake him a great big pizza pie.
- And where were you?
- Where were you?
- With you.
- Me?
Remember? You had this bad tooth. lt was impacted. His jaw was swoll out. lt was?
Oh, yeah.
- l took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.
- Type O.
- Oh?
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you to the swellest restaurant in town.
How about it? Has Poliakoff got anyzhing for us? We're desperate.
Well, it just so happens he is looking for a bass.
And a sax.
Right?
Right.
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.
They need a couple of girls on sax and bass.
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. l got a job for ya.
Gladys. Are ya there?
Gladys!
Meshugeneh.
Played 1 1 2 hours at a marathon dance.
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.
And Cora Jackson?
Last l heard, she was playin' with the Salvation Army.
Drexel 9044.
Those idiot broads.
Here we are, packed and ready to leave for Miami, and what happens?
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman and the bass gets pregnant.
Bienstock, l oughta fire you.
Me? I'm the manager, not the night watchman.
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.
What's she doing in Philadelphia?
On the level?
Bessie let her hair grow and is playing with Stokowski.
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.
How about Rosemary Schultz?
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.
We might as well do the same if we don't find two dames by tonight.
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.
Bye, Sig. l wonder if I've got room for another ulcer.
Nellie, get me long-distance.
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.
The William Morris Agency in New York.
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of a band is it?
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.
And you gotta be girls.
No, we couldn't.
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?
Yeah. Good old Nellie. l could wring her neck.
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.
When you booked us with the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.
His empty stomach has gone to his head.
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could borrow clothes from the chorus girls.
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on. lf you wanna pick up a little money tonight, at the University of lllinois they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.
We'll take it.
$6 a man. Be on the campus at Urbana at 8 o'clock.
All the way to Urbana for a one-night stand?
It's $12. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.
You don't have two girl musicians available, do you?
A sax player and a bass?
- lf William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?
- I'll find something.
- Like what?
Don't crowd me.
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really? l just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza.
Then you'll be in all evening?
Yes, Joe.
Good. Then you won't be needing your car.
My car? Why, you...
Isn't he a bit of terrific?
We coulda had three weeks in Florida, all expenses paid.
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...
Knock it off, will ya?
Possible straight, possible nothing, and a pair of eights.
All right, drop 'em, you guys.
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.
Musicians.
Wise guys.
OK, let's go. Aces bet.
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?
And while you're at it, fill it up.
All right, everybody. Hands up.
Face the wall.
You too, Toothpick.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey. Join us.
OK, boss.
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- l just dropped in to pay my respects.
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- l wouldn't say that.
You recommended my mortuary to your friends.
- l don't know what you mean.
- Now l got all those coffins on my hands.
- l hate to see 'em go to waste.
- l had nothin' to do with it.
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.
No, Spats. Please, no. l think I'm gonna be sick.
All right, come on outta there.
Come on.
Come on.
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.
Besides, it's none of our business if you guys wanna bump each other off.
Say... Don't l know you two from somewhere?
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.
There's a dance tonight.
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...
You're not goin' nowhere.
- We're not?
- l don't like no witnesses.
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.
Not even air.
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later. l think they got me.
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood? lf they catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O. Come on.
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.
Quick, gimme a nickel.
You're gonna call the police?
We'd never live to testify against Spats Colombo.
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.
We will get out of town, but we're gonna shave.
At a time like this? They wanna blast our heads off, and you wanna shave.
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?
Hello. Mr Poliakoff? l understand you're looking for a couple of girl musicians.
Florida Limited leaving on track one for Washington,
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.
All aboard.
What now?
How do they keep their balance in these things?
Must be the way the weight is distributed. Now come on. lt is so draughty.
They must catch cold all the time.
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- l feel naked.
- l feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?
It's no use. We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine, and this was your idea in the first place.
Look at that. Look how she moves.
That's just like Jell-O on springs.
They must have some sort of built-in motor or something. l tell ya, it's a whole different sex.
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.
As soon as we're in Florida we'll blow this whole setup.
You will not talk me into...
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered in North Side garage.
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.
My name is Josephine.
I'm Daphne.
Saxophone, bass. Am l glad to see you girls. You saved our lives.
Likewise, I'm sure.
Where did you girls play before?
Here, there and... around, and...
We spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
All aboard.
You're in berths 7 and 7A.
7 and 7A.
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.
Oh. The feeling's mutual.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.
Looks like Poliakoff sent a couple of real ladies.
You'd better tell the other girls to watch their language.
What are you...?
Daphne? l never did like the name Geraldine.
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.
My name is Josephine. Sax.
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, l don't wear one myself.
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me? l have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.
Say, do you know the one about the girl tuba player who was stranded on an island with a one-legged jockey?
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.
They went to a conservatory.
How about that talent, huh?
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.
When l was a kid, Joe, l dreamed l was locked up overnight in a pastry shop.
And there was goodies all around.
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.
Yeah, sure, Joe.
Not there. That's the emergency brake.
Now you've done it.
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.
This way, Daphne.
Now you tore the other one.
Terribly sorry.
It's OK. l was scared it was Sweet Sue.
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what? lf they catch me once more, they'll kick me out of the band.
Are you the replacement for the bass and sax?
That's us. And I'm Daphne.
This is Joe... sephine.
Come in.
I'm Sugar Cane.
- Sugar Cane?
- l changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.
- Polish?
- Yes. l come from this musical family.
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio. l play the ukulele, and l sing, too. l don't have much of a voice, but this isn't much of a band, either.
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.
I'll take a rain check. l don't want you to think I'm a drinker. l can stop if l want to, only l don't want to.
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.
All the girls drink. But I'm the one that gets caught. Story of my life. l always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.
We have been playing with the wrong bands.
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Forget it. One false move and we're off the train.
Then it's the police, the papers and the Mob in Chicago.
Boy, would l love to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look...
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.
You tore 'em again.
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?
No. Funerals.
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.
We'll try.
How did those holes get there?
Those? l don't know.
Mice?
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.
Bienstock!
Yes, Sue? l thought l made it clear that l don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?
Come on, now. Speak up.
- Sugar, l warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.
I've had it. ln Kansas you smuggled liquor in a shampoo bottle.
Before that you had a pint in your ukelele...
Mr Bienstock, could l have my flask?
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.
Give me that.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- l thought you said three years.
We got time off for good behaviour.
There are two things l will not put up with during working hours: liquor and men.
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.
And they all just want one thing from a girl. l beg your pardon, miss.
All right, girls. From the top again.
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.
Good night, Gloria.
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.
How about that ''toodle-oo''.
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
I'm a...
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.
I'm a girl.
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
I'm a girl.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
Honey? Hey, she called me ''honey''.
Ooh, honey.
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.
Supposin' l gotta go... like for a drink of water or something.
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose l lose.
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's something funny about those new girls.
- Funny? ln what way?
- l don't know, but l can feel it right here.
Having an ulcer is like having a burglar alarm go off inside you.
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.
I'm a girl. I'm a girl. l wish l were dead.
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...
Daphne.
Sugar. l wanted to thank you for covering up for me. You're a real pal.
It's nothing. l just thought that us girls should stick together. lf it wasn't for you, they'd have kicked me off the train.
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
It's freezing outside. l mean, when l think about you and your poor ukulele... lf there's ever anyzhing l can do for you... l can think of a million things.
That's one of 'em.
It's Sweet Sue. l don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.
Maybe I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
You stay here as long as you like.
I'm not crowding you, am l?
No. It's nice and cosy.
When l was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.
We'd cuddle up under the covers and pretend we were lost in a dark cave and were trying to find our way out.
Very interesting.
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?
Here, let me warm them up a little.
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.
- I'd better go before l catch something.
- Not that sick.
I've got very low resistance.
Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, my dear, the best thing in the world is a shot of whiskey.
- You've got some?
- l know where to get it.
Don't move.
- Hold on.
- OK.
Up. Up.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?
Oh, l tell you, my dear, this is the only way to travel.
Put on the lights. l can't see what I'm doing.
No lights. We don't want them to know.
- But l might spill some.
- So spill it.
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.
This may even turn out to be a surprise party.
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.
- When?
- Better have a drink first.
That'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
Is this a private clambake?
It's private. Please, go away.
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.
Manhattans? At this time of night?
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.
You're gonna spoil my surprise.
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.
Go get some paper cups.
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away. l brought some cheese and crackers.
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?
Girls, you'll wake up the neighbours downstairs.
Watch that corkscrew.
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.
Will you girls go away and form your own party?
Here's the cocktail shaker.
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.
1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck.
1 2 of you will have to get out.
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.
Hey. Have you got any maraschino cherries on you?
Never mind.
Maraschino cherries?
What's going on here?
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?
It's not my fault. l didn't invite 'em.
Come on, girls, break it up.
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.
Get out.
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.
Put it here.
Sugar, you're gonna get into a lot of trouble.
You'd better keep a lookout. lf Bienstock catches you again...
What's the matter with you, anyway?
I'm not very bright, l guess. l wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb. lf l had any brains, l wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.
Well, why'd you take this job? l used to sing with male bands, but l can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Who, me?
That's what I'm running away from. l worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.
- Rough?
- I'll say.
- You can't trust those guys.
- l can't trust myself. l have this thing about saxophone players.
Especially tenor sax.
- Really?
- l don't know why, but they curdle me.
All they have to do is play eight bars of
''Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby'' and l get goose-pimply all over, and l come to 'em.
- That so?
- Every time.
You know, l play tenor sax.
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why l joined this band.
Safety first. Anyzhing to get away from those bums.
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.
You think this is gonna be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.
The next thing you know, they're borrowing money from you, spending it on other dames and betting on horses.
You don't say.
Then one morning you wake up, the guy's gone, the sax's gone.
All that's left is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.
You pull yourself together, you go on to the next job, the next saxophone player.
It's the same thing all over again.
You see what l mean? Not very bright.
Brains aren't everyzhing. l can tell you one thing. It's not gonna happen to me again - ever.
I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop. lce. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.
- About what?
- The future.
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.
They all go south for the winter, like birds.
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- l don't care how rich he is.
As long as he has a yacht, a private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
With money like Rockefeller and shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.
- l want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless.
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.
They get those weak eyes from reading.
Those long, tiny little columns in The Wall Street Journal.
That bass fiddle, she sure knows how to throw a party.
Hot-diggety-dog.
Well, happy days. l hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
So the one-legged jockey said...
What did he say?
So the one-legged jockey said: ''Don't worry about me, baby. l ride side-saddle.''
I'm terribly sorry. l seem to have hiccups.
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck. l think... Ow. You dropped it.
Oh, that's cold.
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.
Help. Please. Help. Help.
Josephine.
Please stop that. Stop that.
- What happened?
- Search me. l mean, I'll see.
All right, what's goin' on around here?
Bienstock!
Are we in Florida?
Sugar?
Here. I'll carry the instruments.
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.
Isn't she a sweetheart?
How do you do?
Zowie!
There they are. More millionaires than you can shake a stick at. l bet there isn't one under 75.
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.
Let's hope they brought their grandsons along.
Yes.
Pardon me, miss.
- May l?
- Help yourself.
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.
I'm Cinderella the Second. lf there's one thing l admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Me, too. Bye-bye.
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.
Aren't you a sweetheart. lt certainly is delightful having young blood around here.
Personally, I'm type O.
I've always been fascinated by show business. ls that so?
As a matter of fact, it's cost my family quite a bit of money.
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?
Mama is keeping score.
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- l wouldn't wonder.
So when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.
She thinks I'm out on my yacht, deep-sea fishing.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish. lf l promise not to be a naughty boy, how about dinner?
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.
Oh, fascinating.
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time, l slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.
She could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes.
Zowie!
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?
- This is where l get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
You don't get off that easy.
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.
And keep your eyes on the road.
What kind of a girl do you think l am, Mr Fielding?
- Oh, please. lt won't happen again.
- I'll say.
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.
Please, miss...
Zowie!
All right, girls. Here are your room assignments.
My glasses. Where are my glasses?
Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono when you ring for room service.
Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?
Rosella and Emily in 41 5...
- l wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do l.
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.
414... That's the same room number l had in Cincinnati, my last time around with a male band.
What a heel he was.
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was l ever crazy about him.
At two in the morning he sent me down for hot dogs and potato salad.
They were out of potato salad, so l brought coleslaw.
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.
You're gonna meet a millionaire - a young one.
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.
Oh. Are these your bags?
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.
- l suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.
After all, you work here and l work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?
I'm workin' the night shift and l got a bottle of gin stashed away.
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way l like 'em - big and sassy.
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?
- l got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?
I'm not even pretty.
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.
I'm sick of being the flag. l wanna be a bull again.
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?
You promised me that the minute we hit Florida we'd beat it.
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.
Spats Colombo is looking for us in every male band in the country.
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?
Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish? l know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.
- Me, after Sugar?
- l saw the both of you in that bus.
All lovey-dovey and whisperin' and borrowin' each other's lipstick.
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
Are you decent?
Come in.
You girls seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials? lt has all my resort clothes.
- No, we haven't.
- l can't understand it.
First my glasses disappear, then one of my suitcases.
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.
You haven't got a bathing suit. l don't have one either.
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.
- How about you, Josephine?
- l think I'll soak in a hot tub.
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her, we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?
Just a little trick l picked up in the elevator.
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.
Daphne. l had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should've seen me before l went on a diet. l mean your shoulders and your arms.
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.
- There's one thing l envy you for.
- What's that?
You're so flat-chested.
Clothes hang better on you than they do on me.
Watch out, Daphne.
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.
Junior, time for your nap.
No. l wanna play.
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!
This beach ain't big enough for the both of us.
Mommy!
Here we go. l like coffee, l like tea.
How many boys are stuck on me?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
- l don't think so.
- l wish you'd make sure.
Because when people find out who l am, they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me for three quarters of a million dollars.
- l won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.
- Who are you?
- Now, really!
Sugar!
Come on.
Honestly.
Cheerio.
- Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
You may have seen it in newspapers or magazines.
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.
Of what?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
You own a yacht?
Which one is it? The big one?
Certainly not.
With all the world unrest, nobody should have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2. l quite agree.
Tell me, who runs up that flag?
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?
No, my cocktail steward.
Look, if you're interested in whether l am married or not...
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.
I'll bet while we were talking, you made $100,000?
Could be. You play the market?
- No, the ukulele. And l sing, too.
- For your own amusement?
We are appearing at the hotel.
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...
We're just doing this for a lark.
Syncopators. Does that mean you play that very fast music... jazz?
Yeah. Real hot. l guess some like it hot. l personally prefer classical music. l do, too.
As a matter of fact, l spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Good school. Your family doesn't object to your career?
They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent.
But l don't care. lt was such a bore.
- Coming-out parties.
- lnauguration balls.
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.
And always the same 400.
It's amazing we never ran into each other before.
I'd have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You're very kind. I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless. l beg your pardon?
You see, l have a theory about men who wear glasses.
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when l know you better.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?
Maybe you could come to the hotel and hear us play.
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why? l only come ashore twice a day when the tide goes out.
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.
You might say we had a passion for shells.
That's why we named the oil company after it.
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.
Sugar!
Time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?
Happens to me all the time. l recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
His yacht? lt sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr? l heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.
She squealed on her roommate and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Yes. We have to be very careful whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?
Well, l think I'd better be going. lt was delightful meeting you both.
- You will come and hear us play?
- lf it's at all possible.
Do come. lt'll be such fun.
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. l saw him first.
Sugar, a little advice. lf l were a girl, and l am, I'd watch my step. lf I'd been watching my step, l never would have met him.
- l can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine... l can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.
Neither can l.
Let's go tell her right now.
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.
- l guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie! l can't imagine where she'd be.
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait. l have a feeling she'll show up any minute.
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.
Something tells me she's gonna come through that door in a brand-new outfit.
- Josephine.
- Oh. l didn't hear you come in.
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.
- What?
- Guess.
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.
- l met one of them.
- One of whom?
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions, glasses and a yacht.
You don't say.
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.
Daphne.
Go on. Tell me all about him.
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.
Maybe you'd better go after him if you don't want to lose him.
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.
Shells? Whatever for?
Oh, you know. The old shell game?
Daphne, you're bothering us.
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- l am?
He said he'd come to hear us play - maybe.
What do you mean, maybe? l saw the way he looked at you. He'll be there for sure. l hope so.
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?
Sugar. ls Sugar in here?
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.
See you on the bandstand, girls.
What are you tryin' to do to that girl, puttin' on a millionaire act?
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.
I've seen you pull some low tricks on women.
This is without doubt the trickiest, lowest, meanest...
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.
Joe. Don't look at me like that. lt was all a joke. l didn't mean any harm.
I'm gonna press the suit myself. Telephone.
Answer the tele...phone.
Hello?
Yes, this is 41 3.
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.
You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?
You slapped my face?
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.
Daphne can't talk right now. ls it urgent?
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show. I'll tell her.
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.
The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet little midnight snack, just the two of us.
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.
We'll have cold pheasant with champagne.
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.
And tell her I've got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.
Pushover for who? What...
Yes, Mr Fielding.
You'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat. Goodbye.
What's that you said?
- ''Zowie.'' I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?
You got it made. Fielding wants to have cold pheasant with you on his yacht.
Just the three of you on that great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance. Call him back and say I'm not goin'.
Of course you're not.
I'm going.
You're gonna be on the boat with that dirty old man?
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.
- With me?
- That's right.
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.
You can both go take a flyin' jump.
Remember, he's your date for tonight, so smile.
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.
Why do l let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am l gonna keep him ashore?
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Bull fiddle.
From satchel mouth at table seven.
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.
Never mind leaving your door open. l got a passkey.
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back. l guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.
These came for you.
For me?
It's Shell Oil.
- No!
- Yes!
He wants to have supper with me on his yacht.
He's picking me up at the pier.
- No!
- Yes.
You heard her - yes.
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht. lf my mother could only see me now. l hope my mother never finds out.
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night, reminding all you daddies out there that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.
And l intend to keep it that way.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.
There's a roadhouse down the coast...
Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.
Who?
About the roadhouse?
They have a Cuban band that's the berries.
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra and tango till dawn.
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?
You're dynamite.
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Ahoy, there.
Ahoy.
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers. l wanted them to fly orchids from our greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts. l seem to be out of gas.
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas. l mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.
Oops. There. lt seems to be stuck in reverse. l just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model. lt seems like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? lt may take a little longer.
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you. lt looked so small from the beach.
But when you're on it, it's like a cruiser or a destroyer.
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.
Which is the port and which is the starboard?
That depends on whether you're coming or going. l mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern.
And that's the bridge. So that you can get from one side of the boat to the other.
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.
And another nice thing about this yacht - lots of closet space.
Now, let me see. Where do you suppose the steward set it up? ln here.
Of course. How silly of me.
On Thursdays they always serve me in the small salon.
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
- What a beautiful fish.
- l caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
It's a member of the herring family.
A herring?
Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
They shrink when they're marinated.
- Champagne?
- l don't mind if l do.
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.
You know. Skeet shooting, dog breeding, water polo.
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?
I'll say. l had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.
I've never been completely alone with a man in the middle of the night,
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.
The coastguard will call if any icebergs appear.
It's not the icebergs.
But certain men would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.
- Harmless? How?
- l don't know how to put it, but I've got this thing about girls.
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean, like, frigid?
Well, it's more like a mental block.
When I'm with a girl, it does absolutely nothing to me.
- Have you tried?
- Have l. I'm trying all the time.
See? Nothing.
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.
Now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.
Something goes wrong inside.
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more. l was in love once, but I'd rather not talk about it.
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?
- l don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.
Well... lt was my freshman year at Princeton.
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.
Her father was the vice president of Hupmobile.
She wore glasses, too.
That summer we were at the Grand Canyon.
We were on the highest ledge watching the sunset, when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss. l took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses. l took a step toward her.
She took a step toward me.
Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up by mule. l gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.
But it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then, numb, no feelings, like my heart was shot full of Novocain.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes. All the money in the world, and what good is it?
Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me?
- ls it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.
Got a special tutor to read me books that were banned in Boston. lmported a troupe of Balinese dancers with those bells on their ankles and long fingernails.
What a waste of money.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Why?
Was that anyzhing?
Thanks just the same.
You should see a doctor - a good doctor. l have. l spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud, flat on my back.
Then there were the Mayo brothers, injections, hypnosis, mineral baths. lf l wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't say that.
There must be some girl someplace that could... lf l ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it? l may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother or one of those French upstairs girls, but could l take another crack at it?
All right, if you insist.
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out, but it's no use. l think the light switch is over there.
That's the radio.
It's like taking someone to a concert when he's tone-deaf.
You're not giving yourself a chance.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
So inhale.
Daphne,
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.
Well?
I'm not quite sure.
Would you try it again? l got a funny sensation in my toes.
Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire. l think you're on the right track. l must be. Your glasses are beginning to steam up. l never knew it could be like this.
Thank you.
They told me l was kaput, finished, all washed up.
And here you are, making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths. Now, really.
Where did you learn to kiss like that? l used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Tomorrow, remind me to send a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.
Whoops.
- Good night.
- Good morning.
How much do l owe the Milk Fund so far?
Let's make it an even million. l forgot to give you a receipt.
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?
Have l got things to tell you.
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl? l am.
What?
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.
Why not? He keeps marryin' girls all the time.
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.
And why would a guy wanna marry a guy?
Security.
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.
- I'm not stupid. l know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because l don't smoke.
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.
He wants to go to the Riviera, but l kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this. l don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.
Then we get a quick annulment, he makes a nice settlement on me and l keep gettin' those alimony cheques every month.
Jerry, listen to me.
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.
Joe, this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire.
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a... l wish l were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am l a boy.
What about my engagement present?
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.
Hey, these are real diamonds.
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?
- l guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.
After all, we don't wanna hurt Osgood's feelings.
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.
Come in. l thought l heard voices. l had to talk to somebody. l don't feel like going to sleep.
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice? lt was suicidally beautiful.
Did he get fresh?
Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.
Gee, l wish I'd been there.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night. l think he's going to propose.
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful.
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?
Well, Daphne has a beau, l have a beau... lf we could only find somebody for you.
Here l am, doll.
''Friends of ltalian Opera'' - that's us.
Register over there.
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.
Thanks.
Hiya, Spats.
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't l?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?
Little Bonaparte don't want no hardware around.
All right, you're clean.
You're not. lt ain't loaded.
Next. What's in here?
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.
- What's this?
- My mashie.
See you at the banquet, Spats.
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?
Come on, boys.
Well. Spats Colombo, if l ever saw one.
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida? l heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.
Thought I'd come in case anybody decided to sing.
Big joke.
Where were you at 3pm on St Valentine's Day?
- l was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?
It's an opera, you ignoramus.
- ln the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
The day after the shoot you sent in spats with blood on 'em. l cut myself while shaving.
- You shave with spats on?
- l sleep with my spats on.
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.
You and who else?
Me and those two witnesses you have been lookin' for all over Chicago.
Boys, know anyzhing about any garage or witnesses?
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.
Honest.
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days we're gonna dig up those two guys.
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up. l feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery from a man under false pretences.
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips if you wanna look nice for Osgood. lt'll break his heart when he finds out l can't marry him. lt'll break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.
Can't make an omelette without breakin' an egg.
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.
- Joe!
- What?
Something tells me the omelette is about to hit the fan.
Come on, Daphne.
- Going up.
- Hold it.
Three, please. l don't mean to be forward, but ain't l had the pleasure of meetin' you two broads before?
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.
Third floor.
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.
Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.
Don't call us. We'll call you. l tell you, Joe, they're onto us.
They're gonna line us up against the wall and...
The cops will find two dead dames and take us to the morgue and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight. l tell you, l will never find another man who's so good to me.
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive, we'll sell this bracelet, take the money, grab a boat to South America and hide out in a banana republic. l figured if we eat nothing but bananas, we could live there for 50 years. lf we get outta the hotel alive.
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?
We can't walk out on her without a goodbye.
You usually walk out and leave 'em with a kick in the teeth.
That's when l was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.
Ship to shore?
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice. l may throw up.
No, l didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, l never closed an eye. l never slept better. l had the most wonderful dream. l was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose.
We drifted for days and days.
You were the captain and l was the crew. l kept a lookout for icebergs, l sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails, and l wiped the steam off your glasses.
And when l woke up, l wanted to swim right back to you.
Yes...
Now, about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again right after the show.
I'm afraid not. l can't make it tonight.
Not tomorrow either. l have to leave.
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.
Where to?
South America?
That is unexpected.
You see, we have these oil interests in Venezuela. l just got a cable from Dad. The board of directors have decided on a merger.
A merger? How long will you be gone?
Quite a while.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.
You're not?
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance. lt just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...
Oh. That kind of merger.
What is she like?
According to our tax adviser, she's only so-so.
But that's the way the oil gushes.
A man in my position has a responsibility to the stockholders.
All those little people who have invested their life savings.
Of course. l understand.
At least, l think l do. l knew you would. l only wish there was something l could do for you.
But you have. You've given me all that inside information.
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.
Smart move.
By the way, did you get my flowers?
You know, those orchids from my greenhouse?
The fog finally lifted over Long lsland and they flew them down this morning.
That's strange. l sent 'em to your room.
They should have been delivered by now.
Hey, Dolores, will you see if there's any flowers outside?
Yes, they're here. White orchids. l haven't had white orchids since l was a debutante.
What's this?
What's what?
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.
Real diamonds.
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?
Not always. l wanted you to know how grateful l am for what you did for me. l didn't do anyzhing. lt just happened.
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.
Well, anchors aweigh, and have a bon voyage. lf you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Goodbye, my darling. l don't know about the captain but the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.
What happened to my bracelet?
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.
It's on the level this time.
Where's that bourbon?
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- l don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.
How did you get that bracelet?
- You like it?
- l always did.
Junior gave it to me. He's gone to South America to marry another girl.
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what l call a louse. lf l were you, I'd take that bracelet and throw it back in his face.
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
How can l? No matter where l go, there'll always be a Shell station on every corner.
I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Are you crazy? The place is crawlin' with mobsters.
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?
- We'll walk. lf we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that ''we'' again.
Not that way. We don't wanna run into Spats and his chums.
Your hands clean?
Over.
OK, button my spats.
You sure dress nice, boss.
Say, boss. I've been talking with the other delegates.
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick from the garage. Had it gold-plated.
Like l was tellin' you fellas.
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.
Used to be like a rock.
- It's too bad. l think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.
How are we gonna retire him?
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie will be singin' in the same choir again.
But this time we'll make sure there are no witnesses.
Look. The two broads from the elevator.
Hey. Join us.
What's the matter with those dames?
Maybe those dames ain't dames.
Same faces, same instruments.
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago, so we'll finish the job here. Come on.
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.
What happened?
Me and Tiny had them cornered, but we lost them in the shuffle.
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.
They can't be too far away.
Thank you.
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.
It's been ten years since l elected myself president of this organisation, and, if l say so myself, you made the right choice.
Let's look at the record. ln the last fiscal year, we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.
Of course, like in every business, we had our little misunderstandings.
Let us now observe one minute of silence in memory of seven of our members from Chicago, North Side Chapter, who are unable to be with us tonight on account of bein' rubbed out.
You too, Spats.
Up.
Easy, now.
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:
For he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
OK.
And don't mess up the cake. l promised to bring back a piece to my kids.
Now, fellow delegates, there comes a time in the life of every business executive when he starts thinkin' about retirement.
No!
I'm lookin' around for somebody to fill my shoes.
I've been considerin' several candidates.
For instance, there's a certain party from Chicago,
South Side Chapter.
Now, some people say he's gotten a little too big for his spats.
But l say he's a man who'll go far.
Some people say he's gone too far.
But l say, you can't keep a good man down.
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.
The big noise he made on St Valentine's Day, that wasn't very good for public relations.
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead. l almost caught up with them today.
You mean you let 'em get away twice?
Some people would say that's real sloppy.
But l say: to err is human, to forgive divine.
And just to show you what l think of you, Spats, the boys told me you was gonna have a birthday.
So we baked you a little cake.
My birthday?
Why, it ain't for another four months.
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?
All right, boys. Now all together.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
Which nobody can deny.
Which nobody can deny.
Which nobody can deny.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
Which nobody can deny.
Big joke.
Let's get outta here.
Get those two guys.
What happened here?
There was somethin' in that cake that didn't agree with 'em.
My compliments to the chef. Nobody leaves this room till l get the recipe.
You wanna make a federal case of it?
Yeah.
They slipped through our hands.
We're watchin' the train station, roads and airport. They can't get away.
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll l tell him?
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.
Josephine.
Bienstock!
Hey. That's no dame.
None of that, Sugar.
No guy is worth it.
Grab her.
Josephine?
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.
Hi.
My friend Josephine, gonna be a bridesmaid.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.
She's so eager.
Wait for Sugar!
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- l told you, I'm not very bright.
Let's go.
You don't want me, Sugar.
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.
One of those no-goodniks you keep running away from. l know. Every time.
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.
The sweet end of the lollipop, not the coleslaw in the face and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it. l called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.
She wants you to have her wedding gown. It's white lace.
Osgood, l can't get married in your mother's dress.
She and l, we are not built the same way.
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Well... ln the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.
Doesn't matter. l smoke. l smoke all the time. l don't care. l have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player. l forgive you. l can never have children.
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.
- I'm a man.
- Well, nobody's perfect.
Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made.
From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost.
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved was, however, a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock, lacking the full frame of the picture's original aspect ratio.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material.
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards.
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment.
Those titles which appear in a different typeface (like the one used here) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline.
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.

Epigraph:
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the
City of the Workers.
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay, so high above it towered the complex known as the "Sons' Club", with its lecture halls and libraries, its theatres and stadiums.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look - !
These are your brothers!
Who - was that?
But this was what happened to Freder - the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis - as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel - to my father - !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you - !
Details - !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city... -
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city - ?
Off where they belong...
...off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, - with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...
...in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? -
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, - to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother...
...the Machine! There needs to be someone at the Machine!
There will be someone at the machine...
ME.
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me - both of you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something: that Hel was a woman - and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen - for me she lives - !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!
Do you wish to see her - ?!
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!
Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the Machine-Man - ?!
24 more hours of work - and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice - as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !
- it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come! Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel.
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?
Wait for him!
He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me - here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman -
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...
You fool! Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches:
"Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand.
And upon her forehead was a name written, a mystery:
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother of Abominations ofthe Earth.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe Saints."
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen - him and his city and his son - !
GLUTTONY
AVARICE
PRIDE
LUST
ENVY
ANGER
SLOTH
Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me...
I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Would you please wake Georgy up?
He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it - understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, - otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path - ?!
I must go on, Josaphat, - must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat - tonight when I come back...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria - ?!
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father - !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed!
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.
You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her,
I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything!
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!
All Seven Deadly Sins, on her behalf - !
Death overtakes the City - !
END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John
Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire...
But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill...
...once the best of friends... because of that woman...
...the other man... on that same evening...
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned... but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped...
...is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint - ?!
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight: it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace... but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis - ?!
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow - ?!
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh - ?!
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !
Do them in - these machines - ! !
You aren't Maria - ! ! !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide - ! ! !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City!
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !
In the attic of his home,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen:
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you - !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.
Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today - !
Death to the machines - ! !
Not one man - not one woman has stayed behind - !
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !
To the Heart-Machine - !
DANGER
Open the gates!
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing - ! !
Have you lost your minds - ??
If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers?!
Yes - you! You're Maria - !
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation:
Joh Fredersen, where is my son - ?!
Where are your children??!
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded - ! !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!
It's the witch's fault - !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil - !
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel - !
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !
Where are our children, you witch, you - ??!
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !
To the stake with her - ! !
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !
Your children... saved - ! ! !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it...
Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

I owe everything to George Bailey.
Help him, dear Father.
Joseph, Jesus and Mary, help my friend Mr. Bailey.
Help my son George tonight.
He never thinks about himself, God.
That's why he's in trouble.
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God.
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight.
Please, God.
Something's the matter with Daddy.
Please bring Daddy back.
Please bring Daddy home.
Watch over him tonight.
Please bring Daddy back.
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
George Bailey?
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.
We'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
That's why I came to see you, sir.
It's that clockmaker's turn again.
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?
We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the IQ of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.
Joseph, send for Clarence.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.
Splendid. Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged.
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.
What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?
I've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir, and people are beginning to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Poor George. Sit down.
Sit down? What are we...
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally, of course. I...
Now, keep your eyes open.
See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.
Begin to see something?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful.
Yay! Yippee!
Okay, boys, let's go.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem. George Bailey.
A boy?
That's him when he was 12 back in 1919.
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Come on, Marty.
Let's go, Marty!
Attaboy, Marty.
Hee-haw!
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!
Here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey.
I'm not scared.
Come on, Harry.
Let's go, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
Help, George, help!
Help!
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.
George saved his brother's life that day, but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear.
Cost him his hearing in that ear.
It was weeks before he was able to go back to his after-school job at old man Gower's drugstore.
Mr. Potter.
Who's that, a king?
That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county.
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
You're late.
Yes, sir.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mary.
Hello, Violet.
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.
I'm still thinking.
Shoelaces?
Please, Georgie.
I like him.
You like every boy.
What's wrong with that?
Here you are.
Help me down?
Help you down?
Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts?
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?
Lookit here.
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.
A new magazine. I never saw it before.
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.
I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Is this the ear you can't hear on?
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives.
Wait and see.
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir.
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?
No.
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.
I'll get them, sir.
Quick, take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine.
She's waiting for them.
Yes, sir.
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Yeah.
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, George.
Mr. Gower, I...
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.
It's shaping up into a storm.
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?
I should have called him yesterday.
Switch it inside.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.
Well, then, foreclose.
I can't do that.
These families have children.
- Pop.
- They're not my children.
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?
You have no family, no children.
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
He's not a failure!
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...
- Run along, run along.
- ...bigger than him,
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.
I'll talk to you tonight.
What?
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
I... You...
Didn't you hear what I said?
Yes, sir. I...
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?
Why didn't you deliver them right away?
Don't you know that boy's very sick?
You're hurting my sore ear.
You lazy loafer.
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.
You put something wrong in those capsules.
I know you're unhappy.
You got the telegram, and you're upset.
You put something bad in those capsules.
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.
Just look and see what you did.
The bottle you took the powder from, it's poison.
I tell you, it's poison.
I know you feel bad.
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.
I know how you're feeling.
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.
Oh, George. George.
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.
Combination lock.
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.
I want a big one.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist?
That's the kid.
It's a good face. I like it.
I like George Bailey.
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Not a soul.
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.
I want something for 1,001 nights with plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.
Great big thing, about...
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.
I don't suppose you'd like this old secondhand job, would you?
Now you're talking.
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.
- How much this cost?
- No charge.
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."
That's right.
Well, what's my name doing on it?
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?
What boat are you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.
Forget it.
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
Avast there, Captain Cook!
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous fran莽ais, mister?
Hey, send us some of those picture postcards, will you, George?
Hey, George, don't take any plug nickels.
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.
Hey, Ernie!
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.
How about driving me home in style?
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hello, Violet.
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.
This old thing?
Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.
No, thanks.
I think I'll go home and see what the wife's doing.
Family man.
George, Harry, you're shaking the house down.
Stop it.
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!
That's why all children should be girls.
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.
Everything's getting cold, and you know how long we've been waiting for you.
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.
Oh, you two idiots.
George, sit down and have dinner.
- Fine.
- I've eaten.
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party? Look at you!
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta take over a lot of plates and things.
What plates?
Mom, I'm chairman of the Eats Committee.
We only need a couple of dozen.
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.
What's the matter? You look tired.
I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
What's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind.
Sick in his soul, if he has one.
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.
He hates us mostly, I guess.
Gangway. Gangway.
- So long, Pop.
- So long.
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.
Put those things in the car, and I'll get your tie and studs ready for you. Now, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.
You coming later, George?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls, and we're gonna use that new floor tonight, too.
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.
Oh, Pop, just a little?
No, Son. Not one drop.
Boys and girls and music.
Why do they need gin?
Did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much.
You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
We have that all figured out.
You see, Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan, work there for four years, then he'll go.
Pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Well, you were born older, George.
How's that?
I said you were born older.
I suppose you've decided what you want to do when you get out of college.
Well, you know what I've always talked about, build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.
All that stuff I've been talking about.
Still after that first million before you're 30?
I'll settle for half that in cash.
Of course, it's just a hope.
But you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
Well, I... I...
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything that's going on.
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.
You would, eh?
I know it's soon to talk about it.
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.
I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...
It's this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe.
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way, we're doing something important, satisfying a fundamental urge.
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.
And we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.
I know, Pop. I know that.
I wish I felt that...
I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...
Most of my friends have already finished college.
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.
You get yourself an education and get out of here.
Pop, you want a shock?
I think you're a great guy.
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.
I'm gonna miss old Annie.
Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Have a good time, Son.
Excuse me.
There you are.
George, hello.
You know my kid brother George.
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.
Hee-haw!
Sam Wainwright.
How are you? When did you get here?
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now.
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright they call me.
Well, freshman, looks like you're gonna make it after all, huh?
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?
Yeah, he's followed every game, and his mouth's watering.
He wants me to find out if you're gonna come along with us.
Well, I got to make some dough first.
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.
Not broken down old guys like this one.
Hee-haw!
George, welcome back.
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.
Saved us another building.
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.
A third dance... A third...
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?
George.
Marty! Well, it's old home week.
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?
Dance with her, will you?
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough already with all these kids.
Come on, be a sport.
Just dance with her one time, and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!
Don't be long, Marty.
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...
The next thing I knew, some guy came up and tripped me.
That's the reason why I came in fourth.
If it hadn't been for that, that race'd have been a cinch.
I tried to find out who it was later, but I couldn't find out.
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was, because they'd be scared.
'Cause they know what kind of a guy I am.
You remember George. This is Mary.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, well, well.
Now to get back to my story, see?
Hey, this is my dance.
Why don't you stop annoying people?
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!
The prize, a genuine loving cup.
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.
Let's go!
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Okay. What can we lose?
Hey, you're wonderful.
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?
And I've got the key.
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!
They're cheering us. We must be good.
Get out of there!
What... Oh, well.
~ Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight ~
~ And dance ~
~ By the light ~
~ Of the moon ~
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room.
I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type.
You look wonderful!
You know, if it wasn't me talking,
I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I mean, without a dress you look older.
I mean younger. You look... You just...
I'm on the thing here.
Sir, my train, please.
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
Your caboose, milady.
You may kiss my hand.
Hey.
Hey, Mary.
As I was lumberin' down the street
Down the street, down the street
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
No, you see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.
I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.
Right in the second floor, there. See?
What did you wish, George?
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world!
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum.
Then I'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build airfields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.
What, are you gonna throw a rock?
Hey, that's pretty good.
What did you wish, Mary?
Buffalo gals can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight
And
Dance by the light of the moon?
What did you wish when you threw that rock?
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.
If I told you, it might not come true.
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want? You want the moon?
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.
I'll take it.
Then what?
Well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see?
And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair.
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
How's that?
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
You want me to kiss her, huh?
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!
I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...
Mary?
Okay, I give up. Where are you?
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
Here you are. Catch.
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
This is a very interesting situation.
Please give me my robe.
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
I'd like to have my robe.
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.
Give me my robe.
I've read about things like this, but I've never...
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
My mother's way up on the corner there.
I'll call the police.
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.
Then I'm going to scream!
Maybe I could sell tickets.
Let's see. No, the point is in order to get this robe... I've got it.
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.
George! George!
George, come on home! Quick!
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.
Campbell's there now.
I think that's all we'll need you for, George.
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
I want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.
Good luck to you at school, George.
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.
And now we come to the real purpose of this meeting, to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey.
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.
George, did you hear what that buzzard...
Mr. Chairman.
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.
Peter Bailey died three months ago.
I second Mr. Potter's motion.
Very well. In that case,
I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. But before you go,
I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
I'll go further than that.
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
That's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.
That's what killed him.
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.
But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop, you know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000.
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.
I can personally vouch for his character.
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
What does that get us?
A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
Now, I say...
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
You're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that.
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan
I'll never know.
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was...
Why, in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.
Don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers?
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?
They had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home.
Wait? Wait for what?
Until their children grow up and leave them?
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000?
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
Anyway, my father didn't think so.
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
I'm not interested in your book.
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about.
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.
Well, I've said too much. I...
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.
There's just one thing more, though.
This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.
Well, we're being voted out of business after 25 years.
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."
You still want me to hang around, George?
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.
- I'm only 55.
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?
George! George!
They voted Potter down.
They want to keep it going.
You did it, George. You did it.
They got one condition, only one condition.
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary to take his father's place.
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.
As Secretary, you can hire anyone you like.
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.
Harry became a football star.
Made second team all-American.
Yeah, but what happened to George?
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loans.
There are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel.
Look at this. Here.
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted, man with construction experience."
Here's the Yukon, right here.
"Wanted, man with engineering experience."
There she blows.
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles.
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Bailey.
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.
Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.
Well, what do you know? A wife.
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?
What am I doing? Congratulations!
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!
Why don't you tell somebody?
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.
What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.
George, about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it.
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and, well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.
It was a surprise to me.
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.
And I want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw.
Here, have some popcorn.
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.
Ruth, this...
What about this job?
Well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.
Not much money, but good future, you know.
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.
Hey, Joe.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.
What did you say? Huh?
Maybe I'd better go home.
Where's my hat? Where's my...
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?
Right down here.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?
Now you just turn this way and then right straight down there.
Oh, that way, huh?
~ My wild Irish rose ~
I'm all right. I'm all right.
~ The sweetest flower I know ~
Hello, Ma.
That's for nothing.
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that'll help you find the answers, George.
Stop that grunting.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure. Sam Wainwright.
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.
I don't know about war.
Mother of mine, I can see right through you right to your back-collar button.
Trying to get rid of me, huh?
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,
I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Oh, George.
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction...
This direction.
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.
I think I got a date.
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?
We'll wait for you, baby.
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.
- What gives?
- Nothing.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things?
Yes.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it.
Then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.
I just happened to be passing by here.
Yes, so I noticed.
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?
About coming in.
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know?
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.
I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by here.
What do you...
Went for a walk. That's all.
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute.
But I...
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.
Where did you get that dress?
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.
I thought you would go back to New York, like Sam and Angie and the rest of them.
I worked there a couple of vacations, but I don't know.
I guess I was homesick.
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?
Yes, and my family and...
Everything.
Would you like to sit down?
All right, for a minute.
I still can't understand it, though.
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
No. I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
What's that?
Some joke, huh?
Well...
I see it still smells like pine needles around here.
Thank you.
And dance by the
What's the matter?
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well...
Nice about your brother Harry and Ruth, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.
Oh, just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No. Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.
Mary! Mary!
Who's down there with you?
It's George Bailey, Mother.
George Bailey? What's he want?
I don't know.
What do you want?
Me? Not a thing.
I just came in to get warm.
He's making violent love to me, Mother.
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either!
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.
I don't know why I came here in the first place.
- Good night.
- Good night!
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.
I'll get it.
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?
Mary, he's waiting.
Hello?
Forgot my hat.
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.
You mean old mossback George?
Yes, old mossback George.
Hee-haw! Put him on.
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot.
He does so. He asked for him.
George, Sam wants to speak to you.
Hi, Sam.
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?
What do you mean?
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.
Here... Here's Mary.
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.
Tell Mary to get on the extension.
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!
We can both hear. Come here.
We're listening, Sam.
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up that's gonna make us all rich.
George, do you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you'd read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea, and he's gonna build a factory outside of Rochester.
How do you like that?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?
You remember that old tool and machinery works?
You tell your father he can get that for a song.
And all the labor he wants, too.
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him.
Hey, that sounds great.
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.
Now listen. Have you got any money?
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.
Well, now, listen.
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, do you hear?
And, George, I may have a job for you, that is unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan.
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
Oh, Mary. Mary?
I'm here.
Would you tell that guy
I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, do you hear?
The chance of a lifetime!
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any plastics, and I don't want any ground floors.
And I don't want to get married, ever, to anyone.
You understand that?
I want to do what I want to do.
And you're... And you're...
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Mary...
Here they come! Here they come!
Goodbye, George!
Goodbye!
First Harry, now George.
Annie, we're just two old maids now.
You speak for yourself, Miss B.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.
Bert the cop sent this over.
He said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles.
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?
Where are we going? Look at this.
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music and the prettiest wife.
That does it! Then what?
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?
That does it, come here. Come here.
Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George.
I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.
George, let's not stop. Let's go!
Just a minute, dear.
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?
Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George.
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.
Look out, you.
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?
There are a lot of seats over there.
Just make yourselves at home.
George, can I see you a minute?
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?
How does a thing like this ever start?
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors.
I... I...
The whole town's gone crazy.
Yeah, hello?
George, it's Potter.
Hello?
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
Is that true?
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?
Police? What for?
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.
George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis.
I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
He just took over the bank.
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too.
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
Well, you're gonna miss this one.
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen.
George, was it a nice wedding?
Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yeah.
You can take this one off now.
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared.
I have some news for you, folks.
I was just talking to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.
The bank's gonna reopen next week.
But, George, I got my money here.
Did he guarantee this place?
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.
Then, I'll take mine now.
No, but you're...
You're thinking of this place all wrong, as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.
And in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin's house and 100 others.
Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can.
Now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them?
I got $242 in here, and $242 isn't going to break anybody.
Okay, Tom. All right.
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.
Sixty days?
Now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.
Well, I did.
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you've got.
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!
Well, what do you say?
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.
Now, give us 60 days on this.
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
Better to get half than nothing.
Tom! Tom!
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.
If Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan, there'll never be another decent house built in this town.
He's already got charge of the bank.
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?
Well, have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last year when things weren't going so well and you couldn't make your payments.
Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?
You think Potter would've let you keep it?
Can't you understand what's happening here?
Don't you see what's happening?
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.
He's picking up some bargain.
Now we can get through this thing all right.
We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money.
How am going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.
I can't feed my kids on faith.
How much do you need?
Hey! I got $2,000.
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
Tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens.
I'll take $242.
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.
Your account's still here. That's a loan.
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.
Now, Ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? What do you need?
Well, I suppose $20.
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?
But it's your own money, George.
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?
Bless your heart. Of course you can have it. You got 50 cents?
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.
...five, four, three, two, one, bingo!
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!
Get some glasses, Tilly.
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleons here.
We'll save them for seed. A toast.
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar, and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business, you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens.
Close the door.
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab.
George, there's a call for you.
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.
Huh? Come home? What home?
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week?
You got any romance in you?
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places, places George wants to go.
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.
What are they, ducks?
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.
Hiya... Good evening, sir.
Entree, Monsieur.
Entree.
~ Islands of Hawaii ~
~ Where skies of blue are calling me ~
~ Where balmy air and golden moonlight ~
~ caress the waving palms of Waikiki ~
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.
Well, I'll be ...
Mary, where did you ...
~ I Love You Truly ~
~ Truly, Dear ~
~ Life with It's Shadows ~
Oh, Mary ...
~ Life with It's Tears ~
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house?
~ Fade into Dreams ~
This is what I wished for.
~ When I Feel You Are Near ~
Darling, you're wonderful.
~ I Love You Truly ~
~ Truly, Dear ~
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?
I own the house.
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.
No more we live like a pigs in this Potter's Field.
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.
I feel like a queen.
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!
All in!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
All in?
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.
Good old George, he's always making a speech.
Hee-haw!
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.
Bread. That this house may never know hunger.
Salt. That life may always have flavor.
And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever.
Enter the Martini castle.
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.
I'm just your little rent collector.
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.
Look at it.
Congressman Black is here to see you, sir.
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen houses stuck here and there.
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.
Look at it today.
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw,
90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you.
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.
Oh, they are, are they?
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.
Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.
As I say, it's no skin off my nose, but one of these days this bright young man is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're gonna drive on down to Florida.
Why don't you have your friends join us?
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.
Well, I guess we better run along.
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.
Thank you, sir.
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?
I'll send you a box.
Well, I...
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
George, I am an old man, and most people hate me.
But I don't like them, either, so that makes it all even.
You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan.
You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it.
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.
You have been stopping me.
In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
Take during the Depression, for instance.
You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.
Now let's look at your side.
Young man, 27-28, married, making, say, $40 a week.
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, $10, if you skimp.
A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the $10.
Now, if this young man of 28 was a common, ordinary yokel,
I'd say he was doing fine.
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man, who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do.
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
A young man... The smartest one of the crowd, mind you.
A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped.
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters.
Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.
George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
$20,000 a year?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe.
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I?
You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?
You know, this is me.
You remember me?
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.
Yeah, George Bailey, whose ship has just come in.
Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.
Holy mackerel.
Well, how about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success?
I'm offering you a three-years contract at $20,000 a year, starting today.
Is it a deal, or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I...
I know I ought to jump at the chance but I... I just...
I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure.
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'd like to do that.
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?
Okay, Mr. Potter.
No. No. No, no, now wait a minute, here.
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!
You sit around here, and you spin your little webs, and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.
In the whole vast configuration of things,
I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
You...
And that goes for you, too!
And it goes for you, too!
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year, maybe Europe once in a while.
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you.
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight
And
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
To keep from being an old maid.
You could have married Sam Wainwright and anybody else in town.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town.
I want my baby to look like you.
You didn't even have a honeymoon.
I promised you...
- Your what?
- My baby.
Your... Your...
Mary, you on the nest?
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.
Then she had another one, a girl.
Day after day she worked away, remaking the old Granville house into a home.
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.
Potter was bearing down hard.
Then came a war.
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the USO.
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes.
Potter became head of the draft board.
One-A.
One-A.
One-A.
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.
Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France.
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.
Harry...
Harry Bailey topped them all.
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes, two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
- Yes, but George.
- George?
Four-F on account of his ear,
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!
Don't you know there's a war on?
Air raid warden.
Paper drives.
Scrap drives.
Rubber drives.
Like everybody else on VE Day, he wept and prayed.
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, sir.
This morning, day before Christmas, about 10:00 a.m.
Bedford Falls time...
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.
It's gonna snow again.
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.
Commander Harry Bailey!
Mr. Gower, look at this, the second page.
Now, look, this is for you.
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.
Be sure you spell the name right.
Extra! Read all about it!
George, George! It's Harry now on long-distance from Washington.
Harry! What do you know about that!
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.
Harry!
You old seven times a son of a gun. Congratulations.
How's Mother standing it? She did?
What do you know?
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.
Wait till Martha hears about this.
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?
Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.
Oh, they are?
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home this afternoon.
In a plane?
What? Uncle Billy?
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.
- George. George, George.
- What?
- That man is here again.
- What man?
Bank examiner.
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?
I'll be right back.
- Well...
- Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.
My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Although I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges on personal long-distance calls.
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.
I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.
December 24.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal."
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter?
How does slacker George feel about that?
Very jealous. Very jealous.
He only lost three buttons off his vest.
Of course, slacker George would've gotten two of these medals if he had gone.
- Bad ear.
- Yes.
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?
- You forgot something.
- What?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Oh, sure, sure I am.
Well, then, it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.
How about that finger there?
Well, I...
Bailey.
Take me back there. Hurry up.
Come on, look sharp.
Take me back.
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.
Oh, hello, Vi.
George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.
You know, your nephew, remember? Harry.
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.
I ought to have my head examined.
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.
Here you are.
Character?
If I had any character, I'd...
It takes a lot of character to leave your hometown and start all over again.
No, George, don't.
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do, hock your furs and that hat?
You want to walk to New York?
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there, just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.
That's my business, Building and Loan.
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.
Now, let's hear from you once in a while.
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?
Yeah, he's in his office.
What's going on?
The bank examiner's here.
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...
What's the matter with you?
Come here.
Eustace.
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.
Now, look, did you buy anything?
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
- Right. This way.
- Come on.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yeah, maybe, maybe.
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look, do you realize what's going to happen if we don't find it?
Listen to me.
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house?
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?
I've gone over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked since I lost Laura.
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?
It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!
That's what it means.
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.
Hello, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.
How do you like it?
- Bless you!
- Bless you!
Did you bring the wreath?
Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
What wreath?
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.
No. I left it at the office.
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.
Way up at the top. There. That's it.
All right, fill in that little bare spot right there. Right there.
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.
Bet I had 50 calls today about the parade, the banquet.
Your mother's so excited. She...
Must she keep playing that?
I have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy.
Mama said we could stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.
Can you sing, Daddy?
Better hurry and shave.
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.
I don't want the families over here.
Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.
Another big red-letter day for the Baileys.
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car. You should see it.
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?
Yes, Daddy.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.
All right, darling, you're excused.
Now, go on upstairs and see if little Zuzu wants anything.
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.
Caught it coming home from school.
They gave her a flower for a prize, and she didn't want to crush it, so she didn't button up her coat.
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.
He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.
Of course, it's this old house.
I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.
Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...
Hi, Daddy!
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?
I want to give my flower a drink.
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.
I'll give it a drink.
Now, here.
Look, Daddy!
Paste it!
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.
Now, we'll paste this together here.
There. There it is. Good as new.
Now, give the flower a drink.
Now, will you do something for me?
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
It will?
- Telephone!
- Telephone!
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.
The doctor said that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.
Let me speak to her.
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.
Say, what kind of a teacher are you, anyway?
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you?
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids.
And maybe they don't have any decent clothes...
That stupid...
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...
Hello? Hello.
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?
Hello! Who's this?
Oh, Mr. Welch?
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.
Give me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.
George, stop it.
Will you get out and let me handle this?
Hello? Hello? What?
Oh, you will, huh?
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you think you're man enough, you...
Hello! Any...
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!
I'm sorry, Mary.
Janie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.
I'm sorry.
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.
What's the matter with everybody?
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!
Oh, Daddy!
George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...
Mary...
Bedford 247, please.
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.
Hello? Uncle Billy?
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.
I need help.
Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts.
The bank examiner got there today.
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
- The reporters?
- Yes.
They called me up from your Building and Loan.
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.
He's looking for you.
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?
Can't you see what it means to my family?
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest, if you still want the Building and Loan...
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.
What've you been doing, George?
Playing the market with the company's money?
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.
Is it a woman, then?
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
What?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.
You're the only one in town that can help me.
I've suddenly become quite important.
What kind of security would I have, George?
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?
I have some life insurance, a $15,000 policy.
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars?
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.
You were going to go out and conquer the world.
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?
A miserable little clerk, crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.
Nothing but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.
You're worth more dead than alive.
Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000?
You know why?
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.
But I tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.
Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan,
I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.
All right, George, go ahead.
You can't hide in a little town like this.
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!
How about some of that good spaghetti?
We got everything.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Dear Father in Heaven,
I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
I'm at the end of my rope. I...
Show me the way, O God.
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?
Why you drink so much, my friend?
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.
Bailey? Which Bailey?
This is Mr. George Bailey.
The next time you talk to my wife like that, you'll get worse!
She cried for an hour!
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write,
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.
That's what I get for praying.
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?
Yes, you bet.
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.
Oh, no, please, don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.
Please no go away, please!
What do you think you're doing?
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!
Hey, you! Hey, you!
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear.
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.
I passed away in it.
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.
How did you happen to fall in?
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.
You what? To save me?
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.
It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.
I knew if I were drowning, you'd try to save me.
You see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
Very funny.
Your lip's bleeding, George.
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.
That's why I was sent down here.
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
No.
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.
Oddbody?
AS2? What's that, AS2?
Angel Second Class.
Cheerio, my good man.
Oh, brother.
Gee whiz.
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks.
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?
Why'd you want to save me?
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money, $8,000.
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get.
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.
I don't know whether I'd like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Sure, sure.
- How?
- By letting me help you.
Yes. Only one way you can help me.
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.
My wife and my kids and my friends.
I mean, look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...
Oh, shut up, will you?
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.
I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.
All right.
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.
You don't have to make all that fuss about it!
What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.
No worries, no obligations, no $8,000 to get, no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.
I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid.
Must have been that jump in that cold water.
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.
What do you know about that?
What's happening?
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?
What's happened here?
What I need is a couple of good stiff drinks.
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...
The clothes are dry.
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.
What's the matter?
Well, this is where I left my car, and it isn't here.
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.
I guess somebody moved it.
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.
I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?
This tree. Here, I ran into it.
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
Pottersville?
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.
It isn't me.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's.
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.
Clarence. Clarence.
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you, and quick, huh?
Okay.
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.
It's been so long since I...
Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
That's a good man.
I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch.
No, it's not cold enough for that, not nearly cold enough.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
Hey, look, mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast.
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.
Is that clear, or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
What's he talking about?
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.
- He's okay.
- Okay.
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, little fellow, you worry me, you know.
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.
You don't, huh?
- Well, you got any money?
- No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Yeah, they believe in them.
Oh, why should they be surprised when they see one?
Oh, he never grew up. He's...
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three, next May.
That does it. Out, you two pixies!
Go through the door or out the window.
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.
Where do you come off calling me Nick?
Well, Nick, that's your name.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.
Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?
Mr. Gower.
Mr. Gower.
What... What did...
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.
- Don't you know me?
- No.
No.
Throw him out. Throw him out.
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.
That rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid.
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.
Would you show these gentlemen to the door?
Sure. This way, gentlemen.
Stay out.
Get me! I'm giving out wings!
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the capsules.
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...
Hey, what's going on around here?
What...
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.
Look, who are you?
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?
No. Of course not.
Well, then, why am I seeing all these strange things here?
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.
There is no George Bailey.
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.
They're not there, either.
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.
You've been given a great gift, George, a chance to see what the world would be like without you.
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.
So long, mister. I'm going home.
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.
I'm going home and see my wife and family.
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.
How am I doing, Joseph?
Thanks.
No, I didn't have a drink.
Hey, hey, where did the Building and Loan move to?
Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
That sailor's a liar!
I know every big shot in this town!
I know Potter, and I'll have you kicked off the beat.
Hey, Violet!
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.
- I know.
- I know that girl!
Take a walk. Beat it.
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.
Where do you live?
Now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- Come on.
- All right. All right.
Come on, Ernie, now straighten me out here.
Look, I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field, my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid, and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for 20 years.
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.
Mary. Mary!
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?
They're not here, George.
You have no children.
Where are they?
What have you done with them?
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.
Come on out here, both of you.
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?
You were here on my wedding night.
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid, and we'll take you in to a doctor?
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...
Run, George! Run, George! Run!
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.
I need a drink.
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.
Well?
Mother.
Mother? What do you want?
Mother, this is George.
I thought sure you'd remember me.
George who?
If you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.
Please let me come in, and keep me here until I get over it.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.
It's a lie.
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Strange, isn't it?
Each man's life touches so many other lives.
And when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
I've heard of things like this.
You got me in some kind of a spell or something.
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.
I know how, too. I...
The last man I talked to, before all this stuff started happening to me, was Martini.
You know where he lives?
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.
Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
Every man on that transport died.
Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me, where is she?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?
She's an old maid. She never married.
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?
She's just about to close up the library!
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?
I don't know you. Let me go!
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.
Help me, Mary!
Mary! Let me go!
Help! It's a wild man!
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!
Tom! Ed! Charlie!
That's my wife!
- Mary!
- No, you don't.
Somebody call the police.
Somebody hit him on the head with a bottle.
You need a straightjacket.
Clarence!
Get out of here!
Clarence!
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!
Stand back!
Clarence!
Clarence!
Clarence! Clarence!
Help me, Clarence!
Get me back!
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.
Get me back to my wife and kids.
Help me, Clarence, please.
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.
Hey, George!
George!
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?
Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!
What the sam hill are you yelling for, George?
You...
George? Bert, do you know me?
Know you? You kidding?
I've been looking all over town trying to find you.
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe you...
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?
What did...
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!
Bert! What do you know about that?
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.
Mary! Mary!
Hello, Bedford Falls!
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, George.
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, emporium!
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
Happy New Year to you in jail!
Go on home. They're waiting for you.
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.
George, I've got a little paper here.
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful, old drafty house.
Mary! Mary!
Mary.
Have you seen my wife?
Merry Christmas, Daddy.
Kids! Pete!
Kids! Janie!
Janie! Tommy!
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.
Where's your mother?
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!
George, darling. Where have you been?
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?
George, George.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You've no idea what happened...
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.
- They're on their way.
- All right.
Come on.
Come on in here now.
Now, you stand right over here by the tree.
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?
I hear them coming now.
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.
- What's happening?
- What's happening?
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.
George.
Here's everything right here.
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!
She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money.
Didn't ask any questions.
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.
...another run on the bank?
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.
The line forms on the right.
More coming, George.
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.
Martini! Step right up here.
I busted the jukebox, too.
Oh, Mr. Gower!
I made the rounds of my charge accounts.
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.
Violet Bick.
Oh, Annie! Annie!
I've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever I get a husband.
Merry Christmas.
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.
Here's something for you to play with.
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.
Now, get this, it's from London.
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.
"My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

Harry. Harry.
Looks like I got here too late.
Mary, I got him here from the airport just as quick as I could.
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.
Good idea, Ernie. A toast to my big brother, George, the richest man in town!

Most of these incidents are so incredible that one would almost have to be there in order to believe them.
You know, many people believe that we archeologists are just a collection of old fogies digging around in ruins after old dried-up skulls and bones.
Particularly medical men like yourself.
Isn't that so, John?
I wouldn't say that, Dad.
Not everybody thinks that way.
Oh, I could go on telling you stories like this all day long.
Personally, I think you're boring Isobel and her mother.
Who cares what happened 3,000 years ago?
Being my sister doesn't give you the right to be disrespectful.
- I'll have you...
- Now, now.
Are you two children going to start that feud all over again?
Oh, I just get annoyed.
So does everybody else.
Am I boring you, Mrs. Evans?
Oh, not at all. I find it most interesting.
And you, Isobel?
Oh, I should say not.
Please tell us the rest.
Hmm.
All right.
Well, we started out from Cairo to search for Ananka's tomb.
We weren't a particularly adventuresome-looking group.
There was Babe Hanson, an old friend of mine, a Brooklyn magician named Solvani and his daughter, Marta.
And, oh, yes, Dr. Petrie of the Cairo Museum.
We traveled for a long, long time through the desert,
then up into the mountains.
Babe! Babe, where are you?
- Wow!
- What happened? You all right?
I don't know. I started to hook the wire to the detonator to set off the dynamite and here I am.
Effendi! Effendi!
This is an unholy tomb.
It's the seal of the Seven Jackals.
What we've been searching for.
They mustn't touch it, effendi.
There's a curse upon it.
Oh, bosh.
It means death to whoever breaks that seal.
We can't stop now for a lot of silly native superstitions.
I have waited a long time for this moment.
The native workers fled, screaming something about there being a curse on the place.
However, it didn't turn out to be Ananka's tomb at all.
Easy. It's heavy. Watch out.
That's good. Look.
Whoa!
Why, it isn't sealed.
Let's take it off.
Careful, now. Careful.
That isn't Princess Ananka. It's a man.
And in the finest state of preservation of any mummy I've ever seen.
Later on, we found the most amazing thing about this mummy.
Doctor.
What do these lines in his face mean?
There's only one answer. He was buried alive.
He must have struggled desperately against those bandages.
What a terrible way to die.
Probably for some sacrilege.
Possibly. Have you touched his face?
- What?
- Go ahead. Touch it.
Feels like living tissue.
Exactly.
How true that proved to be.
Because, astounding as it may seem,
Kharis had never really died.
We learned afterward that Kharis was being kept alive by a strange race of high priests.
Only one of these high priests remained, a man by the name of Andoheb.
He and a servant kept constant watch
on our movements from up above in the mountains.
Very interesting, aren't they, Dr. Petrie?
Professor Andoheb.
Where did you come from?
The important thing,
Doctor, is that I'm here.
Then you knew about this tomb, and yet you insisted the vase was an imitation.
There are some things in science which should be brought to light.
And there are others, Doctor, which should be left alone.
You mean, we never should have come into this cave?
Since you are here, I think it's fitting that you should learn exactly what you've stumbled upon.
Come.
For a scientist, you are very unobserving, Dr. Petrie.
Why, there's a pulse beat.
Why, this is absurd. It's... It's fantastic.
In this vial, I have the fluid from nine tana leaves.
Nine tana leaves, Dr. Petrie.
That wouldn't mean anything to you, but watch.
Now, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's... It's beating faster.
He's alive.
Let me go!
Get off! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
The mummy. Somebody swiped it.
Who could've done that?
- I can't understand it.
- Steve, Petrie!
What could've happened?
I don't know, Babe.
He's dead.
Go on and get some sleep, Marta.
We'll get a start as soon as it's light.
- Steve.
- Yes?
I wish you'd give all this up and come back to the States with us.
Well, I can't promise you that, but I will be back sometime.
Do you mind if I say
I think you're a swell person?
Hmm?
Well, after that, things happened pretty fast.
The next victim was my native overseer, Ali.
The same fashion as the doctor.
Marta went to bed that night.
We were all pretty jittery and...
Marta!
Babe.
When we got there, they'd disappeared.
Obviously, there was some sort of secret passageway.
I remained to search for it and Babe looked around outside.
The mummy, apparently, had broken an urn in passing.
And I examined the fragments and found a clue.
There was a secret passageway.
Steve!
Marta, what happened? How did you get here?
The mummy brought me here. He's alive.
Yes, I know.
Pop. Is he all right?
He's all right. Just a little shaken up.
Meanwhile, outside of the temple...
See here, you Egyptian Mickey Finn.
I'll give you three to tell me where she is. I'm not kiddin'.
We've gotta get you out of here in a hurry.
He's after tana fluid.
That's what must be in this vial.
And in the urn, Steve!
It's full of the fluid.
You mustn't let him get it.
Keep him away from it!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Well, I got Marta back safely, all right.
Brought back the body of the Princess Ananka, too.
But I've always regretted I wasn't able to bring back the mummy with her.
You can well imagine what a contribution to science that would have been.
The monster was really alive, walking and breathing?
Absolutely.
It's beyond the imagination.
The most amazing thing I've ever heard.
Why, it's like hearing from a world beyond.
That's the way it happened, and if Marta were alive today she'd tell you the same thing.
Nobody that ever went through an experience like that could ever forget it.
Well, at least I have the satisfaction of having destroyed a terrible monster, and in doing so, rid the world of an awful curse.
Thirty years ago, an infidel sought to destroy me and to destroy Kharis.
Both attempts failed.
The bullet he fired into me only crushed my arm.
The fire that sought to consume Kharis only seared and twisted and maimed.
Open it.
Kharis still lives...
Lives for the moment he will carry death and destruction to all those who dared violate the tomb of Ananka.
That moment has now arrived.
Once each night, during the cycle of the full moon, you will dissolve three tana leaves and give the liquid to Kharis.
Three leaves will keep him alive.
Nine leaves will give him motivation.
And now I leave in your hands the curse of Amon-Ra and the destiny of Kharis.
Preparations are complete to the last detail.
A position as caretaker of the little cemetery at Mapleton has been arranged.
Now swear by the sacred gods of Egypt that you will never rest until the last remaining member of the Banning family is destroyed.
Until they all have suffered the fate of those who dared to defile the tomb of our royal dead.
Swear that you will never betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world, and by the dread horror of Set,
I shall never forsake my trust as a high priest of Karnak.
And now, O mighty gods of Egypt, may you find in this young follower a successor worthy in every respect to carry on the sacred trust now delivered into his hands.
And save him from any temptation that might destroy him.
As it nearly destroyed me.
The ways of my people are strange to Western minds, but it is my duty to offer prayers each night, so that the soul of my dear one is not left alone to wander lonely and forgotten through the spaces of time.
Certainly. Anything we can do to...
No, there is nothing.
It is simply that not a single word may be uttered in the presence of Occidentals.
Very good, sir. You can count on me, sir.
I shall see that you're not disturbed, sir.
Thank you.
We are on our way, Kharis.
Now nothing shall stand between us and the fulfillment of our vows.
Nothing, Kharis. Nothing.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
- You the new caretaker?
- Yes, effendi.
They wired me and said you'd be here.
I expected a much older man.
It's very peaceful here. I think I like it.
But it's such a lonely existence.
It seems strange to me that a young fellow like you would want to tie himself down to the job of a caretaker.
You see, there is a difference in our philosophies.
Here I continue close to the one
I admired and loved in life.
Have it your own way. I'm not complaining.
You understand what you have to do here.
- Yes, I understand thoroughly.
- All right.
I'll be getting along. Good-bye.
Bye, effendi.
Three tana leaves to keep him alive, nine to give him movement.
Kharis.
Kharis.
Kharis.
The moon rides high in the sky again, Kharis.
There is death in the night air.
Your work begins.
What was that?
I don't know.
Let's go home. I'm scared.
Vic. Vic.
Mmm? What's the matter?
There's something outside.
I seen it go by the window.
Seen what?
I don't know, but its shadow crossed my face.
- Ain't nothin' out there.
- I seen it, I tell ya.
I'm gonna phone the Sheriff right now.
Hello. Sheriff speaking. What do you want?
A shadow? You wake me up for that?
Go on back to bed. You must be crazy.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the matter with you? Quiet down!
You're kind of cramped for space, aren't you, son?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Well, here goes.
You know, that's just perfect.
Even if you didn't ask me, as a checker player, I'd say you're a darn good doctor.
Three games in a row ought to prove something.
Yeah.
Yeah, it proves it's 11:00.
Ooh, I'd better be getting on home.
And I'd better be getting to bed.
You should've been there an hour ago.
That's what you get for having an older sister.
Now, Stephen, don't you start talking about ages.
- What's the matter with them?
- I'll run out and see.
- You go to bed, Dad.
- All right, son.
I'll be back in a minute,
Isobel, to take you home.
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Isobel.
- Good night.
King! Silver! Quiet, boys!
What's the trouble with the dogs, Jim?
They don't bark like that for nothing, Mr. John.
Something must have frightened them mighty bad.
Kharis!
Why, that... That sounds like Stephen.
Wait here.
He...
He's dead.
One is gone, Kharis.
One who dared defy our ancient gods.
Three remain... Only three.
And then we can return to the land that gave us birth.
Ah, this is just a waste of time.
Those marks left on his throat were nothing but dust.
You're the coroner and you should know.
Still, it might lead to some clue.
It's worth checking on.
I've tried to compare this with specimens of clay and dirt from all over this territory.
Seems to be nothing like it around here.
This is just another one of those fiend murders.
What reason would anyone have for doing such a thing?
You can't call it a fiend murder and let it go at that.
I don't intend to, John.
We'll do everything we can.
- Just let us handle it.
- All right, Sheriff.
Go on.
Well, you see, we were...
We were parked along the west county pike and...
What time was that?
Well, it must've been a little before 11:00.
We were listening to Jan Garber on the radio.
That's right. Then all of a sudden, a shadow passed over us.
What sort of a shadow?
Well, I don't know. Just a shadow.
Didn't you see what made it?
No, sir. We didn't look up right at once.
And when we did look, it was gone.
- All right, you can go.
- Yes, sir.
I'll send for you if I need you again.
- Vic.
- Yeah.
You called me about seeing the same sort of shadow.
I seen it. It passed right over my bed.
I seen somebody pass by the window, too.
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.
The moon was behind him.
He just kind of looked all black.
Anything else?
When we looked out, whoever it was, was gone.
Okay, Vic, I'll see you later.
I've covered a lot of murders, this is the first time I ever had a shadow for a suspect.
Might as well let the reporters in.
Yeah? What are you gonna tell them?
I don't know. Maybe they can give me a lead.
Okay.
Oh, John, are you still at this desk?
I've checked through every person that ever contacted him.
I still can't find anyone who would have reason to...
Look, John, you can't spend the rest of your life doing detective work.
All right, Auntie.
You're the boss around here.
What would you have me do?
Stop neglecting your practice.
Go down to your office and...
My dear, since this thing's happened, you've forgotten her completely.
I guess you're right, Auntie.
Of course I'm right.
You go on out there. Spend the day with her.
It'll do you both some good.
All right.
It's wonderful being with you again, darling.
Aunt Jane told me you'd called, but since that night
I've had so much on my mind.
Oh, I understand, John.
O mighty gods of Egypt, may you keep up my strength to carry out the mission entrusted to me.
Strength to resist any temptation which may be thrown across my path.
Strength to fulfill the destiny of Kharis.
I was wondering when he'd get here.
When does the train arrive?
Around 11:00, I think.
I'll run down and meet him.
You needn't wait up.
Oh. I certainly shall wait up.
Babe was always one of my favorites.
Suit yourself, Auntie.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Now go, while the moon is still high in the sky.
Death goes with you.
Am I glad to see you, Babe.
I came as fast as I could, John.
How's Jane?
Oh, fine, considering.
Come on, get in. We can talk on the way home.
Very well.
That's everything we know.
Haven't been able to find a motive or reason or anything.
- Not a clue nor nothing?
- No.
Oh, yes, yes, there was something, but nothing came of it.
What was that?
A kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Must've been a powerful hand that strangled him.
What did you say?
Kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Clay or dust or something.
Grayish mark.
A grayish mark.
Quiet, King. Quiet, Silver.
Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
You are back, Kharis.
Now you can rest.
Rest until the moon is high again in the sky.
Two are dead and two remain.
It's no use. Hemiplegia.
Take a look.
It's a form of paralysis caused by severe shock.
Jim. Jim.
Don't you know me?
Can't you remember anything?
If there's any change, will you please call me?
I will, John.
All right, Babe.
Hey, look who's here!
Hi, boys, how are you?
Hi, Lefty, Joe. Hi, Peoples.
Well, Frank, don't tell me they sent you out on this assignment.
Yep. Had my choice of covering the Russian front or this.
I picked this.
Look, John, your father has told this story over and over.
Sure. When I was a kid.
He used to tell me fairy tales, too.
Yes, but this is different, and you know it.
Thirty years ago, your father and I met up with this curse in Ananka's tomb.
It wasn't imagination either.
We saw that curse bring on death.
We thought we'd destroyed the mummy in the fire.
Maybe it escaped, or maybe there was another one.
Oh, Babe, it's ridiculous.
Even supposing you were right, what would it be doing around here?
Where would it hide?
If those high priests could keep a man alive for 3,000 years, they certainly could figure out the rest, too.
Oh, Babe, listen...
The only clue we have are the dust marks on Dad's throat, and now on the throats of Aunt Jane and Jim.
It's not dust. It was mold that came from a mummy.
All right, Babe. Have it your way.
We can't go on arguing all night.
- John, will you do me a favor?
- Certainly.
Leave Mapleton. Go as far away as you can, as quickly as you can.
Why would I do a thing like that?
Because you're next in line.
The curse on that tomb extends to the blood relations of all the men that entered it.
- Then you're included.
- Suppose I am.
I'm an old man. You're...
Now, Babe, I've known you ever since I could walk.
I'd do anything in the world for you.
But I'm a doctor.
I can't believe in a live mummy.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find someone that will listen to me.
Someone that will listen to me before it's too late for all of us.
There was a gray mark on the throats of every single person killed in this town.
I know that.
And that mark wasn't mud and it wasn't clay.
It was mold.
We'll look into it, Mr. Hanson.
And we certainly appreciate your coming in like this to tell us about it.
Don't you believe me?
Well, now, you see...
Yes, I know.
You're a doctor, too, like John Banning.
A heart and lungs couldn't last
3,000 years. Go on, tell me that.
As a matter fact, I was just about to say those very words.
All right, don't believe me.
And don't do anything about it.
Wait till more murders are committed.
Look, Mr. Hanson, there are dozens of reporters here from all the metropolitan papers.
A number of them are razzing Mapleton about the revival of witchcraft.
I know that.
What would they say if I was to tell them that a mummy, 3,000 years old, was doing all the killing?
They'd laugh us out of office.
What will they say when they find out that I was right?
And that I tried to tip you off?
Give me a beer, will you?
Yes, sir. Coming right up.
Excuse me. Aren't you Babe Hanson?
- That's right.
- I'm Jake Lovell, New York Record.
How are you?
Suppose you're down here because of all the trouble.
Maybe.
Too bad about Mr. Banning and his sister, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Any idea what's behind everything?
I know what's behind it.
- You know what?
- I know all about it.
Only nobody will listen to me.
Look, friend, if you're after a listener, you don't need to look any further.
Now, what's this all about?
Well, it started 30 years ago when Steve
Banning and I discovered Ananka's tomb.
- Yeah, what's that got to do with it?
- Everything to do with it.
That tomb was guarded by a live mummy.
We saw it. We fought it.
You mean to say...
You think a mummy's been doing all these murders around here?
I know it was a mummy.
What a yarn.
It's gonna be a tough baby to sell my editor.
Give me all the details.
Well, at that time
Steve and I were young men.
Steve was interested in archeology.
I know. I know. I've heard that laughingstock routine before.
Now what do you want me to do?
Sure, the whole town's afraid of their own shadows.
I'm following up on it. Good-bye.
Sheriff!
It's out again. I just saw that shadow.
I saw it with my own eyes.
You saw a shadow. What else did you see?
- I didn't wait for anything more.
- That's fine. That's a great help.
Well, you don't think for a minute
I was taking any chances?
- Where did you see it?
- I was walking along High Street...
Come on. We're going back to High Street.
I've written hundreds of news stories, but never in my life...
The killer! He's out again!
He just frightened Nick Landsford down on High Street.
The Sheriff and he are down there now!
Thanks, Babe. See you later.
Kharis!
He's dead.
Look.
What is it?
I'm not sure, but I think
I know someone who can tell me.
Darling, will you drive me to the university?
- I want to see Professor Norman.
- Of course.
I'll call him and tell him we're coming.
Be out in a minute.
All right.
This powder, which you say was scraped from the gray marks on the victims' throats, is mold.
- Mold?
- Yes, mold.
Developed through so many centuries that it's almost impossible to calculate.
Hmm...
It's the same we find in this strip of linen.
What makes you so sure?
Well, in the first place, there's a distinct scent common to both of them. Smell it.
It's undoubtedly the odor of myrrh.
Comes from a tree known as the Commiphora abyssinica, which grows only in parts of Africa.
So?
This reddish brown resin is myrrh.
The other test tubes contain cedar oil and sodium carbonate.
Now, all those substances come from this strip of linen.
Look.
You can see that mark where the linen has been partially eaten away?
Yes, yes, I know. But what's it all about?
Where does it come from?
That mold and this strip of linen both came from the body of a mummy.
The chemicals were used for embalming.
There's no doubt about it.
That inky hieroglyphic there is the same that's found on the body of the Princess Ananka.
It dates back almost about 3,000 years, to the reign of King Amenophis, her father.
But...
Whether you are ready to accept it or not, we are dealing with the presence of the Living Dead.
Then Babe was right, and we wouldn't listen to him.
Well, now you've seen the evidence.
We've got to accept it.
Living or dead, I'm going after it, whatever it is, now that I know what to look for.
Come on.
- Telegram for Mr. Banning.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
The commission's just what I wanted.
But coming at a time like this...
I think it's wonderful.
Just what you've needed, something to get you away from here.
Nobody else could reason with you.
But there's one thing certain.
You know the army won't wait.
Three days. Hardly gives me time to get my affairs settled.
If you have any things that need attending to, I can take care of them.
- You?
- Sure.
You didn't think for one minute I'd leave without taking you with me, did you?
Well, you've just proposed and answered yes all in one breath.
Oh, Isobel, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I...
Now, don't go spoiling it by saying any more.
We'd better get started.
I have a million things to do.
Wedding preparations and all that.
John, maybe we'd just better go down to the judge's office in the morning.
Oh, no, we'll have it at home, in memory of Dad.
He'd have wanted it that way.
All right, John.
Kharis.
Kharis, come here.
They think there will be a marriage and an heir to carry on the blood of the Bannings.
They think that, Kharis.
This time, Kharis, I'm sending you upon a different mission.
One of life rather than of death.
You are eternal, Kharis.
Earthly pains and sickness cannot touch you.
Like the age-old hills of Egypt, you exist, you are.
The ancient line of the high priests of Karnak must minister unto you until the end of time, Kharis.
I shall do that for you, Kharis, I.
I am going to take on to myself a wife, Kharis.
A wife. Do you understand that?
The one...
The one who is supposed to be the bride of the last of the Bannings.
The one whom it was ordained I should find.
Turn around, dear.
Mmm-hmm.
There, I think that's it.
What do you think, Ella?
Oh, she looks beautiful.
How fast they grow up, though.
Are you sure you can have it ready for tomorrow?
Oh, heavens, yes! There isn't much to do.
A dart here and there, shorten the sleeves.
You're about the same size your mother was when she was married in this dress.
- Am I, Mother?
- Mmm-hmm.
Who knows?
Maybe someday I may be making this dress over for another young bride.
- Oh, you never can tell.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night, Laura.
Together we three, until the world crumbles and there is no longer a stone or a rock, or a tree or a blade of grass.
That is my will, Kharis, and you shall obey it.
Bring her here.
Go!
Go.
You've been happy, haven't you, Mother?
We'll talk about that later.
It's time now you were in bed.
Vic. Vic!
There's that sound again. I'm scared.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.
All right now, men. I've asked you to meet me at the Banning home because we've got a terrible job on our hands.
And it's gonna require every bit of courage we've got to see it through.
Whether you can believe it or not, the facts are here, and we've got to face them.
A creature that's been alive for over 3,000 years is in this town, and it's brought death with it.
We've got to run it down.
Thirty years ago, my father discovered and violated a sacred tomb in Egypt.
Did I hear you say something about Egypt?
That's right.
I've been out to the graveyard, Sheriff, and I was talking to the caretaker about a final resting place for myself.
Yes?
And the caretaker spoke all about Egypt and quoted a lot of passages from his Egyptian Bible.
Then when I heard you talk here tonight,
I thought maybe he knows something about it.
John! John!
Oh, John! John! Isobel!
The monster took her away!
- Isobel?
- Yes.
John, give out those clubs.
Give out the torches.
Come on, men, get your torches.
Where am I? What are you doing?
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing will hurt you ever again.
That creature.
Kharis? You have nothing to fear from him.
He has brought you here to me because it is your destiny to achieve the greatest honor that can come to a woman.
You will become the bride of a high priest of Karnak.
No. No!
For you, I'm going to forsake the teachings that have been handed down to us for generations upon end.
The secret that has kept Kharis alive all these years can be ours as well.
You're mad.
After I have given you the tana fluid you will be immortal, even as Kharis is immortal.
What I can do for you, I can do for myself.
You will bear me a son, and he will be brought up in the confines of the tombs of Egypt, even as I was brought up.
A new priest of Karnak who will carry on the ancient and honorable line.
No.
John and I, tomorrow, we're going to be married.
There will be no marriage between you and John Banning.
The sins of his father are upon his head, and only death waits for him, as it has for the rest of his family.
For he who despoils the ancient tombs of Egypt must die.
One day you will thank me for this.
Over here.
Kharis.
Take her out and hide her until I get rid of these fools.
Let's go in!
Open that door! Open that door!
Come on!
Open up! Open up in there!
Get something to break this door down!
Quiet! Quiet, men!
There's the man we're after.
- You gentlemen wish to see me?
- Yes.
You've some explaining to do.
What have you done with Isobel?
With whom?
Up to now, I've only asked questions.
Do I have to use another method to make you speak up?
Well?
I know nothing of any such person, effendi.
The mummy. Isobel. Through the woods.
- Banning!
- Well?
For those who defile the temples of ancient Egypt, a violent death shall be their fate.
Come on, men, let's go.
Over there!
If the mummy tries to get away, stop him with fire.
Watch the back stairs.
Don't let him get away.
Isobel. Isobel!
John.
I'm so glad we managed to sneak out while the folks are celebrating.
Hey!
They were heard screaming at each other for 2 hours. Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.
A crime of passion.
Yeah.
Just look at all the passion on that wall.
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.
Did the kid see it?
What?
The kid?
What kind of question's that?
We'll be real glad when we get rid of you, Somerset. Always these questions.
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?
He's dead.
His wife killed him.
Anything else has nothing to do with us.
Detective Somerset?
I'm Detective Mills.
Just get in town 20 minutes ago, they dump me here.
Look...
Mills?
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.
Not much time for this transition thing.
I had a question, when we spoke on the phone.
Yeah.
Why here?
I don't follow.
Well, all this effort to get transferred.
It's the first question that popped into my head.
Same reason as you. Or the reason you had before you decided to quit.
You just met me.
Maybe I don't understand the question.
It's very simple.
You actually fought to get reassigned here.
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.
It'd be great if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls.
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.
- Not here.
- I understand.
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective, do me the favor of remembering that.
SE7EN
MONDAY
MONDAY
Yeah.
Okay.
Say it again?
I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls.
Serpico's got to go.
Well, you might want to get rid of this little... crusty, this eye, Serpico.
- Did you get it?
- Got it.
Good.
Coffee?
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.
What time was death established?
Like I said...
I didn't touch anything... but he's had his face in spaghetti for 45 minutes.
Wait. No one bothers with vital signs?
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.
I wonder.
What was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Don't know. How many times Barney Five found dead bodies that weren't dead.
Drop it.
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.
Better Homes and Gardens.
Spaghetti Sauce
Who said this was murder?
No one.
Guy's heart must be the size... of a canned ham.
If this isn't a coronary... well...
I don't know.
Whoops.
How about that.
We had this case once... guy dead on the ground... knife in his back.
Murder... right?
Fuck!
Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah? So the guy... took the tip of the blade... stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.
Wait a minute.
What?
Got a bucket here.
What's in it?
Oh God!
Fucking vomit.
Any blood in it?
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.
Are you thinking it's poison?
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
Think it's poison, Somerset?
You girls have got forensics waiting outside.
We might not fit.
There's room. Light's the problem.
How are you?
Det. Mills, go help the officers... question the neighbors.
What?
And send in forensics.
He's dead.
Thank you, Doctor.
You saw my files, the things I've done?
Nope.
I did door-to-doors and walked the beat. I did that shit... a long time.
- And?
- My badge says...
"detective".
That's the same as yours.
Look, I made a decision.
I had to consider the integrity of the scene... not whether you were getting enough time on the field.
Hey, man...
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.
He's been dead... a long time, and not from poison.
Oh, man.
How can you let yourself go like that?
It took 4 orderlies just to get him on the table.
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.
Look. See how big this stomach is?
And the strange thing is, it stretches.
Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food...
I see that, but it means nothing to me.
Okay, he's got lines of distention... across the duodenum.
The interior wall's ripped open.
This man ate till he burst?
He didn't really burst. Not all the way. He was hemorrhaging internally.
There was a hematoma in the rectus and...
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?
Yes and no.
What about these bruises here?
I haven't figured that out yet.
Gun pressed against his head?
Pressed hard enough.
Fuck, yeah.
On the front, flush with the muzzle.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide.
Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving. Took his time too.
Coroner said it could have lasted more than 12 hours.
Victim's throat was swollen, probably from the effort... and there was a point when he passed out.
That's when the killer kicked him...
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.
When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot.
You don't risk the time it takes to do this...
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy and tortured him. Simple as that.
In the grocery bags... we found 2 receipts. So, the killer stopped and went back... to the supermarket.
So?
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.
- This is beginning.
- We've got... one dead guy, not three.
No motive.
Don't start that big brain of yours... cooking on this, alright?
I'd like to be reassigned.
Whoa.
What are you talking about?
This can't be my last duty.
It'll go on and on.
You're retiring in 6 days.
You've left unfinished business before.
Those cases were taken as close to conclusion as possible.
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.
It's his first assignment.
I knew it. This is not my first assignment, you dick.
It's too soon.
I'm here. You can say that shit to my face. Captain?
It's too soon for you.
Captain...
Can we talk in private?
This is a personal thing--
Just shut up, Mills.
I don't have anyone else... to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.
Give it to me.
I'll put you on something else.
Go on, Mills, just go on.
I'm sorry, old buddy, but it looks like you're stuck... cleaning up the fat man.
TUESDAY
TUESDAY
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED
Quiet down.
Alright, calm down. Calm down.
Quiet down.
Here's how it'll work:
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes and 10 minutes only.
Ask those questions in a calm, sane, orderly fashion or I will leave.
Detective? Detective?
- Can I have a moment?
- No.
I won't discuss the details of this investigation, so don't bother asking.
What you got for me?
Nothing yet, boss.
Why don't you guys go get a coffee, huh?
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...
Eli Gould was found murdered today.
District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters.
That's ridiculous and offensive.
There is no conflict, and any claim there could be is irresponsible.
Now hold on.
I just met with law enforcement officials and they... assured me that they have their very best men on this.
This will be the very definition... of swift justice.
GREED
Pardon me, George.
Somerset.
Come in.
You heard the news?
Nope, haven't heard.
Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.
Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death.
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.
Mills is heading the investigation.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Don't do that, please?
Good for him.
What will you do... with yourself out there, Somerset?
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel that feeling?
You're not going to be a cop anymore.
That's the whole idea.
I don't think you'll leave.
Hell, you can't leave all this.
Guy's out walking his dog.
Gets attacked.
His watch is taken, his wallet.
And while he's lying... on the sidewalk helpless... his attacker stabs him in both eyes.
This happened last night about 4 blocks from here.
I read about it.
I don't understand anymore.
It's the way it's always been.
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.
I don't think you can deny that.
Maybe I'm wrong.
The coroner sent this down for you.
Found them in the fat boy's stomach... mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.
They were... fed to him.
Lord.
GLUTTONY
This was found behind the refrigerator in the obesity murder scene.
"Long is the way
And hard, that out of hell leads up to light."
It's from Milton.
"Paradise Lost."
Alright...
I'm confused.
It means that this is beginning.
GLUTTONY
This was behind the same refrigerator... written in grease.
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.
Gluttony... greed... sloth, wrath... pride, lust... and envy.
Seven.
Hold on.
This is not even my desk.
You can expect five more of these.
Wait a minute.
I can't get involved in this.
Somerset.
He wanted it.
Damn!
I'm all over it.
Where to?
Far away from here.
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.
Sit where you'd like.
How's everybody?
Hiya, Smiley.
George, the cards are getting cold.
Duty calls.
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...
I'll never understand.
All these books... a world of knowledge right here... and what do you do?
You play poker all night.
Hey, we got culture.
Yeah, we got culture coming out of our asses.
How's this for culture?
CHAUCER

I just might.

WEDNESDAY
Fucking Dante.
Goddamn poetry-writing fagot piece of shit.
Fucker.
Good work, Officer.
Thank you, Lord.
Oh, oh, sorry.
I'll move in a second.
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.
Yeah?
Phone.
Package deal.
Comes with the office.
Mills.
Honey...
You okay? Something wrong?
You dingleberry, I told you not to call me here when I'm working.
Yeah. Why?
Why?
Okay.
It's my wife.
Sorry?
She'd like to speak to you.
This is Detective Somerset.
Well, yes, it's nice to talk to you too.
I appreciate the offer, but...
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
Yes, thank you very much.
Bye.
Honey, what...?
Well?
Sorry?
I'm invited to late supper at your apartment. I accepted.
At my... How's that?
Tonight.
Hello, men.
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.
That's Tracy. Tracy...
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Except your first name.
It's William.
Well, it's a good name...
William.
William, I'd like you to meet David.
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.
Aw, good dogs.
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?
Smells good.
Yeah, I mean, thank you.
Please have a seat, if you like.
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.
We're still unpacking.
I hear you were high school sweethearts.
Pretty hokey, huh?
You know something?
On our first date I knew he was...
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?
He was the funniest guy I ever met.
Really.
It's kind of rare nowadays.
I mean, that level of... commitment.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No matter... how often I see guns,
I just can't... get used to them.
Same here.
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.
What the hell?
I was close once.
It just didn't happen.
It surprises me.
It really does.
Well...
Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable.
Just ask your husband.
Very true.
Very, very true.
How long have you lived here?
Too long.
How do you like it?
You know... takes time. Settle in... it'll be good.
Well, you get numb after awhile
There are things to any city...
Subway.
It'll go away in a minute.
This real estate guy.
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.
Then I start wondering why he'll only bring us here 5 minutes at a time.
We found out the first night.
The soothing, relaxing... vibrating home, huh?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.
I don't know why you're laughing.
Alright, already.
He had to get into the building... before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer in town.
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left, then had... his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday, maybe Monday.
Look.
Gould was bound, right arm free.
He was handed a butcher's knife.
Check out the scale.
A pound of flesh.
"One pound of flesh"
"No more no less
No cartilage...
No bone.... only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."
Didn't see it.
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".
I tell you that chair was...
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.
The killer wanted Gould to take his time... deciding which cut.... to make first.
Imagine it.
There's a gun in your face.
Which part of your body is expendable?
The love handle.
Cut along the side of his own stomach.
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...
Look through it.
Edit out your initial shock.
The trick is to find one item, one detail and focus on it... until it's an exhausted possibility.
I'll get another beer. Beer?
Wine, please.
He's preaching.
Punishing.
The sins were used in medieval sermons.
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?
Yeah.
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill and check out all the sinners?
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.
But there pride comes first, not gluttony.
For now let's consider... the books as the killer's inspiration.
The sermons were about atonement for sin.
These murders are like forced attrition.
Forced what?
Attrition's when you regret your sins, but not because...
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.
No fingerprints.
Nope.
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.
And no witnesses of any kind.
Which I don't get... because the fucker had to get back out.
In any major city, minding your own business is a science.
In rape prevention, the first thing they teach you is never cry for help.
Always yell, "Fire!".
Nobody answers help.
Holler "fire," they'll come.
That's fucked up.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
You know what? Thank you for talking this out, but I must sleep.
Walk the dogs.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.
Gould's wife. She was out of town at the time.
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.
What if it isn't what she has seen... but what she's supposed to see but hasn't had the chance?
Yeah, okay. What?
I don't know.
But that's the one thing.
I'll sign us in.
Must see Mrs. Gould.
Mrs. Gould?
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.
I don't understand.
I need you to look at each photo... very carefully.
Look and see if there's anything strange or... out of place, anything at all.
I don't see anything.
Please, I can't do this right now.
Okay.
It's got to be now.
There may be something we missed.
Wait.
What?
Here.
This painting, it's upside down.
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.
Those shots were taken before forensics.
Nothing.
There's got to be something.
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.
What the fuck is that?
Switchblade.
Goddamn it.
There must be something.
He didn't paint the fucking thing.
No, he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing.
See this, this is us.
Just wait a minute.
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.
You're kidding me.
Call the print lab.
Oh, man.
Honestly... have you ever seen anything like this?
HELP ME
The swell pattern tells me that they're not... the victim's fingerprints.
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.
It doesn't fit.
He doesn't want to stop.
Who knows.
Freaks out there doing their evil deeds they don't want to do.
"The voices made me do it".
"Jodie Foster made me do it".
It can take...
3 days to make a match, so maybe you guys want to cross... your fingers somewhere else.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?
About catching this guy.
Wish I still thought the way you did.
Tell me what the hell it is you think we're doing?
Picking up the pieces.
We're collecting all the evidence, taking all the pictures and samples... writing everything down... noting the time things happened.
That's all?
That's all.
Putting everything into neat piles and filing it away... on the off chance it'll be needed in the courtroom.
Picking up diamonds on a deserted island... saving them in case we get rescued.
Bullshit.
Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others.
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight.
I saw you.
We're getting somewhere.
THURSDAY
THURSDAY
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
We got a winner.
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.
Homicide found his prints at the scene.
He's got a long history of serious mental illnesses.
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.
Somewhere along the line they fell short.
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault, spent time... in prison for the attempted rape of a minor.
His lawyer made sure that didn't last long. By the way... the lawyer was Eli Gould, the "greed" victim.
We'll stop this today, ladies and germs.
Victor's been out of circulation for awhile, but we've a residence for him.
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...
Like our guy, does it?
You tell me.
Our killer seems to have more purpose.
You ever take a bullet?
Never in my thirty-four years, knock on wood.
I've only taken my gun out...
3 times wanting to use it.
Never pulled the trigger.
Not once.
You?
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet, but...
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.
We were a secondary unit.
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.
We bust open the door looking for this junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.
One cop got hit in the arm.
Christ, what was his name?
It spun him like a top... no, Well, more, you know, more like slow motion.
I remember... riding in that ambulance... and, well... he died right there.
Right there.
Christ, what was his fucking name?
SWAT goes before dicks.
They love this.
Police!
Clear!
Good morning, sweetheart.
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!
Get up, you sack of shit.
Oh, fuck me.
Dicks!
You'll want to come take a look at this.
Dicks!
Jesus.
Victor?
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?
Hearse, I'd say.
Call for forensics.
Get your people out.
No one touches anything.
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.
Sloth.
Aw, man.
Goddamn.
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.
This must be the first.
Look.
It's dated exactly one year ago today.
I got a hair sample. I got a... stool sample. I got piss. I got... fingernails.
He's laughing at us.
You got what you deserved.
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!
Guns down!
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.
We must forget our emotion.
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.
I got a fucking right to be here.
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.
I got your picture, man.
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.
Detective Mills.
M-I-L-L-S. Fuck off.
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!
How they get here so fucking quick?
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.
Hey man, I'm sorry.
They piss me off.
It's okay.
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.
1 year of immobility's right, judging by the muscle and spine deterioration.
Blood tests show a smorgasbord of drugs in his system.
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep the bedsores from infecting.
Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way?
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed off his tongue long ago.
Doc.
Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive?
He'd die of shock right now if you shone a flashlight in his eyes.
He's had as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered, give or take and he still has hell to look forward to.
Good night.
Hello, William.
It's Tracy.
Tracy?
Everything okay?
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.
Where's David?
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.
I'm sorry to call you like this.
Oh, it's all right.
What can I do for you?
I need someone to talk... to. Do you think you could meet me... somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?
I don't understand.
I feel stupid calling, but... you're the only person that I know here.
There's no one else.
If you can... just give me a call, okay?
I have to go now.
Good night.
Good night.
FRIDAY
FRIDAY
I mean... you know this city so well.
You've been here... so long.
It can be a hard place.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Why don't you talk to him about it?
Tell him how you feel.
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.
Especially now.
I'll get used to things... you know?
I wanted to talk to someone... who's lived here for a long time.
I mean, upstate, it's a completely different environment.
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade? Well, I did.
Yeah, he mentioned it.
I've been going around, looking at schools... but the conditions here are... horrible.
What about private schools?
I don't know.
Tell me what's really bothering you.
David and I are going to have a baby.
Oh, Tracy. I...
I don't think I'm the one... to talk to...
- about this.
- I hate this city.
I had a relationship once... it was very much like a marriage.
We got pregnant.
This was a long time ago.
I remember getting up one morning and going to work.
Just a day like any other, except it was the first day after I knew... about the pregnancy.
And I felt this fear... the first time ever.
I remember thinking... how can I bring a child into a world like this?
How can a person grow up with all this around them?
I told her I didn't want to have it.
And over the next few weeks...
I wore her down.
I want to have children.
I can tell you now that...
I know... I mean...
I'm positive that...
I made the right decision.
But not a day passes that I don't wish... that I had made a different choice.
If you don't... keep... the baby, I mean, if that's your decision... don't ever tell him you were pregnant. but if you choose to have the baby... then spoil that kid... every chance you get.
That's... about... all the advice I can give you, Tracy.
I must go.
William.
Thank you.
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust
Victor's landlord said there was cash in the mail box... the first of every month.
Quote:
"I never heard a single complaint from the tenant... in apartment 306, and nobody ever complained about him.
The best tenant I've ever had."
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
I'm sick of this waiting.
This is the job.
Why aren't we out there?
Why must we sit here rotting, waiting till the lunatic... does it again?-
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.
Come on, he's insane. Look.
Right now he's probably dancing around in his grandma's panties.
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.
How's that?
I don't think so.
His luck'll run out.
He's not depending on luck.
We walked in there exactly 1 year after he tied Victor to the bed.
One year to the day.
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.
Oh, yes, we do.
This note he left... his first words to us.
"Long is the way, and Hard, that out of hell...
Leads up to Light."
Fuck him. So what?
He's right, so far.
Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year.
To sever his hand and to use it... to plant fingerprints.
To insert tubes into his genitals.
This guy's methodical, exacting... and worst of all, patient.
He's a nut bag.
Because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
You got money?
I got 50. Fifty bucks.
I propose a field trip. Come on.
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating to the 7 deadly sins.
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.
What would he study to do the things he's done?
What are his interests now?
Jack the Ripper, for instance.
- Where are we going?
- Library.
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--
Discount coupons.
They must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection.
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking... we're dating.
Give me your money.
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.
Somerset. How you doing?
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.
It's not a problem. Sit down.
Only for you do I do this, so it's a big risk.
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.
About an hour.
Yep. Help yourself.
That was money well spent.
Yeah.
Alright.
Telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Good, 'cause I might punch you.
It's probably nothing, but even so, it's no skin off our teeth.
The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau.
Who, stinky man?
For years, the FBI's been hooked into the library system, keeping records.
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.
Look.
Certain books are flagged.
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...
"Mein Kampf".
Anyone who checks out a flagged book has his library records fed to the FBI.
Wait. How is this legal?
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.
You can't use the information directly. It's just a useful guide.
It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card without an ID... and a current phone bill. See?
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.
If you want to know who's reading...
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost" and "Helter Skelter"... the FBI's computers will tell us.
It could give us a name.
Of a college kid writing a term paper... on 20th-century crime.
At least you're out of the office.
Get a haircut.
How do you know this?
I don't.
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.
"Divine Comedy".
"History of Catholicism" A book called "Murderers and Madmen".
"Modern Homicide Investigation".
"In Cold Blood".
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?
It's not what you think.
The Marquis de Sade.
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
Is that it?
Yep.
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?
Whatever.
We're sure about that name, are we?
You were, you saw it. John Doe.
You want to go back, I'll go back.
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.
This is crazy.
We'll just talk to him.
"Excuse me, sir. Do you happen to be a serial killer?"
You do the talking.
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
You've talked to my wife?
Retarded.
Charlie's fucking Angels.
A name off a computer.
Mills.
- You hit?
- No.
He's going down!
Fifth floor!
Police. Is there a back way out?
Lock your door.
Get out of the fucking hall, please.
Get down!
Get the fuck down.
Goddamn it.
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.
Where are you going?
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.
What? He fucking shot at us.
You can't go in.
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.
Think about it. Think how did we get here?
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.
Just pay attention a minute?
With a hole like this, we won't be able to prosecute.
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.
We need a reason to knock on this door.
Think about it.
Okay?
Okay, okay.
You're right. I'm all fucked up.
When you're right, you're right.
Well... no point in arguing anymore.
Unless you can fix that..
You stupid son of a ...
How much money we got left?
So, yeah, I noticed... this guy going out a lot... when the murders were happening, so I...
So you called Det. Somerset?
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy... was creepy and shit, and one of the murders...
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.
Got everything?
Have her sign. You must sign.
Good.
You did good.
- I did what you said.
- Here.
You get something to eat.
Everybody stay outside.
Victor.
Wild Bill's Leather
Fuck.
LUST
Somerset!
- What?
- We had him.
What are you saying?
The fucking photographer in... the fucking stairs.
We had him and we let him go.
You're sure this is him?
Yep. Good. Get it out.
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?
We got his money. I like it.
Wait. You won't believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.
We could use some more men.
I'm doing my best.
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here... and each notebook contains about 250 pages.
What about the killings?
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are, what a gross stage we dance on.
What fun, dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.
We are not what was intended."
Wait, there's a lot more.
"On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.
He made small talk, a lonely man talking about the weather and things.
I tried to be pleasant... but my head began to hurt from his banality.
I almost didn't notice... but I suddenly threw up all over him.
He was not pleased... and I couldn't stop laughing".
No dates.
Placed on the shelves in no discernible order.
Just his mind poured out on paper.
Looks like a life's work.
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts, it'd still...
- take 2 months.
- I know.
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?
People, quiet!
I admire you.
I don't know how you found me, but I was surprised!
I respect you law enforcement officers more every day.
Well, I appreciate that, John.
- I tell you--
- No, listen:
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule in light of today's setback.
I just had to call and express my admiration. Sorry I had to hurt... one of you, but I had no choice, right?
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to say more but that'd ruin the surprise.
Got it.
Everybody back to work.
You were right.
He's preaching.
These murders are his sermons to us.
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.
Who's the blonde?
Looks like a pro.
Maybe.
She caught John Doe's eye.
Wild Bills' Leather
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?
- Yeah.
- This man?
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.
One sweet piece, actually.
I thought he was a performance artist.
You know the sort of guy that... pisses in a cup on stage and then... drinks it.
Performance art.
Right.
I think I undercharged him.
- You made this for him?
- I've made... weirder shit than that.
They found the blonde.
The picture!
The picture!
Fucking pigs.
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...
Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.
Come on, this way.
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.
You from homicide?
You better see this.
Get this thing off me.
Oh God, get it off of me.
Get him out of here, now!
I want to hear it again.
Tell me again.
You heard nothing strange, saw nothing strange.
He asked me if I was married.
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?
The what? What?
The prostitute. Where was she?
Someone comes to your establishment... they want to go downstairs, get some oo-la-la. Whatever.
They got to come to you. Yeah?
Yeah.
You didn't see anyone?
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?
Everybody that comes in there's got to be a package under their arms.
Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff.
She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down? You or him?
Do you like what you do for a living?
All these things you see?
No, I don't.
But that's life, isn't it?
He had a gun. And... he made it happen.
He made me do it.
He put that thing on me.
And he made me wear it.
Then he... told me to fuck her.
And I did. I fucked her.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.
The fucking gun was in my throat.
Fuck.
Oh, God. God.
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.
This won't have a happy ending.
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.
If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil... if he's Satan himself... that might meet our expectations.
But he's not the devil.
He's just a man.
You know...
You bitch and you complain and you tell me these things.
If you think you're preparing me for hard time... thanks, but...
But you got to be a hero.
You want to be a champion.
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?
I want to know.
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.
Go on.
I don't think I can continue to live in a place... that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.
You aren't different or better.
I didn't say I was. I'm not.
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.
Apathy is a solution.
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life.
It's easier to steal what you want than to earn it. It's easier... to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.
No, we're talking about everyday life here.
You can't afford to be this naive.
Fuck off.
See, you...
You should listen to yourself.
Yeah. You say that... the problem is people don't care.
So, I don't care about people.
Nonsense. You know why?
You care?
Want to know-- Damn right.
You'll make a difference.
Whatever. The point is that... you're not quitting because you believe... these things you say.
You want to believe them... because you're quitting.
And you want me to agree with you and say "You're right, it's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess. We should all go live in a fucking log cabin."
But I won't.
I won't say that.
I don't agree with you. I do not.
I can't.
I'm going home.
Thank you, though.
I love you.
So much.
I know.
SUNDAY
SUNDAY
What's your emergency?
Could you repeat that?
I've done it again.
PRIDE
What have we got?
Sleeping pills.
Glued to one hand.
Telephone glued to the other.
You see what he did?
He sliced her up.
Then he bandaged her.
Call for help and you'll live.
But you'll be disfigured.
Or put yourself out of your own misery.
Come on.
He cut off her nose.
To spite her face.
And he did it very recently.
Listen...
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe... or he'll kill 7 and this case will never end.
Don't do me any favors. Thank you, but I got it.
I'm asking to be your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me a favor.
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.
Detective?
After this I'm gone.
- No big surprise.
- Detective!
You're looking for me.
Don't fucking move.
On the floor.
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.
I know you.
Now. Get down.
Get down on your stomach.
You piece of shit. Now!
All the way. All the way... fucker. Down.
Faster.
Faster, fucker. Now.
Nose on the ground.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.
Goddamn it.
He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers. That's why we couldn't... find 1 print in his apartment.
Seems he's done that for a while.
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?
So far everything is a dead end.
No credit history.
No employment records.
A 5-year old bank account opened with cash.
We've tried tracing his furniture.
All we know about him... is that he's independently wealthy... well-educated... and totally insane.
Because he's John Doe by choice.
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.
There he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.
He's not finished.
He's pissing in our faces and we're taking it.
You know what I'm saying.
For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement.
He wouldn't just stop.
So what the fuck, man?
He's 2 murders away from completing his masterpiece.
We'll wait for his plea.
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them... and only at 6 o'clock today.
Why us?
He says he admires you.
It's part of the game.
If they don't accept this offer, these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.
We've got him.
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
He'll get his free room and board, cable TV.
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit... and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.
I don't like it.
The law requires me to serve... my clients and their interests as best I can.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
My client informs you that... if you do not accept, he'll plead insanity.
Let him try it.
I'd like to see it.
We know with the extreme nature of these crimes I'd get him off... with such a plea.
I won't let this conviction slide.
If you do accept under his specific conditions, he'll sign... a full confession, plead guilty right now.
It's your case.
Make a decision.
Full confession.
I'm in.
It must be both of you.
If he were to claim insanity... this conversation is admissible.
That he's blackmailing us with his plea.
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.
The press'd love to find out the police weren't concerned... about finding and burying them.
If in fact there are 2 more dead.
The lab report came.
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.
They found blood from Doe's fingers, blood from... the woman who's face he cut off, and blood from... a third party... as yet unidentified.
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
Let's finish it.
If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO flies out...
I want you to expect it.
I will.
If I accidentally shaved off a nipple, would it be covered by workman's comp?
I suppose so.
If you were man enough to file a claim...
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
I keep coming home late, my wife'll think something's up.
You know...
Yeah.
What?
Will this wind hurt us?
Who are you, John?
Who are you really?
What do you mean?
At this stage, what harm can it do to tell us about yourself?
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.
Stay on your left up here.
Where are we heading?
You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?
That wouldn't be shocking enough.
You've got newspapers to think about, yeah?
Wanting people to listen... you can't just... tap them on the shoulder anymore.
You have to use a sledgehammer.
Then you'll get their strict attention.
But the question is:
Why're you so special that people should listen?
I'm not special.
I've never been exceptional.
This is, though. What I'm doing.
My work.
Your work, John?
Yes.
See, I don't see anything special about it, John.
That's not true.
No, it is true. And the funny thing is, all this work... in 2 months, no one'll care, or give a shit, or even remember.
You can't see the whole complete act yet.
But when this is done... when it's finished... it's going to be...
People will barely be able to comprehend.
But they won't be able to deny.
Could the freak be more vague?
As far as master plans go...
I really can't wait for you to see.
It's going to be something.
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.
So when this thing happens, be sure and let me know.
Don't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry.
You won't.
You won't miss a thing.
What's so exciting?
It's not too far now.
I've tried to figure something in my head. Maybe you can help me out.
When a person is insane, as you clearly are, do you know... that you're insane?
Maybe you're reading... masturbating in your own feces...
Do you just stop and go:
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?
You know? Do you guys do that?
It's more comfortable for you to label me insane.
It's very comfortable.
It's not something I would expect you to accept.
But I did not choose. I was chosen.
Whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that. but it seems that you're... overlooking a contradiction.
Meaning what?
Glad you asked.
If you were chosen... that is, by a higher... power... and if your hand was forced... it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment.
You enjoyed torturing those people.
That doesn't seem to fit with martyrdom, does it?
John?
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me... in a room without windows.
Isn't that true?
How'd you like to...
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.
I would never.
You wouldn't only because there's consequences.
It's in those eyes of yours, though.
Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.
I won't deny my own personal desire... to turn each sin against the sinner.
Wait a minute, I thought all you did was kill innocent people.
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?
An obese man.
Disgusting man who could barely stand.
You'd point him out to your friends so that they'd join you in mocking him.
If you saw him while you ate, you couldn't finish your meal.
Then the lawyer. You had to secretly thank me for that.
This is a man who dedicated his life... to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep... murderers and rapists...
- on the streets.
- Murderers?
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman... so ugly inside that she couldn't go on living... if she couldn't be beautiful outside?
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget... the disease-spreading whore.
Only in a world this shitty... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face.
But that's the point.
We see a deadly sin on every street corner... in every home and we... tolerate it.
We tolerate it because it's common.
It's trivial.
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.
Well, not anymore.
I'm setting the example.
And what I've done will be... puzzled over... and studied... and followed... forever.
Yeah.
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
Why's that, John?
Because you'll be remembered after this.
Realize, Detective, the only reason that I'm here now... is that I wanted to be.
No. We would have got you eventually.
Oh, really?
So what were you doing, biding your time? Toying with me?
Allowing 5 "innocent" people to die until... you felt like springing your trap?
What was the indisputable... evidence you were going to use on me, right before...
I walked up to you and put my hands in the air?
John. Calm down.
I remember us knocking on your door.
That's right.
And I seem to remember breaking your face.
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Okay. Sit back.
- I spared you.
- Sit back.
Remember that when you look in the mirror... for the rest of your life... or should I say for the rest of what life I allow you... to have.
Sit back, you fucking freak!
Shut your fucking mouth!
You're no messiah. You're a movie of the week. A fucking tee shirt... at best.
Don't ask me to pity those people.
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.
Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Do you see those high-tension towers?
That's where we're headed.
I see it. 9 o'clock, and follow that road.
There sure as shit is no ambush out here.
No fucking nothing out here.
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.
I want you to go way up.
In thirty seconds, bank east on my mark. Thirty seconds.
I'll get him.
Get out.
Slowly.
Stop.
Stay.
What do you got?
A dead dog.
I didn't do that.
What time is it?
Why?
I'd like to know.
It's close.
Let's go take a look.
It's this way.
Down. Down. Down.
Watch him.
There he goes.
It's good we have some time to talk.
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.
A van's coming down the road.
From the north.
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.
Get out!
Out!
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.
Step away.
Turn around. Hands on your head.
What's going on?
Why are you here?
I'm delivering a package for this guy, David.
Detective...
David Mills.
Get it. Slowly.
A guy paid me $500 to bring it out here.
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.
Put it down.
We got a box.
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.
Bomb squad. We got a box.
Face the van.
Hands up.
Turn.
Okay. Go.
Off you go. Go.
I'm sending the driver out on foot.
He's headed north, along the road.
Have him picked up.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm going to open it.
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.
It's blood.
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
California, stay away from here.
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.
Whatever you hear, stay away.
John Doe has the upper hand.
Here he comes.
- Throw your gun down!
- What?
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Do you hear me, Detective?
I'm trying to tell you how much...
I admire you and your pretty wife.
What?
Tracy.
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing... how easily a member of the press can purchase... information from the men in your precinct.
What the fuck?
Throw your gun down!
I visited your home this morning... after you left.
I tried to play husband.
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.
Throw it away!
It didn't work out.
So...
I took a souvenir.
Her pretty head.
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.
What's goin' on over there?
Would you... Put the gun down.
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?
Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.
It seems that envy is my sin.
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the fucking box?
He just told you.
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.
She's all right. You tell me.
Become... wrath.
Tell me she's all right!
If you murder a suspect, David... you just throw it all away and he knows it.
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!
She begged for her life... and for the life of the baby inside of her.
He didn't know.
Give me the gun, David.
If you kill him... he will win.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Well, we'll take care of him.
Whatever he needs.
Where you gonna be?
Around.
I'll be around.
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:
The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."
I agree with the second part.
Are you here to kill me?
I know what this is.
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
A man possessed of some radical notions.
What is the most resilient parasite?
A bacteria? A virus?
An intestinal worm?
Uh....
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--
An idea.
Resilient. Highly contagious.
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.
Right in there somewhere.
For someone like you to steal?
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...
...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...
...from even the most skilled extractor.
How can you do that?
Because I am the most skilled extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...
...your defense is never down.
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
...better than your therapist, better than anyone.
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...
...I need to know what's in that safe.
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.
He knows.
What's going on up there?
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
What's she doing here?
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.
If I jumped, would I survive?
With a clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?
I thought you might be missing me.
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.
So what?
Looks like Arthur's taste.
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.
Please, have a seat.
Tell me...
...do the children miss me?
You can't imagine.
What are you doing?
Just getting some fresh air.
Stay where you are, Mal.
Goddamn it.
Turn around.
The gun, Dom.
Please.
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?
I want to know the name of your employer.
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him would just wake him up.
But pain....
Pain is in the mind.
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
He was close. Very close.
Stop him!
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
He won't wake.
What?
Dunk him.
He's out.
You came prepared, hmm?
Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
- She would never....
- Yet here we are.
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.
Well, that's not true.
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
But your deception was obvious.
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.
Cobb?
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!
I've always hated this carpet.
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
But very definitely made of wool.
Right now...
...I'm lying on polyester.
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.
- How'd it go?
- Not good.
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.
But in my dream, you play by my rules.
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito....
We're not in your dream.
We're in mine.
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
That's enough.
You. What the hell was all that?
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.
He's not gonna check every compartment.
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.
Listen. Every man for himself.
Yes, hello?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?
Why?
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
Grandma says you're never coming back.
Phillipa, is that you?
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
She's shaking her head.
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.
Daddy?
Yeah, James?
Is Mommy with you?
James, we talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.
Where?
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?
And you be good, you be--
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?
Stateside.
Send my regards.
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
So I offer you the satisfaction.
It's not the way I deal with things.
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...
...why can't you plant one there instead?
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?
Elephants.
Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
Then you do have a choice.
Then I choose to leave, sir.
Tell the crew where you want to go.
Hey, Mr. Cobb.
How would you like to go home?
To America. To your children.
You can't fix that. No one can.
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...
...I'd need a guarantee.
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.
But I can.
So do you want to take a leap of faith...
...or become an old man, filled with regret...
...waiting to die alone?
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.
This can't be done.
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.
You don't know that.
I've done it before.
Who'd you do it to?
Why are we going to Paris?
We're gonna need a new architect.
You never did like your office, did you?
No space to think in that broom cupboard.
Is it safe for you to be here?
Extradition between France and the United States...
...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...
...to convince those children they still have a father.
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.
I never taught you to be a thief.
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.
But after what happened...
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
What are you doing here, Dom?
I think I found a way home.
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
But I need your help.
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.
- Money.
- Not just money.
You remember.
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities...
...things that never existed...
...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
They don't actually come into the dream.
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
Design it yourself.
Mal won't let me.
Come back to reality, Dom.
- Please.
- Reality.
Those kids, your grandchildren...
...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I've got somebody better.
Ariadne?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
Pleased to meet you.
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
A work placement?
Not exactly.
I have a test for you.
You're not gonna tell me anything first?
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
Stop.
Again.
Stop.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
That's more like it.
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
Now, that's when we're awake.
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.
Such as?
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
Genuine inspiration, right?
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.
We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?
It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Let me ask you a question.
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah.
So how did we end up here?
Well, we just came from the, uh....
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
If it's just a dream, then why are you--?
Because it's never just a dream, is it?
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.
That's why the military developed dream sharing.
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other...
...and then wake up.
How did architects become involved?
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Five minutes?
What--? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...
...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.
Almost everything else is here too.
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.
I am the subject. My mind populates it.
You can literally talk to my subconscious.
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
How else do you do it?
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
Well....
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
...but it's more about the feel of it.
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
Just you.
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this....
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.
Very impressive.
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?
Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college.
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.
You draw from stuff you know, right?
Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?
That why you need me to build your dreams?
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?
There was still time on the clock.
You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
What?
A totem, it's a small personal--
That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
- Like a coin?
- No.
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
That way, when you look at your totem...
...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to...
...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back....
When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.
It's a necessary risk.
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.
Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.
You never know.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
You're buying.
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.
How's your handwriting?
- It's versatile.
- Good.
Thank you very much.
Inception.
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me--
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
He is good at what he does, right?
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.
Not like you.
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.
You need the simplest version of the idea...
...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
So, what is this idea that you need to plant?
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
Right there you have various political motivations...
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
But all of that stuff, it's, um....
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?
What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
Which is what?
The relationship with the father.
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.
Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf.
He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.
Why don't you take me there?
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.
Cobol Engineering.
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.
All right.
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
My God, it's you, isn't it?
No, it isn't you.
Not dreaming now, are you?
Get him!
There!
One cafe.
Shh.
One cafe.
One cafe.
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.
Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
Different tail.
Cobb said you'd be back.
- I tried not to come, but....
- But there's nothing quite like it.
It's just...
...pure creation.
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
What kind of tricks?
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.
The infinite staircase.
See?
Paradox.
So a closed loop like that...
...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
But how big do these levels have to be?
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.
And the better the maze....
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
Exactly.
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
Why?
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.
- They're still together?
- No.
No, she's dead.
What you see in there is just his projection of her.
What was she like in real life?
She was lovely.
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.
To formulate compounds for a job?
And to go into the field with us.
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.
- Which are?
- Great depth.
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
Three.
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.
A powerful sedative.
- How many team members?
- Five.
Six.
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
This time, it seems there is.
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.
Perhaps you will not want to see.
After you.
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
They come every day to share the dream.
You see? Very stable.
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.
In dream time?
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?
Let's see what you can do.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
Sharp, no?
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
That's not your concern.
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
You asked me for inception.
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
This idea will define him.
It may come to change....
Well, it may come to change everything about him.
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
And we can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
Mr. Browning...
...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?
Not sure that's necessary.
No, no, no. I think we should.
How is he?
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but--
Robert, I told you keep out the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.
Leave that.
Here.
Must be a cherished memory of his.
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.
Robert...
...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.
The vultures are circling.
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
Then, when we take him a level deeper...
...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
So he gives himself the idea.
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
Were you going under on your own?
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
I didn't realize anyone was here, so....
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.
Here, let me take a look.
So you're learning, huh?
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh....
It was Mal's, actually. This....
This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin.
Arthur told me she passed away.
How are the mazes coming along?
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
...that we are trying to access.
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.
You know, l-- Actually, I have a question about this layout.
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.
Why is that so important?
In case one of us brings in our projections.
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
You can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.
- You can't build...
...because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
No one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.
- Thank you.
- For what?
For not asking whether I did.
"I will split up my father's empire."
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...
...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a "screw you" to the old man.
No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
All right, well, try this. Um....
"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than "might."
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
Inception's not about being specific.
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find.
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father...
...and say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
Sedation.
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
Good night.
The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
...creates a clear connection between dreamers...
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20--
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?
It's a week, the first level down.
Six months the second level down, and the third level--
That's 10 years.
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Depends on the dream.
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
- A kick.
- What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.
It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
That's the clever part.
I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.
Or tipping.
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need--
We need at least a good 10 hours.
Sydney to Los Angeles.
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.
He must be flying private, then.
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
On a 747, the pilot's up top...
...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Of course I do.
You said you had a dream.
That we'd grow old together.
And we can.
You shouldn't be here.
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.
Why do you do this to yourself?
It's the only way I can still dream.
Why is it so important to dream?
In my dreams, we're still together.
These aren't just dreams.
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.
I know I did.
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.
They're memories that I have to change.
Well, what's down there that you regret?
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.
This is your house?
Mine and Mal's, yes.
Where is she?
She's already gone.
That's my son, James.
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
That's Phillipa.
I thought about calling out to them...
...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.
Right now or never, Cobb.
Then I start to panic.
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
...that I need to see their faces one last time.
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
But the moment's past.
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.
As I'm about to call out to them...
...they run away.
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.
The real world.
What are you doing here?
My name is--
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand.
How could you understand?
Do you know what it is to be a lover?
To be half of a whole?
No.
I'll tell you a riddle.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you don't know for sure.
But it doesn't matter.
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
Because you'll be together.
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
What happened here?
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!
I'll come back for you. I promise.
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
All right.
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
And it doesn't have to be me...
...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the plane.
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.
Complete the job en route...
...I make one phone call from the plane...
...you have no trouble getting through lmmigration.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh. Water, please.
Oh, um, same, please.
Um....
Thank you.
You know, I couldn't help but notice...
...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
Yes, he, um....
He was my father.
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Hey.
To your father.
May he rest in peace, huh?
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
Ha, ha, bloody ha.
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.
All right. Taxi. Thank you.
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?
Great.
Come on.
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.
You might at least drop me at my stop.
I'm afraid that it doesn't--
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!
What the hell is going on?
This wasn't in the design.
Cobb?
Cobb?
Get him!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.
Saito?
Get Fischer in the back room now.
What the hell happened?
Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
Where'd it come from?
Why the hell were we ambushed?
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...
...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.
It should've shown in the research.
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!
We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.
Put him out his misery.
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
No. It won't wake him up.
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.
Not from this.
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
Right. So, what happens when we die?
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind...
...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
Which, in our case, is just you.
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.
Let's get him upstairs.
Great.
Thank you.
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.
And if we get killed...
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
Someone got first aid?
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.
This was the only way to go three layers deep.
You knew about this and went along with it?
I trusted him.
When? When he promised you half his share?
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.
You led us into a war zone with no way out?
There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible...
...and we get out using the kick, just like before.
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.
I am sitting this one out on this level.
Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
Downwards is the only way forwards.
Get ready.
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
Shut up! It won't be.
In your father's office, below the bookshelves...
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.
I don't know any safe.
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
Tell us what it is.
I don't know.
We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah? Whose authority?
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?
Cash, cards, lD. And this.
Useful?
Maybe.
You're on. You've got an hour.
An hour?
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.
- What's that?
- Good authority.
Uncle Peter.
Just make them stop.
- The combination.
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
You have one hour. Start talking.
You all right?
You okay?
Those bastards have had at me for two days.
They have someone with access to your father's office.
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.
- Yeah, well, neither do l, so....
- What?
Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it.
No, he never gave me any combination.
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.
Well, what, then?
I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers...
...based on your experiences with Maurice.
We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together.
Perhaps after your mother died.
After my mother died, you know what he told me?
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.
I was 11, Uncle Peter.
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
And if he dies?
Worst-case scenario?
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.
I appreciate that, Saito.
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
Limbo is gonna become your reality.
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
Filled with regret?
Waiting to die alone.
No.
I'll come back.
And we'll be young men together again.
Breathe.
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.
All right. What is in the safe?
Something for you.
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
That's an alternate.
This would supersede the other if you want it to.
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
Destroying my whole inheritance?
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.
In his own way.
In his own way.
At the end...
...he called me in to his deathbed.
He could barely speak.
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
He pulled me close.
And I could only make out...
...one word.
"Disappointed."
When were you in limbo?
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?
The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer...
...we're also going deeper into you.
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
We were working together.
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
I kept pushing things.
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
...that we could get trapped so deep...
...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
...we lost sight of what was real.
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.
We did that for years.
We built our own world.
How long were you stuck there?
Something like 50 years.
Jesus.
How could you stand it?
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.
And what about for her?
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
Limbo became her reality.
What happened when you woke up?
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades...
...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.
This one very simple idea that changed everything.
That our world wasn't real.
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
...that in order to get back home...
...we had to kill ourselves.
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...
...that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.
I can tell the difference.
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?
You don't know you're dreaming!
She was certain there was nothing I could do...
...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.
She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary.
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.
No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me.
No, I'm not.
Now, you listen to me.
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.
Now, just step back inside.
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
We've talked enough.
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.
We're gonna talk about this.
All right?
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.
Take a second, think about our children.
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...
...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
How you've threatened to kill me.
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
We're going home to our real children.
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?
You're waiting for a train.
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!
Jesus Christ!
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
So I ran.
Right now, or never, Cobb.
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!
All right, let's go.
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
And if we are gonna succeed in this...
...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her.
But you don't have to do that alone.
- No, you're not....
- I'm doing it for the others.
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
We have to move.
Time's up.
All right. I don't know any combination.
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
- I have no idea.
- Right now!
I said, right now! Right now!
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
You'll have to do better than that.
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?
What'd you get?
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
This helps us how?
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.
We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
Damn it.
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...
...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.
The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
No problem.
How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?
Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
- You ready?
- Ready!
Sweet dreams.
Am I boring you?
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.
Um, I have a lot on my mind.
There goes Mr. Charles.
Mr. Fischer, right?
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--
Hmm.
- And you must be?
- Leaving.
In case you get bored.
Must've blown you off.
That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.
Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.
Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500--
About $500, right?
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.
Who or what is Mr. Charles?
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
And why don't you approve?
It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.
So now you've noticed how much time...
...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
- I'm sorry, but....
- Hold on! Wait!
You look a bit perkier.
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
Turbulence on the plane?
No, it's much closer.
That's Yusuf's driving.
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?
Rod Green from marketing.
But that's not true at all, is it?
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?
I'm the head of your security down here.
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
Security, huh?
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.
You're talking about dreams?
Are you talking about, um, extraction?
I am here to protect you.
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event...
...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.
Strange weather, isn't it?
You feel that?
What's happening?
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
We should probably get out of here.
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.
None of this is real. You're in a dream.
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself...
...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
Yeah, l....
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
Mm-hm.
- You're not real?
- No.
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event...
...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you get me out of here?
Right away. Follow me.
Hold on a second.
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger...
...you may not wake up.
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.
You remember the training.
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
What do you remember from before this dream?
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.
There was rain.
Uncle Peter.
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.
It had something to do with, um....
Something to do with a safe.
God, why is it so hard to remember?
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
Listen, it takes years of practice.
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.
Five.
Five, two-- It was something, it was a long number.
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.
Yep.
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
So we get a nice synchronized kick.
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.
They're with me. Go on.
Mr. Charles.
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.
They were trying to put you under.
- I'm already under.
- Under again.
What do you mean, a dream within a dream?
Hey. I see you've changed.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.
Oh.
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...
...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
Shh.
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.
And you saw them torture him?
The kidnappers are working for you?
Robert.
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?
That's his last insult.
A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.
But he's wrong.
You can build a better company than he ever did.
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
All right.
- He's out.
- Wait.
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
We're going into Fischer's.
I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
That's right.
Security's gonna run you down hard.
And I will lead them on a merry chase.
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
You good?
Hey. You ready?
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.
Cobb?
Cobb? What's down there?
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.
I mean, what's down there for you?
Did you see that?
Eames, this is your dream.
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.
No, you're with me.
I could do it.
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.
The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
You're not coming in?
In order to find out the truth about your father...
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.
Come on, Fischer!
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!
Move!
Go!
Sod it.
I hope you're ready.
No, it's too soon.
Cobb, do you hear that?
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
So, what do we do?
We move fast.
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
Which gives Arthur three minutes.
- Hey!
- That's him!
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.
Then they need a new route, a more direct route.
It's designed as a labyrinth.
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
Eames?
Did Eames add any features?
I don't think I should tell you.
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
Good. Explain it to them.
- Saito?
- Go ahead.
Paradox.
- What was that?
- The kick.
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?
Yeah, we missed it.
Man.
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, what the hell do we do now?
We finish the job before the next kick.
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up....
How do I drop you without gravity?
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.
You okay?
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!
Go, go, go!
There's something wrong.
They're heading your way, like they know something.
Just buy us more time, all right?
- Come on!
- On my way.
Come on! Move!
All right.
Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
- Does the strong room have windows?
- lt wouldn't be very strong if it did.
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.
I'm in.
There he is.
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
Come on. Come on, a little lower.
Cobb.
No, she is not real.
How do you know that?
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.
Hello.
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.
I couldn't shoot her.
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.
So that's it, then? We failed?
We're done. I'm sorry.
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
Let's set the charges.
No, there's still another way.
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.
No, but there will be enough time down there.
And we will find him.
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him.
We can give him his own kick down below.
Look, you get him in there.
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital...
...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.
Saito will never make it, will he?
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
Mal's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.
She wants me back down there with her.
All right?
- This is your world?
- lt was.
And this is where she'll be.
Come on.
Saito. Saito.
I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?
No room for tourists on these jobs.
Don't be silly.
You built all this? This is incredible.
We built for years.
Then we started in on the memories.
This way.
This was our neighborhood.
Places from our past.
That was our first apartment.
Then we moved to that building right there.
After Mal became pregnant, that became our home.
You reconstructed all of this from memory?
Like I told you, we had lots of time.
What is that?
That's the house Mal grew up in.
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.
Come on.
We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building.
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
What?
I'm gonna improvise.
Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
Highly contagious.
And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define...
...or destroy you.
The smallest idea, such as:
"Your world is not real."
Simple little thought that changes everything.
So certain of your world. Of what's real.
Do you think he is?
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
I know what's real, Mal.
No creeping doubts?
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
Chased around the globe...
...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
Admit it.
You don't believe in one reality anymore.
So choose.
Choose to be here.
Choose me.
You know what I have to do.
I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Because you left us.
I'm not wrong.
You're confused.
Our children are here.
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
Up above?
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.
Watch.
James? Phillipa?
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?
What if I'm what's real?
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Guilt.
I feel guilt, Mal.
And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...
...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there...
...reminding me of the truth.
What truth?
That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
You planted the idea in my mind?
What is she talking about?
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?
We were lost in here.
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.
She had locked something away, something deep inside.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
And she couldn't break free.
So I decided to search for it.
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
And I broke in...
...and I planted an idea.
A simple little idea that would change everything.
That her world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that'll take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you...
...but you can't know for sure.
Yet it doesn't matter.
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!
But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
...that even after she woke....
That even after you came back to reality...
...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
Mal, no! Jesus!
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.
You betrayed me.
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.
We can still be together, right here...
...in the world we built together.
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
You can't have him.
- lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?
Fischer is on the porch.
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
No.
I wish.
I wish more than anything, but...
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
...all your perfection, all your imperfection.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Look at you.
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.
And you were the best that I could do, but...
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.
Does this feel real?
- What are you doing?
- lmprovising.
No, no, no!
In there, now. Go, go, go.
I was dis--
I was dis-- Disa--
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--
I know you were disappointed...
...I couldn't be you.
No.
No, no, no.
I was disappointed...
...that you tried.
What?
Come on, come on.
Dad?
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!
I will!
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did.
We did. You don't remember?
I miss you more than I can bear...
...but we had our time together.
And I have to let you go.
I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, Robert.
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...
...not just to live for him.
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
What happened?
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?
No, to find Saito.
He'll be lost.
No, he'll be all right.
Have you come to kill me?
I'm waiting for someone.
Someone from a half-remembered dream.
Cobb?
Impossible.
We were young men together.
I'm an old man.
Filled with regret.
Waiting to die alone.
I've come back for you.
To remind you of something.
Something you once knew.
That this world is not real.
To convince me to honor our arrangement?
To take a leap of faith, yes.
Come back...
...so we can be young men together again.
Come back with me.
Come back.
Hot towel, sir?
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.
Do you need immigration forms?
Thank you.
Hot towel, sir?
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome.
This way.
James? Phillipa?
Look who's here.
Hey.
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy!
- How are you?
Look what I've been building!
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!
On the cliff? Come on, I want you to show me. Can you show me?
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
What's the matter, mister?
The water's come!
Here now.
Hold your left hand lower.
Try using your right hand...
...get less tired then.
Not enough sleep.
You can rest.
You're not used to it yet.
Were my veins filled with cement,
I bet I'd feel this way.
Get tired at first.
Will I ever get used to it?
You will.
I don't know.
Don't you feel all this is meaningless?
Are you raking sand to live, or living to rake sand...?
Of course, it's not so much fun as Tokyo.
I'm not talking about Tokyo!
How can you stand being trapped like this?
But it's my home.
Then demand your rights.
In my case, it's only till
I'm rescued.
Rescued?
Of course.
Away a week without leave.
Someone will call on me.
They'll see the book left open in my room...
...the small change in my pocket.
They're bound to wonder.
But for you, it's a lifelong problem.
My family's graves are here.
Yes, my husband and girl...
Then you...?
You'll leave if they're dug up?
You know how to make them let down the ladder.
I've nothing to do outside.
You could walk around!
Walk around?
Yes!
It's great to walk around freely!
Wouldn't you get more tired just walking around?
Don't joke!
Even dogs go crazy tied up forever!
And we're men!
But if it weren't for the sand, no one would bother about me.
Isn't it so? Even you...
Look, here's one.
Stop it!
This is what I came out here looking for.
A kind of tiger-beetle.
Got any scissors?
Scissors?
I just want to clip my beard.
I think I have some...
They're not very sharp.
They're pretty rusty.
The sand does it.
They don't work.
No?
Not even close.
We'll ask for a razor when they bring the ration.
See? The sand in my beard makes it all scratchy.
Really! That sand just makes a mess of everything.
Say, hurry up!
All right! Thanks!
Where's your "husband"?
Stomachache. Chilled, perhaps.
Love him too much?
A bath? Shall I help?
No, I'm tired today.
I'd like one.
No, you're sick.
My body feels sticky.
I must have sweated in bed.
I can boil it...
Let's. I'll help.
Never mind, I'll do it.
Thinking?
Not especially.
I'll take you. Stand there.
No, don't.
Come on.
Smile now.
Want to go home?
Why?
A radio would be good for you.
You'd hear about the world.
Silly!
You'd know all about Tokyo then.
That's what started me collecting insects.
Having my name in an insect book's better than nothing.
But a radio would take your mind off things.
I see.
Finish off that sake?
You're still sick.
Helps you sleep.
I feel sleepy enough without it.
Be a sport.
I can't drink.
Never mind. I feel like it today.
Looks boiling.
Come on.
You amaze me.
Now, drink up.
My, that feels good.
You're cruel, when I'm so tired.
Help!
Someone help me!
Help!
Catch hold of it.
Please pull me out with this.
We can't pull you out like a root.
We'll dig you out.
Grab on to the board.
Good thing we made it.
Quicksand around here.
Even the dogs won't come near.
How many people fell in before?
Hikers don't know about it.
If we dug, might find something valuable.
Two or three cameras for sure.
Be quiet.
I'm sorry.
Shall I make some tea?
What's the time?
I don't know... about 8:30?
I failed.
Yes.
Complete and utter failure.
Do you have...
...a wife?
In Tokyo...
That's no concern of yours.
No.
But it's too bad.
If I'd succeeded, I was going to buy a radio and send it to you.
A radio?
You wanted one...
That's all right.
You don't have to do that.
I can do piece-work and buy one here.
I failed.
Shall I wipe you up?
I should have known the geography.
They'll always come after me.
Behind me will be friends, a cooperative...
...the Board of Education and the PTA...
They won't leave me to my fate.
Come on. I'll wash you.
What is it?
My hope.
A crow trap.
I leave a bait here.
When a crow gets it, the sand will swallow it.
But crows are very clever.
Hunger makes them stupid.
But why is this your hope?
It is.
I'll tie a letter to its leg asking for help.
They don't come.
It's almost three months.
Who?
Your rescuers.
They may think you ran away...
Tired of your work.
Hardly.
I left my bankbook.
I left my book open on my desk.
Anyone would know.
The room's screaming for help.
What's there?
What?
In Tokyo...
So I said to go and see!
It's too much.
Your ration!
Say, wait! Wait!
Let me up awhile!
Thirty minutes, once a day, to see the sea!
I promise not to escape!
Twenty minutes! Even ten!
I've been good for three months!
I'm going out of my mind!
We'll talk it over and let you know!
Please! You can watch me!
Working hard.
Twenty more and I'll earn 1,000 yen.
Stupid!
I won't die like a dog!
Radio, nothing.
You'll be beyond help soon.
How can they be your friends?
I know it.
Everyone for himself.
Wagging your tail like a good dog.
Soon, we'll only have ourselves.
That can't be! We have the sand!
Sand? What's good in it?
Just makes trouble.
It sells.
Where?
At the town works.
Are you joking?
Against the law... it's salty!
In secret... at half price.
A total loss if it eats away dams and buildings.
That's other people's business.
Yes, it's other people's business.
But this phony business makes others rich.
Why help them?
The union buys and sells it.
They treat me very well.
I'll sift it.
Like building a house on water.
A boat might be better.
Why insist on a house?
But you want to go home, too?
That's...
Even a lie will do.
Perhaps, tomorrow...
If there's hope that something may happen...
I'm so frightened each morning when I go to sleep.
Afraid I'll wake up all alone again.
I'm really so frightened...
Put them in there.
Working hard, mister?
Too early for the carrier.
You want to see the sea?
Yes. Please! Will you let me?
We might consider it.
Please. I learned my lesson.
All right for an hour?
Then show us that.
Out in front, both of you, where everybody can see you.
That?
Yes, that.
You know, with your old lady.
You know!
I asked the others.
They said, "sure"!
What're you doing? Hurry up!
What'll we do?
It's ridiculous!
It's my chance.
Don't listen.
Look, we needn't take it so seriously.
What? We're not perverts!
We're pigs, anyhow!
Come on! Just pretend!
Fool! Fool! Fool!
Fool! Fool! Fool!
What's this?
Funny.
Not a drop of rain for three weeks.
Capillarity?
That's it!
It may mean we'll have enough water.
Surface evaporation must be acting as a suction pump.
The sand's a pump.
Like sitting on a pump.
Perhaps I can think of a more effective system to store the water.
It's awful. Can't even breathe.
It'll be December soon.
Again.
Getting cold and food's scarce.
Easier to catch a crow.
Really, men are...
My turn to be the trapper.
If the radio came, we could hear the weather report.
I'm afraid.
I'll bury it while the water boils.
Till tomorrow!
Help!
Someone, come here!
What is it?
Pains!
A baby.
A baby?
Since when?
October.
Hurt?
Nausea?
May be an abnormal pregnancy.
How do you know?
He used to shoe horses for a veterinarian.
Anyway, call a doctor!
He'll be too late.
Doctors nowadays...
Get a small truck.
It's come.
I'm afraid.
Is the wind down?
Yes, it's quieter.
How?
Bedding and all.
Let's do it.
Put a board beneath.
Radio.
The radio.
Bad timing. Shall I open it?
Want to take it?
In the bedding.
Have you got another board?
Take one from the shelf out back.
Below there. That one.
I don't want to go!
Listen, it's...
Something?
No, some other time.
I don't want to.
Pull her up!
No.
No...no...!
There's no need to rush away yet.
I am free to do as I like now.
What I want now is to tell someone about the water tank.
It will be best to tell the villagers.
If not today, maybe tomorrow.
I'm sure I'll end up telling somebody.
After that I can think of escaping.
REPORT OF MISSING PERSON
JUMPEI NIKI,
BORN MARCH 7, 1927
MISSING OVER 7 YEARS
LISTED AS DISAPPEARED
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.
How are you feeling?
Rested.
Medication time.
Medication time.
Okay, move it up!
Mr. Fredrickson, here.
Juice.
Chief.
Okay, my friend, let's go.
Here are his papers, and I'm going to need a signature.
Hi.
- Mr. McMurphy is here.
- All right.
Thank you.
All right, I'm ready.
Okay. One pair of socks.
T-shirt.
Hi.
Goddamn, boy, you're as big as a mountain!
Looks like you might have played some football.
What's your name?
He can't hear you. He's deaf.
Deaf and dumb Indian.
Is that so?
Come on, Bibbit.
Can't even make a sound, huh?
How.
Club lead. Jack of clubs.
What's your name, son?
Billy Bibbit.
Glad to know you, Bill. McMurphy's mine.
Those are old Charlie Cheswick's cards.
That's his ace of spades.
Your turn, Bill.
Big ten.
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.
Oh, I can win that one.
- I win.
- Oh, you overtrumped?
- Sure.
- Pinochle, Bill?
What's the bid?
You like to look at other people's cards, do you?
Yes.
Ever seen this one?
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini!
Martini, will you? Will you play a club?
Whose turn is it now?
Let's see, he trumped...
Where you going?
- Aren't you going to play?
- What's the matter?
Aren't you going to play, Martini?
Martini? I want to play.
Billy?
Billy, I want to win some...
Get a grip on yourself, will you?
Yes?
- Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc.
- Good, have him come in.
Thank you.
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is to meet you.
Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down and let's talk.
Sure.
R.P. McMurphy.
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah.
It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.
But I'll tell you, it took every bit of strength I had...
...to hold it while the guy took the picture.
Every damn bit.
Probably that chain didn't help it any, either.
You didn't weigh the chain, did you?
No, I didn't weigh the chain.
But, I'm awful proud of that picture.
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.
It's a nice one.
Randall Patrick McMurphy.
38 years old.
What can you tell me about...
...why you've been sent over here?
Well...
I don't know.
What's it say there?
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.
Well, it...
...says several things here.
It said you've been belligerent.
Talked when unauthorized.
You've been resentful in attitude towards work, in general. That you're lazy.
Chewing gum in class.
The real reason you've been sent here...
...is because they wanted you to be evaluated.
To determine whether or not you're mentally ill.
This is the real reason.
Why do you think they might think that?
Well, as near as I can figure out, it's because I...
...fight and fuck too much.
In the penitentiary?
No, you mean why...
Why did you get sent over here...
...from the work farm?
Well, I really don't know, Doc.
It says here that you went around...
- Let me just take a look...
- It ain't up to me.
One...
...two, three...
...four...
You've got at least...
...five arrests for assault.
What can you tell me about that?
Five fights, huh?
Rocky Marciano has 40, and he's a millionaire.
- That's true.
- That is true.
Of course, it's true that you went in for...
...statutory rape.
That's true, is it not, this time?
Absolutely true. But, Doc...
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...
...and she told me she was 18, and she was...
...very willing, you know what I mean?
I practically had to take to sewing my pants shut.
But between you and me...
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.
I don't think you do either.
I hear what you're saying.
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...
...because I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable.
It don't make a bit of sense to me.
If that's what being crazy is...
...then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, whacko.
But, no more, no less. That's it.
To be honest with you, McMurphy...
...what it says here...
...is that they think...
They think...
...you've been faking it in order to get out of your work detail.
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you?
Let's just be frank for a minute.
Randall, if you would.
Tell me...
Do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really?
Not a thing, Doc.
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.
You're going to be here for a period, for us to evaluate you.
We're going to study you.
We'll make our determinations as to what we're going to do...
...and give you the necessary treatment as indicated.
Doc, let me just tell you this.
I'm here to cooperate with you
100 percent.
100 percent.
I'll be just right down the line with you.
You watch.
Because I think we ought to get to the bottom of...
...R.P. McMurphy.
The scythe.
I'm awfully tired.
Sit down.
- God, I'm tired.
- Sit down.
Is that better?
Mr. Ellsworth...
...you'll wear yourself out.
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.
At the close of Friday's meeting...
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.
Mr. Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy...
...because she drew stares from men on the street.
Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
Yes.
That's correct.
He also thinks he may have given her reason...
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't able to say how.
Mr. Harding has been heard to say to his wife:
"I hate you.
"I don't ever want to see you again.
"You've betrayed me."
So, does anyone care to touch on this further?
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?
Are you sure?
Billy, how about you?
No, ma'am.
I'd like to write in my book that you began the meeting.
Just once.
Mr. Martini?
Are you with us?
Yes.
Would you like to begin?
Mr. Cheswick?
- Me?
- Yes.
You mean there's not a man here who has an opinion on this matter?
All right.
Mr. Harding...
...you've stated on more than one occasion...
...that you've suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, very much, I suspect her.
I suspect her.
Maybe you can tell us why...
...you suspect her.
Well, I can only...
...speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...
...that perhaps you are...
...impatient with your wife...
...because she doesn't meet your mental requirements?
Perhaps. But you see, the only thing I can really...
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...
...is the very existence of my life...
...with or without my wife...
...in terms of the human relationships, the juxtaposition of...
...one person to another, the form, the content.
Harding, why don't you knock off the bullshit and get to the point?
This is the point.
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life!
I can't seem to get that through to you.
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody!
I'm talking about form!
I'm talking about content!
I'm talking about interrelationships!
I'm talking about God, the Devil,
Hell, Heaven!
Do you understand? Finally?
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.
It makes me feel very peculiar, very peculiar...
...when you throw in something like that.
- Why?
What does that mean, "peculiar"?
- Peculiar?
- Peculiar?
I'm going to tell you guys something.
You just don't want to learn anything.
You just don't want to listen to anybody.
He's got intelligence!
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?
Say, what are you trying to say?
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Is that your idea of communicating something to me?
Well, is it?
They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.
They're all ganging up on you.
Is that news?
They sometimes want to gang up on me, too, but I...
Cheswick, do me a favor.
Take it easy.
- And stay off my side.
- But I only want to...
I only want to help you.
- I understand.
- But don't you want me to...
- Please!
- But I only want to...
- Please!
- But I only want to help you.
Please!
You see...
...the other day you made some allusions, both of you.
- Illusions?
- Yes, allusions.
Not illusions. Allusions...
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.
Let's say it's true! Let's say
I know it's true, but you don't!
If that's your idea of trying to tell me something...
You know, Harding, I think you're some kind of morbid asshole!
- "Peculiar!"
- "Asshole" again.
It makes you feel "peculiar."
You've talked about your wife ever since I can remember!
You know, she's on your mind, and blah, blah...
I'm not talking about my wife!
When will you get that through your thick head?
When are you going to wise up and turn her loose?
- Please!
- I don't want to hear it!
- I'm tired.
- I don't want to hear it!
I'm tired.
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.
I don't want to hear it!
We know you're tired. We're all tired.
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.
Take your hands off me!
Recreation time, gentlemen.
The bus is waiting.
All nonrestricted patients
please report to the bus.
Ever play this game, Chief?
Come on, I'll show you.
Old Indian game.
It's called "put the ball in the hole."
Now, that ought to be just...
Hold it right there.
All right.
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.
Never move. That's your spot, you understand?
Right there. You don't move. Now...
...take the ball.
Here, take the ball.
That's it. Hold on to it.
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?
All right. Now, raise up your arms.
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.
McMurphy?
What the hell are you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.
I ain't talking to him.
I'm talking to myself. It helps me think.
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?
See? Don't hurt him.
All right, now, Chief.
Let's raise our hands up in the air.
Just raise them up.
Up, you understand?
Raise the hands up, here.
Up. Raise your hands up.
Up! That's it! That's it!
Up, all the way up.
All the way up. That's a baby, all right.
Okay, now...
Now, jump up in the air, and put it in the basket, Chief.
Jump up and dunk it in!
Jump up in the air and stuff that son of a bitch in there, Chief.
Take a rest, Chief.
Just stay right there.
Take a rest. I'll be right back.
Bancini, come here for a minute.
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.
Now, just stand right there.
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.
Stand up. Go ahead.
That's a baby! All right, you got it.
All right. Now, over there.
Hit me, Chief! I got the moves!
I got them, Chief!
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.
Now...
...hold it right there.
You take the ball, you jump up, and put it in the basket.
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.
Now, jump up and put it in the basket, Chief!
Jump up and put it in the basket!
Not you, Bancini.
Raise up! Bancini, where you going?
I'm tired!
Fast break! Defense! Get back!
Come on, Bancini, where the fuck you going at?
General, get this man around here.
That's it, back!
Over to Chief.
Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief!
Hit me, baby!
Put it in the basket, Chief!
Put it in the basket!
All right.
Make the bets.
What's this?
Make the bets.
It's a dime, Martini.
I bet a nickel.
A dime is the limit, Martini.
I bet a dime.
This is not a dime, Martini.
This is a dime.
If you break it in half...
...you don't get two nickels, you get shit.
Try and smoke it. You understand?
You don't understand!
All right, here they come.
Queen to the Chesser,
Big Bull to Tabulations...
...ten to Billy to match his whang, and the dealer gets a three.
Hit me. Hit me.
I can't hit you because it ain't your turn yet. You understand?
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.
These are real people here.
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?
Hit me.
That's 23 up, Cheswick.
Taber, you're busted. Give me this.
Twenty-three.
- Hit me.
- Shut up!
Taber.
- Give me a dime!
- I'm next.
You're not next!
Hit me.
- Ace.
- Hit me.
That's 4 or 14.
Don't want any more. Billy?
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Five.
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.
I bet a dime.
All right, here.
- That's 20 showing.
- No.
- Take your money.
- No.
It's not.
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.
This is a fucking queen here, you understand?
You don't count the this and the this.
Hit me.
You got 20 showing!
Hit me again. I want another card.
Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?
Medication time.
This isn't a queen!
Mac, hit me.
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.
Jesus Christ Almighty!
Do you nuts want to play cards or do you want to fucking jerk off?
Play the game!
I can't even hear myself think already, here.
Stay back!
- Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to...
- Stay back!
Patients aren't allowed in the nurses' station.
Well, I just wanted to turn...
When you're outside, we'll discuss whatever problem you have, okay?
The patients are not allowed in the nurses' station. All right?
Yes, ma'am.
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you.
Excuse me, miss.
Do you think it might be possible to turn the music down...
...so maybe a couple of the boys could talk?
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.
I know, but do you think we might ease it down a little...
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?
What you probably don't realize...
...is that we have a lot of old men in this ward...
...who couldn't hear the music if we turned it lower.
That music is all they have.
Your hand is staining my window.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- All right.
Mr. McMurphy, your medication.
What's in the horse pill?
It's just medicine. It's good for you.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking something if I don't know what it is.
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.
It's just that I don't want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter.
You know what I mean?
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally...
...I'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way.
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?
Give it to me.
Good.
Very good!
Yummy!
Mr. Harding?
Merci.
Tell me, lover-boy...
...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?
Jesus Christ.
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?
You know that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.
God Almighty, she's got you guys coming and going.
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?
No, I thought you were the champ.
You want to bet?
Bet on what?
One week.
I bet in one week I can put a bug so far up her ass...
...she won't know whether to shit or wind her wrist watch.
What do you say to that? Want to bet?
Do you want to bet?
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?
You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck.
I'll bet.
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.
Last time we were discussing...
...Mr. Harding and the problem with his wife...
...and I think we were making a lot of progress.
So who would like to begin today?
Mr. McMurphy?
I've been thinking about what you said about...
...you know, getting things off your chest.
Well, there's a couple of things that I'd like to get off my chest.
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.
Today, as you may or may not know, it doesn't matter...
...is the opening of the World Series.
What I'd like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight...
...so that we can watch the ball game.
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...
...is that we change a very carefully worked-out schedule.
A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.
Some men on the ward take a long, long time to get used to the schedule.
Change it now, and they might find it very disturbing.
Fuck the schedule! They can go back to the schedule after the Series.
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.
Well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this.
How would it be if we had a vote...
...and let the majority rule?
Great. Let's vote on it.
So, all those in favor raise your hands.
Okay, guys, come on.
Put your hands up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...
...to get some exercise, putting your arms up in the air.
That's it. Come on, let's...
What is this crap?
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler they run it there or they'll have a riot.
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans!
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...
...that's not enough to change the ward policy.
I'm sorry.
My turn. Okay, hot dice.
I want a ten to go...
...because I need cash.
I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue.
Big ten! Perfect.
Two fives.
- What are you doing?
- Hotel.
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.
For the third time...
...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.
It costs $1,000 and four green houses...
...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.
Play the game and knock off the bullshit.
Play the game.
What are you talking about? I am.
- Play the game!
- I ain't doing anything to you!
- What bullshit?
- Your bullshit!
- What about your bullshit?
- Play!
- You keep your hands off me!
- Play the game!
I've had enough bullshit from you!
- Play the game.
- What are you picking on me for?
Play the game, Harding.
- I'm trying to ignore you, see?
- Just play the game.
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!
Keep your hands off me! You hear me?
- Come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see!
Play the game.
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more!
Just once more, huh? Just once more!
- Just touch me once more!
- Play the game, Harding!
Just touch me once more!
Holy Jesus!
Is that what your schedule does for you, Hard-on?
Goddamn lunatic!
I don't know what you're talking about.
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?
Because I'm going downtown to watch the World Series, anyway.
Anybody want to come with me?
I do, Mac. I want to go with you!
Ches, all right. Anybody else?
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.
Mac, you can't...
...get out of here.
Anybody want to bet?
Chicken shits!
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched his big thing...
...and she'll open the door for him.
Yeah, maybe I will...
...and then maybe I'll use your thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.
Sefelt, see?
Why? My head would squash like an eggplant.
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head!
I'll take this thing, and put it through the window...
...and me and Cheswick will go out through the hall...
...downtown, sit down in a bar, wet our whistles...
...and watch the ball game.
And that's the bet.
Now, does anybody want any of it?
You're going to lift that thing?
Yeah! That's right.
I'll bet a buck.
Taber, $1.
I bet a dime.
Mac, you can't...
...lift that thing.
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?
I'll bet $25!
$25, Hard-on!
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.
You know what I mean?
All right.
All right.
Giving up?
No! Just warming up.
Warming up.
This will be the one.
All right, baby.
But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it!
At least I did that.
And on the mound, the left-hander,
Al Downing.
The two pitchers still warming up,
right down below us.
The second game of
the 1963 World Series...
... is being brought to you
from Yankee Stadium.
Did you tell the girl how you felt about her?
I went over to her house...
...one Sunday afternoon and...
...and I brought her some flowers...
...and I said:
"Celia, will you...
"...marry me?"
Why did you want to marry her?
Well, I was in love with her.
Your mother told me that you never told her about it.
Why didn't you tell her about it?
Wasn't that the first time you tried to commit suicide?
Oh, my God!
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
Miss Ratched...
...I'd like to ask you a question, please.
Go ahead.
Okay.
You know, if Billy doesn't feel like talking...
...I mean, why are you pressing him?
Why can't we go on to some new business?
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...
...is therapy.
You know, I don't understand this,
Miss Ratched...
...because I don't...
Mr. McMurphy...
...said something yesterday about a World Series.
A baseball game?
You know, and I've never been to a baseball game and...
...I think I'd like to see one.
That would be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?
I thought we'd decided that issue.
I don't think so, because, I mean...
...we discussed that yesterday...
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?
That's right, Ches, and we want a new vote on it, don't we?
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?
Yeah.
It'll satisfy me.
There's a vote before the group.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule, please raise your hand.
Okay, I want to see the hands. Come on!
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?
All right. That's it!
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.
There are 18 patients on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...
...and you have to have a majority to change ward policy.
So you gentlemen can put your hands down now.
Are you trying to tell me that you're going to count these?
These poor sons of bitches, they don't know what we're talking about.
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.
These men are members of the ward, just as you are.
All right. All I need is one vote, right?
Right?
All right.
Okay.
Want to watch the World Series?
This could be a big moment for you.
You want to watch a baseball game?
You want to watch baseball?
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.
Sorry.
Bancini, old horse.
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?
What do you say, pal? You're tired?
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?
I'm tired. Awfully tired.
Okay. All right.
What about you, pal?
All we need is one vote. Just one.
Just your one vote. That's all we need.
Just raise your hand up and your buddies can watch the baseball game.
General, you remember, don't you?
October, the banner, the stars...
"Oh, say can you"
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.
Just raise your hand up.
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.
For Christ's sake, isn't there one of you fucking maniacs...
...that knows what I'm talking about?
Mr. McMurphy?
The meeting is adjourned.
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?
You can bring the subject up again tomorrow.
All right, Chief...
...you're our last chance. What do you say?
Just raise your hand up.
That's all we need from you today, Chief.
Just raise your hand up one time.
Show her that you can do it.
Show her that you can still do it.
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?
Come on, there's got to be one guy here that's not a total fucking nut!
Mac?
Chief! The Chief!
Nurse Ratched? Nurse Ratched, look!
Look. The Chief put his hand up.
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.
Would you please turn the television set on?
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.
The Chief voted. Now...
...will you please turn the television set on?
Mr. McMurphy...
...the meeting was adjourned, and the vote was closed.
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!
No, Mr. McMurphy.
When the meeting was adjourned, the vote was nine to nine.
Come on, you're not going to say that now!
You're not going to say that now!
You're going to pull that henhouse shit, now, when the vote...
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!
Cheswick.
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.
Koufax.
Koufax kicks. He delivers.
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.
Richardson's rounding first, going for second!
The ball's into deep right center!
Davidson cuts the ball off!
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around first!
He slides, he's in there. It's a double!
He's in there!
Look at Richardson, on second base.
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!
Tresh looks in. Koufax...
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is snapping off like a firecracker.
Here he comes with the next pitch.
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!
It's going! It's gone!
Somebody give me a fucking wiener before I die.
It's the great Mickey Mantle, now!
Here comes the pitch!
Mantle swings!
It's a fucking home run!
Gentlemen, stop this.
Stop this immediately.
Do you like it here?
That fucking nurse, man!
What do you mean, sir?
She ain't honest.
Miss Ratched is one of the finest nurses we've got in this institution.
Well, I don't want to break up the meeting or nothing...
...but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, Doc?
How do you mean that?
She likes a rigged game, you know what I mean?
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...
...for the last four weeks...
...and I don't see any evidence of mental illness, at all.
I think that you've been trying to put us on all this time.
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.
You know what I mean? Is that it?
Is that crazy enough for you?
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?
Yeah.
Does that mean something to you?
It's the same as "Don't wash your dirty underwear in public."
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?
Well that, sort of, has always meant...
...it's hard for something to grow on something that's moving.
How did you feel about what happened yesterday?
You want to kill.
You know what I mean?
Do you gentlemen have any more questions?
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.
Do you have a question, McMurphy?
Where do you suppose she lives?
Chief, come on with me.
We'll show these guys who's nuts.
All right, wait.
Stand right here.
All right. Grab the fence.
Grab the fence here.
Right here, Chief. Strong!
Strong, like this, here.
That's it. All right.
Okay. Up.
That's it.
All right, you got it?
All right, push!
Come on, Bob!
Where are you going?
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh?
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
See how easy it is?
Boys.
This here is Candy.
Candy, these are the boys.
You all crazy?
Let's go. Down here.
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Down here.
No problem.
Right here.
Come on, we don't want to be late for our first day out.
Hello!
Come on, will you?
What are you standing around for?
Get on board. Give them these.
Hey, wait a minute!
What the heck is going on here?
What are you doing on this boat?
We're going fishing.
No, you're not going fishing.
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.
Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block.
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.
Who are you?
We're from the...
...State Mental Institution.
This is Dr. Cheswick...
...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson...
...Dr. Scanlon.
The famous Dr. Scanlon.
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...
...Dr. Martini, and...
...Dr. Sefelt.
How about you? Who are you?
I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.
Wait... Wait one second.
You don't understand.
We chartered the boat.
We're going to go fishing.
And that's all there is to it.
You better quit on this.
They'll throw you in the can again, you know?
No, they won't. We're nuts!
They'll just take us back to the feeb farm, see?
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.
Tabes, you're at the bow.
This one?
That one! The one at your feet.
Get back on! Jesus!
Tabes!
Cheswick! Come here, quick!
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac!
Take it easy, Charlie.
Have you ever driven one of these things?
- Driven one of...
- Yeah.
No, Mac.
Well, it's a lot of fun.
Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.
- Put your hands on.
- I never did...
Put your hands on the wheel so you don't fall down. All right.
Just hold it steady right there, like that.
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.
Now just go straight.
- Straight as an arrow.
- Straight, Mac?
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac...
Mac, this thing ain't too steady.
- Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight.
Just go on!
This is the bait.
Little fishes.
Dead fishes.
That's right.
Now what are we going to do with these little fishes?
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.
And hooks.
Hooks.
Now, hold on to your hooks...
...because here are the fishes.
Tabes.
Get a fish here.
There, for you, Martini.
All right, now we, each one of us has got a fish.
What are you laughing at?
You're not an idiot, huh?
You're not a goddamn looney now, boy, you're a fisherman.
Now, take your bottom hook.
You got it?
You take it...
...and you...
...push it all the way through.
Like that.
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes, here.
- Right through here.
- In the eye?
Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini.
Jesus Christ, just put it through his eyeball, here.
That's it.
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.
That's very good.
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson!
Very good eye work.
Good eye work.
That little devil's going to not even feel the sting, is he, boy?
That son of a gun is going to bite on you, isn't he?
You got beautiful hair.
Thank you.
And you got...
...beautiful eyes.
Thank you.
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?
They do.
Come on with me, over here.
I'm going to give each and every one of you a rod.
All right.
Here are your poles.
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.
Understand?
Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys!
Don't call me unless you get something really big...
...you can't handle yourselves.
Keep on fishing!
That's right.
Where is everybody?
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to...
...steer that boat straight!
Fish! Help, help!
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it!
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there in front!
Tabes, I got it, Tabes!
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you!
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up!
I got it!
I got it! Give it to me!
Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.
Shut up!
He said to go straight out as an arrow.
You're not going straight, you're kind of...
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it!
- It's my duty!
- Chessy, stop it!
No, you son of a bitch!
All right, Martini.
All right, take him over!
Take him over!
That's it! Now play them, boys!
You sons of bitches!
Keep it straight!
Come back this way!
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut!
Beats bowling, you know what I mean?
We caught it, look!
They're going to be trolling this place for six months looking for dead bodies!
I think he's dangerous.
He's not crazy...
...but he's dangerous.
You don't think he's crazy?
No, he's not crazy.
Dr. Songee?
I don't think he's overly psychotic.
But I still think he's quite sick.
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.
Well, John, what do you want to do with him?
I think we've had our turn.
I'd like to send him back to the work farm, frankly.
Is there anybody that you have...
...on your staff, that could...
...relate to him? Maybe understand him.
Help him out with some of these problems?
The funny thing is that the person he's the closest to...
...is the one he dislikes the most.
That's you, Mildred.
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion, if we send him back to Pendleton or...
...we send him up to Disturbed...
...it's just one more way of passing on our problem to somebody else.
You know, we don't like to do that.
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.
I think we can help him.
Chief, Chief, come on.
Come with me, huh?
Chief, this is the spot.
Right there is the spot. Remember?
Raise the hands, in the basket.
That's it. Raise the hands up.
All right! Let's have a little ball from you nuts in here! Here we go!
All right! Let's play ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves!
Hey, Mac. Time, time.
You've got six men on the court.
Harding, out of the ball game.
Hey, why me?
Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.
I don't trust you.
I'll go.
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?
Let's play ball. Harding, break over there.
All right, Martini, get it back.
I'm in the open! What're you doing?
You threw the goddamn ball into the fence!
Christ Almighty, you threw it into the fence!
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!
- For Christ's sake!
- Hey, Mac, I'm open!
Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding! Here.
I'm open. Will you give me the ball?
- Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!
- I got it!
Harding, over here.
Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing...
- You were covered!
- I was open!
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the...
I was open. Give me the ball.
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Chief! Atta baby, put it in!
Get down there!
Get down there, Chief! All right, all right.
Get around, Chief!
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief!
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!
- That's bullshit!
- Ball's in play.
Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy.
Man, that doesn't go!
That ball ain't in play!
Come on, Chief! Put it in!
What a ball club!
McMurphy, get off the side.
- Come on, move it, man!
- Hey, damn it!
Quick! Come on, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?
By the time you get out of here...
...you'll be too old to even get it up.
Sixty-eight days, buddy.
Sixty-eight days.
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days!
That's in jail, sucker.
You still don't know where you're at?
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?
With us, baby, you're with us.
And you're going to stay with us until we let you go.
Do you want to say something to the group, Mr. McMurphy?
I'd like to know why none of the guys never told me that you...
...Miss Ratched...
...and the doctors could keep me here till you're good and ready to turn me loose.
That's what I'd like to know.
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.
Would anyone care to answer Mr. McMurphy?
Answer what?
You heard me, Harding.
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...
...knowing how much I had to lose and you never told me nothing!
Now, Mac, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything about how much...
- Shit!
- Wait a minute. Listen.
Now, look...
I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home anytime I want.
You can go home anytime you want?
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me!
He's bullshitting me, right?
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.
As a matter of fact, there are very few men here who are committed.
There's Mr. Bromden.
Mr. Taber.
Some of the chronics, and you.
Cheswick?
You're voluntary?
Scanlon?
Billy, for Christ's sake, you must be committed, right?
No, no, no.
You're just a young kid!
What're you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?
What's so funny about that?
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing but complain about how you can't...
...stand it in this place, and then you haven't got the guts to walk out?
What do you think you are, for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?
Well, you're not. You're not!
No crazier than the average asshole walking around on the streets.
And that's it.
Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!
Those are very challenging observations you made, Randall.
I'm sure some of the men would like to comment.
Mr. Scanlon?
I want to know why the dorm is locked in the daytime and on weekends.
I would like to know about our cigarettes.
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick, and wait your turn.
Go ahead, sit down!
To answer your question about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon.
You know very well...
...that if we left the door open, you'd just go right back to bed after breakfast.
Am I right?
So what?
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?
For Christ's sake!
Cigarettes!
Remember, Mr. Scanlon, we've discussed many times...
...that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic.
While time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation.
You remember that, don't you?
Do you mean to say...
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?
Miss Ratched?
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!
- I want to know about...
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.
I want to...
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
It's my last one.
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?
Come on!
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.
And I don't want his, or his, or his...
...or his, or his, or his...
Or even yours.
Do you understand that?
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched!
I want my cigarettes!
I want mine, Miss Ratched!
What gives you the damn right...
...to keep our cigarettes piled up on your desk...
...and to squeeze out a pack only when you feel like it, huh?
- Miss Ratched!
- Mr. Harding!
Oh, I'm sorry.
- You surprise me.
- I lost my head. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.
It's all right.
Miss Ratched!
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
I asked you a question!
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...
...and I will answer your question as soon as you've calmed down.
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?
- I'm calm.
- Good.
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...
...has been running a small gambling casino in our tub room.
Now, most of you lost all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...
...not to mention a tidy sum of money to Mr. McMurphy.
And that's why...
...your tub room privileges have been suspended...
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.
Mr. Martini?
How are we going to win our money back?
You're not going to win your money back, Mr. Martini.
That's all over.
If you had obeyed the rules in the first place...
...you wouldn't have lost your money.
Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!
Rules?
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!
Sit down. Will you?
I want you to know something right here and now!
- I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!
- You sit down!
What, are you going to have cigarettes kept from me like cookies?
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?
That's right! Will you sit down?
No, I won't! I won't!
I want something done!
- Sit down!
- I want something done!
I want something done!
I want something done!
I want something done!
I want something done!
- Here!
- I want something done!
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here!
Hey, calm down!
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's going to be all right!
Emergency 34-B.
I'll break your fucking wrist!
Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy!
Warren!
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.
Just move right over there, okay.
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit.
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, here.
That's it.
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.
Would you keep an eye on these three?
Would you please take these, gentlemen?
He can't hear nothing.
Calm down, Ches, will you?
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?
Mr. Cheswick?
- No!
- Nobody's gonna hurt you, come on.
- No!
- It'll be all right.
No one's going to hurt you.
No, leave me alone!
- Take it easy on yourself. Come on!
- No! Mac!
Mac! Mac!
No!
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.
- Come on.
- No!
I didn't do nothing!
Mac!
- Come on.
- I won't go! I don't want to go!
Want some gum?
Thank you.
Juicy Fruit.
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.
Can you hear me, too?
Yeah, you bet!
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!
And they all, they all think you're deaf and dumb.
Jesus Christ!
You fooled them, Chief.
You fooled them. You fooled them all!
Goddamn!
What are we doing in here, Chief?
What's us two guys doing in this fucking place?
Let's get out of here.
Out.
Canada?
Canada.
We'll be there before these sons of bitches know what hit them.
Listen to Randall on this one.
Mr. McMurphy?
Please follow me.
You and me, Chief.
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.
I'll be fine.
Would you sit up, please?
- I'd love to.
- Atta boy.
There might be a little fluid in them boots, you know what I mean, boys?
Just a little leak.
A light shine, boys, and...
...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.
All right, out with your gum.
Out with your gum.
Okay, this won't hurt, and it'll be over in just a moment.
- What's that?
- Conductant.
A little dab will do you.
Right, Mr. Jackson?
Open your mouth.
- What's that?
- This'll keep you from biting your tongue.
Now just bite down on it.
That's right. Just bite down.
Now, bite down on it.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Now, one big breath.
Very good.
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.
Jim?
It's been brought to my attention...
...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson your medication.
Is that true?
No, ma'am.
Jim?
Are you giving your medication to Mr. Fredrickson...
...or are you not?
How about it, you creeps, you lunatics, mental defectives.
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall, back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.
Look at the faces on you!
Look at you!
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings!
The mental defective league in formation.
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.
We're happy to have you back, Randall.
Thank you.
Would you like to rest today, or would you like to join the group?
I'd love to join the group.
I'd like...
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.
How's it going, Mac?
Perfect, Billy boy, absolutely perfect.
They were giving me 10,000 watts a day, you know, and I'm...
...hot to trot.
The next woman who takes me on will light up like a pinball machine...
...and pay off in silver dollars!
That's an amusing thought, Randall...
...but when you came in we were talking to Jim.
He has a problem with his medication...
...and we'd like to get back to that.
Oh, I don't mind at all,
Nurse Ratched, I'm...
...as gentle as a puppy dog.
Please proceed. Thank you.
The administration was hopeful,
but cautious Friday in its reaction...
... to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall...
... during the upcoming Christmas holiday.
Good night, gentlemen.
See you in the morning.
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.
It's on tonight.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it. Get a car.
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to!
I have to go! I have to go!
Don't forget to bring some booze.
Right. 'Bye.
Chief, I can't take it no more.
I have to get out of here.
I can't. I just can't.
It's easier than you think, Chief.
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.
Why, Chief, you're about as big as a goddamn tree trunk.
My poppa's real big.
He did like he pleased.
That's why everybody worked on him.
The last time I've seen my father he was blind in the cedars from drinking.
And every time he put the bottle to his mouth...
...he don't suck out of it.
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...
...wrinkled and yellow, even the dogs don't know him.
Killed him, huh?
I'm not saying they killed him.
They just worked on him, the way they're working on you.
There they are, Chief.
There they are. They're here.
Over here. That's it!
McMurphy, stop all this holy roller shit...
...and get your ass back in bed.
Do you understand?
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.
Come on and see.
You'd take $20...
...to get down on your knees and pray, wouldn't you, Turkle?
No, it don't send me, don't send me.
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.
Well, you know there'll be more.
I mean, they'll be bringing a couple of bottles with them, and...
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer, but...
...they're going to be sharing more than just bottles, ain't they?
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.
- I know what you mean.
- Understand what I mean?
Yeah, I understand what you mean.
- Anything you say.
- I'm on my knees, brother.
- I'm on my knees.
- Yeah, all right, all right.
I'll let them in.
- Let me just give them a hand here.
- I appreciate that.
- Hi.
- Ladies!
Oh, thank you. I believe this is your department, Mr. Turkle.
- Hi, there! Give me a hand.
- How're you doing?
Love to give you a hand.
Keep it down. Keep it down.
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down!
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down!
This looks like my high school.
Oh, hey, I take that.
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.
It is mine, mine.
You can have it. You can have it, honey.
Get a load of these tubs.
It's a real nice place you got here.
Hey, can I take a bath?
Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.
Just don't drown your pretty little self.
You know...
...Rose was married to a maniac once, up in Beaverton.
Oh, really, miss?
What seemed to be the problem?
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs in my bra all the time.
Very interesting.
Very interesting.
Rose is very interested in hospitals, and hospital facilities.
- I am?
- Yes. Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm going to take Miss Candy...
- Where you going?
I'm going to take Candy for a stroll.
I got you, I got you.
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep.
Now, you come over here, baby, right over here.
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.
Wake up, boys.
Wake up.
It's medication time.
Medication time.
The nighttime spirits are here.
It's Randall to say goodbye...
... and get you high,
and nighttime angel, Candy.
That's right, Mr. Martini,
there is an Easter bunny.
Around the side, join Mr. McMurphy...
... in the executive lounge, please.
Around the side.
It's going to be so great.
You'd like a nip, Charles?
No trouble at all!
It's Billy the Club of the fabulous and fantastic...
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle.
Ain't this a bitch!
McMurphy, what're you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired?
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Come on.
We're just having a party.
Party, my ass! This ain't no nightclub, this is a hospital!
Man, this is my fucking job!
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job!
Oh, shit! The supervisor!
Get your asses back in there.
Come on. Come on there!
Where's that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there?
Good. Come on.
Mr. Turkle?
Mr. Turkle?
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?
He's jerking off somewhere.
Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere, motherfucker!
Turkle, what the fuck are you doing here?
Go out and talk to her!
Doing the same fucking thing you're doing in here, hiding!
Yes, ma'am?
Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle?
Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.
Just fine. Just fine.
Who's there?
Ain't nobody in there.
Please open that door.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...
...you know, a man gets awfully lonesome at night.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
You understand? I'm sure you understand.
I want that woman off this ward immediately.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
- Jesus!
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?
Shit! Yes, and so am I...
...so get your behinds out of here and go to bed.
Go ahead, move it! Move it!
- I knew we were in trouble!
- Let's go!
You and your teddy bear ass!
Move them on out of here!
Come on, come on!
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy!
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.
Tell those fucking friends of mine to stay out!
- Get out!
- I'm really sorry.
What are you...
What the fuck? Get out of here!
Please get out, this is my job!
You're fucking it up! You understand?
Get out!
Get out of here, you slim motherfucker!
Fuck it!
Fuck it!
Good night, good night, don't let the cooties bite.
Right out of the shock department.
I got it from...
I got it from Ratched's charts.
Right. There you go. Easy now.
Don't take it all at once!
Let's try a little over here. There you go.
Let's go.
I'll have to be the one, Chief.
Hey, Mac, what's going on?
Well, Dale...
...Lord Randall is stepping down one.
Fredrickson.
Jimmy.
Aren't you going to say goodbye to me?
Sure, I'm going to say goodbye to you, Charles.
Thank you, Mac.
Thank you.
I'll never forget you.
Settle down, Charles, all right.
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?
Billy, for Christ's sake?
What's the matter?
I'm going to miss you very...
...very much, Mac.
Why don't you come with us, then?
Think I don't want to?
Well, come on then, let's go.
Well, it's not that easy.
I'm not ready yet.
Tell you what we'll do...
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...
...and I'll put my address on it.
That way when you're ready, you'll...
...you'll know where to go.
What do you say?
Is she going with you?
Candy?
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.
Are you going to marry her?
No, we're just good friends.
Why?
Nothing.
Don't "nothing" me, all right? What is it?
It's too late.
Do you want a date with her?
Jesus, I must be crazy to be in a looney bin like this!
Date, huh?
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.
Not now!
Not now?
When, then?
When I have a free weekend.
You're busy right now, are you?
You have something to do right now?
- You have something to do?
- No.
Good, then don't talk to me about when you're ready. Yeah.
- Ready and everything like that.
- No.
Candy, come here a minute.
I want you to meet the famous Billy.
Go get him, will you?
Go get him. Get him out of there.
I want you to get a hold of Billy...
All you have to do is one little thing.
- The kid is cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Think of me the whole time.
There he is.
Billy the Club!
I got $25...
...that says you are going to burn this woman down!
Candy, baby...
...I love you.
Hurl the ringer.
Take it easy! Back!
No, I'll show you some card tricks.
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.
That's 40 percent more torture.
I'm going to present you with this fine deck of cards for playing.
This ain't going to take long, Rose, you know what I mean?
When we get to Canada...
Out of sight, man!
Out of sight!
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.
Mr. Warren...
...close the window, and lock the screen.
Right.
Mr. Miller, show this woman the way out of the hospital.
Gladly.
Come on, lady, let's go.
- You're going home.
- Where?
Let her go, Scanlon.
You're going home.
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.
Make sure no one is missing.
Will do.
- Mac?
- Come on, Scanlon, let's move.
Everybody, out of here! Move it out!
Come on, move it!
Martini, get your butt up! Come on, up!
All right, get your dead ass up there!
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out!
Miss Ratched?
What are you doing?
Where you going? Back out here!
Let's go! Come on, move it!
Taber, get up. Come on.
I said, get up!
All right, move it back there!
Get your ass over here, and bring Dracula with you.
Move it.
Stay right there, Bancini!
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes.
It looks like Billy is the only one missing.
Billy?
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds of the hospital, gentlemen?
I want an answer to my question!
Did he leave the grounds of the hospital?
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.
You start with the tub room.
Mr. Martini?
May I have my cap, please?
My cap!
My cap!
There.
Thank you.
Miss Ratched.
I can explain everything.
Please do, Billy.
Explain everything.
Everything?
Aren't you ashamed?
No, I'm not.
You know, Billy, what worries me is...
...how your mother's going to take this.
Well, you...
...don't have to tell her, Miss Ratched.
I don't have to tell her?
Your mother and I are old friends, you know that.
Please don't...
...tell my mother.
Don't you think you should've thought of that before you took that woman...
...in that room?
No, no.
I didn't.
You mean, she dragged you in there by force?
She did.
Everybody did.
Everybody? Who did?
You tell me who did!
McMurphy.
Miss Ratched...
...please don't...
...tell my mother, please.
Would you see that the men are washed and ready for the day?
Miss Ratched, please, please...
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No.
Stay with him till the doctor arrives.
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!
Hey, that way, please. Please, gentlemen.
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?
Let's go.
Hey, what the hell is that?
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?
Washington, to the day room!
Immediately!
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.
Move away from the window and take that damn Chief with you.
Come on, let's go!
Let me through!
Let me through!
Out of the way, McMurphy!
Come on, clear it!
Get these people out of here!
Oh, Billy!
Will you guys clear the door?
Everybody out! Out! Everybody out!
Come on, goddamn it!
Now calm down!
The best thing we can do is go on with our daily routine.
All right?
Don't! Mac!
Mac! No!
And the bets are placed.
There's one for Tabes, and Chessy, and Martini, and the dealer.
And a four to Tabes, and a six, and a nine...
...and a ten to the dealer.
A nine?
What do you say, Tabes?
A dime apiece.
No? You stick.
- He sticks.
- He sticks with a four.
Chessy's going for the ride.
What does that mean?
He wants a hit. Yeah, and a big queen.
I think you're busted.
Buggered, not busted.
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.
And weep.
Hit me.
I think you're over.
- I know you're over.
- Hovno.
That's a three. Hovno.
Mr. Sefelt?
Did everything go well?
That's very nice.
Now you feel better, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Deuce to the dealer.
Split them. Higher.
McMurphy is out.
McMurphy has escaped.
They were taking him through the tunnel.
He beat up two of the attendants and escaped.
McMurphy is upstairs.
Oh, no, no!
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...
...and he's as meek as a lamb.
Really?
I mean, how do you know?
Jack Dunphy told me.
Jack Dunphy is full of shit!
Right! Right!
They said you escaped.
I knew you wouldn't leave without me.
I was waiting for you.
Now we can make it, Mac.
I feel big as a damn mountain.
Oh, no!
I'm not going without you, Mac.
I wouldn't leave you here this way.
You're coming with me.
Let's go!

[418][443]{Y:i}I found myself in a dark forest,
[444][473]{Y:i}for the clear path was lost.
[474][505]{Y:i}I cannot well recount|how I entered the wood,
[506][544]{Y:i}so long had it been|since I abandoned the true way.
[558][593]{Y:i}How shall I say what a dreary|and horrid wood it was?
[594][636]{Y:i}So bitter to endurw that death itself|would be but little worse.
[674][693]{Y:i}Several times upon my journey home,
[694][725]{Y:i}I had sensed an unseen rider|trailing my steed.
[727][760]{Y:i}Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished,
[772][791]{Y:i}leaving no trace.
[803][830]{Y:i}I feared this figure as an evil omen.
[831][871]{Y:i}All my life I've known such signs|and portents.
[921][957]{Y:i}And lo, at the rise of the hill,|I saw a spotted leopard,

[1078][1095]{Y:i}Away, demon!
[1200][1234]{Y:i}I drove my steed on,|racing for my father's villa.
[1235][1274]{Y:i}And Beatrice... nothing in this world|meant more to me than she.
[1283][1298]You were right, Dante.
[1299][1334]Truly this is a divine place.|Paradise on Earth.
[1336][1366]Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage,
[1368][1389]under God and all that is holy?
[1394][1444]Dante, I will not marry you|only to see you dead in this crusade.
[1445][1474]Jerusalem must be made Christian|once more.
[1475][1496]God is with us. We cannot fail.
[1519][1544]Through three years of war and horror,
[1545][1574]my love for Beatrice|had only grown stronger.
[1605][1627]As I came upon the family estate,
[1628][1659]I found all unnaturally dark and still.
[1705][1737]Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.
[1854][1881]The servants. All butchered.
[1982][2012]Father. Oh, Father.
[2021][2056]Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!
[2090][2110]In the name of God.
[2133][2149]Where is...
[2150][2169]Oh, no. No.
[2170][2190]Beloved, are you all right?
[2233][2251]Beatrice.
[2259][2288]Is it you or a dream?
[2301][2314]Who did this to you?
[2316][2330]I know not.
[2331][2363]A stranger. A foreigner.
[2386][2433]Do you remember that night|before you left?
[2434][2446]What we said?
[2447][2458]I remember.
[2459][2496]Did you betray me?
[2522][2540]Never.
[2631][2654]I never should have left your side.
[2656][2674]Forgive me.
[2715][2736]What?
[2772][2800]Do my eyes deceive me?
[2801][2842]Fear not for me, my love.|I told him you would be true to me.
[2852][2870]I knew you would.
[2917][2945]No! Wait! Come back to me!
[2976][2995]What is this?
[3031][3046]God in Heaven!
[3048][3067]What? Dante?
[3068][3093]She is mine.
[3094][3111]No!
[3118][3156]I have come to take|what was promised me...
[3158][3197]a soul meant for Heaven.
[3203][3218]It can't be true.
[3219][3240]Dante would never betray me.
[3252][3265]Beatrice!
[3267][3287]Release her, devil!
[3393][3413]Dante, help me!
[3424][3440]No!
[3538][3577]This will not stop me!|Nothing will stop me!
[3632][3644]No!
[3745][3762]What?
[3763][3780]No!
[3781][3807]God, give me strength!
[3834][3876]Come with me, mortal,|if you have the courage.
[3877][3909]Dante, don't let him take me!
[3917][3934]Beatrice!
[3976][4018]You will not keep me from my beloved!
[4088][4129]Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!
[4130][4170]You've got to save me! Dante!
[4200][4235]I'm coming for you!|I won't let him hurt you!
[4236][4277]Beatrice! No!
[4356][4387]- Martyr.|- You lost her.
[4388][4416]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4417][4427]You lost her.
[4428][4450]Never will you know her flesh again.
[4452][4500]Never will you know her love.
[4502][4511]Her sin.
[4512][4536]- Martyr. Martyr.|- You lost her!
[4537][4561]- Her desire.|- You lied to her.
[4562][4586]- Your sins.|- Never will you know her flesh again.
[4608][4623]Your sins.
[4624][4648]Never will you know her flesh.
[4649][4669]You are bound.
[4670][4706]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4707][4731]- Martyr.|- Martyr.
[4748][4783]Why, God?|Why are you doing this?
[4796][4830]It is not the Lord that brought you|to this fate, Dante.
[4854][4880]What are you? Shade or living man?
[4882][4912]Not man, though once I was.
[4913][4952]I lived under Augustus in the time|of the false and lying gods.
[4953][4984]Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?
[4985][5013]He who wrote the Aeneid,|the treasure of Rome?
[5014][5038]Why do you seek such woe, Dante?
[5039][5067]I seek only my beloved Beatrice|and nothing more.
[5068][5103]But I cannot open these accursed gates!
[5117][5147]Have you lost all faith in God, O man?
[5148][5171]Has the way been so obscured?
[5194][5226]Heavenly Father,|if only one soul should be saved,
[5227][5252]please let it be Beatrice.
[5281][5308]Help! Help!
[5373][5423]Dante, if you broke your promise to me,|I'll be forever damned.
[5425][5468]Are you prepared to be judged in this place?
[5469][5501]Do you think you are without sin?
[5503][5528]Please, don't let him take me!
[5529][5568]Beatrice. Beatrice!
[5911][5946]What did Beatrice do|to deserve such a monstrous fate?
[5948][5986]She made a wager with Lucifer|to see your safe return.
[5987][5998]She lost.
[6000][6017]Wager. What wager?
[6018][6046]Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.
[6048][6066]I never betrayed her.
[6067][6095]You only deceive yourself, mortal.
[6096][6140]By all that is holy, I vow to forsake|all pleasures of the flesh
[6141][6165]until I return from this noble crusade.
[6166][6211]I gave myself to you because I know|you will be faithful to our love.
[6225][6257]And when I return, we shall be married.
[6258][6291]And live to grow old and see|our grandchildren have children.
[6331][6361]I love you more than Heaven itself.
[6394][6413]- Take this.|- But, Beatrice,
[6414][6443]this has been in your family|for generations.
[6449][6463]It is a true relic
[6464][6495]said to contain a thorn|from the crown of Christ.
[6496][6514]Bring it back to me.
[6560][6585]Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.
[6587][6606]I beg of you, please!
[6607][6643]I must save Beatrice|even if it means my death.
[6644][6694]I will guide you, but you must put aside|all division of spirit
[6695][6723]and gather your soul against all fear.
[6738][6755]I fear nothing.
[6756][6772]Then proceed.
[6828][6871]Charon will carry us|to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.
[6873][6897]Nine circles comprise the Inferno,
[6899][6922]with Lucifer residing in the lowest.
[6928][6944]Horrifying, yes.
[6946][6962]There are more damned in Hell...
[6964][6986]than liberated in Paradise.
[6997][7022]I can see their sins in life.
[7050][7087]Charon's boat has grown wide|and mighty over the millennia.
[7088][7123]He has had to compensate|for the ever-increasing damned.
[7125][7160]Through me the way to the city of woe.
[7161][7202]Through me the way to everlasting pain.
[7203][7217]I don't like the look of this.
[7218][7249]Now shall I ferry you into the fire,
[7250][7286]the cold and the everlasting darkness.
[7287][7326]Abandon hope,|all ye who enter here.
[7327][7346]How could God allow this?
[7347][7382]God allowed free will, even for his angels.
[7384][7417]It was Lucifer that devised such torment.
[7418][7439]Mercenaries of Florentina,
[7440][7466]in payment for reclaiming|the Holy Land,
[7467][7522]your Immaculate Father hereby|absolves you of all your sins.
[7523][7543]Go with grace.
[7575][7588]Praise God.
[7601][7630]Do you think a priest|has such divine power?
[7631][7656]Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?
[7657][7671]Of course, Francesco.
[7672][7713]Why would you doubt the Church?|That is the path to Hell, my friend.
[7714][7731]How soon until you leave?
[7732][7758]Tomorrow, before dawn.
[7759][7790]Dante, promise to watch over my brother.
[7791][7815]Beatrice, I'm no child.
[7823][7845]No harm will come to him, my love.
[7846][7867]I'll protect him as if he were my own.
[7886][7910]You who are living,
[7911][7945]be gone from those who are dead.
[7946][7965]I will not part, Charon!
[7966][7990]I must cross!
[7992][8018]I give you my soul to find Beatrice!
[8019][8060]It belongs to us already, mortal.
[8529][8556]Your will is nothing, mortal.
[8557][8593]You will never traverse the circles of Hell.
[8617][8639]Take me to Beatrice, demon!
[8972][8995]Virgil, where did you disappear to?
[8999][9019]I am pure spirit, Dante.
[9020][9057]I cannot help you fight your enemies.|I am naught but a guide.
[9303][9346]Dante! Can you hear me?
[9356][9384]Can anyone hear me?
[9435][9456]Dante?
[9457][9487]Thank God.|I knew you would find me.
[9489][9503]Dante?
[9505][9535]Beatrice, my love.
[9537][9557]Is... Is that you?
[9610][9634]No! Dante!
[9635][9660]No, stop! Stop, Dante!
[9779][9801]What's happening?
[9803][9834]How many ways can a man die?
[9835][9846]No!
[9847][9871]Come to me, Beatrice.
[9879][9914]- I want to admire you.|- No. Let me go.
[9915][9954]There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.
[9963][9995]There are untold pleasures here,
[9996][10051]pleasures your human senses|could not fathom.
[10052][10066]Never!
[10206][10263]There is nothing you can do|to hurt me, child.
[10268][10322]What you perceive of me is a literal shadow|of my former self,
[10324][10349]but you...
[10362][10419]you can die a thousand deaths by my will.
[10496][10512]What?
[10543][10571]Think of the tortures I can create
[10572][10624]for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.
[10694][10721]Tell me more about your life on Earth,|great poet.
[10722][10749]I know your deeds,|but not the man you were.
[10750][10777]Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.
[10778][10798]I was the son of a commoner,
[10799][10833]and though I died a dozen years|before the birth of Christ,
[10834][10857]I foretold his coming in my works.
[10858][10880]What is this place, Virgil?
[10881][10914]The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.
[10920][10942]Here suffer those that did not sin,
[10943][10971]yet did not have the required faith.
[10972][11019]This is the realm where virtuous pagans|and unbaptized babies reside.
[11094][11122]A child? Here?
[11123][11143]How can this be?
[11157][11175]Dearest Dante.
[11177][11225]This is the fourth letter I have written|and the fourth I have destroyed.
[11227][11256]I am five months with child.
[11265][11296]I fear telling your father|as we have yet to be married.
[11305][11343]I do not know how much longer|I can conceal my state.
[11344][11377]All I ask is that you return to me soon.
[11378][11412]Leave this terrible crusade,
[11413][11449]and we... we can be married.
[11536][11555]My lady, what is it?
[11556][11579]The baby.
[11719][11748]This is my son.
[11801][11834]Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.
[11845][11881]Come. Quickly, Dante.|This is not a place to contemplate.
[11918][11942]What madness is this?
[12116][12142]Lord, too many.
[12220][12236]Virgil. Virgil!
[12237][12256]In here, Dante. Hurry.
[12447][12475]What is that sound?|More demons?
[12477][12495]No.
[12575][12598]They are familiar to me.
[12599][12632]The great rulers and philosophers|of the golden age.
[12633][12659]Is that not Hector and Electra?
[12660][12679]Caesar and King Latinus?
[12680][12704]And do not forget Plato,|Socrates and Aristotle.
[12706][12722]I have never agreed to such terms.
[12724][12771]I say that God exists in the realm of ideas,|accessible to human thought.
[12772][12834]Plato, there is only one philosophy|in the Inferno - Lucifer's.
[12835][12875]Do not look for liberation here, old friend.
[12887][12913]- Do you know this shade?|- He was Saladin,
[12914][12931]a noble Kurdish sultan.
[12933][12975]I fought his forces in the Crusades|under Richard the Lionheart.
[13032][13065]Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.
[13084][13121]We will wash these holy lands|in your heathen blood.
[13128][13142]Father...
[13154][13184]Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.
[13185][13227]Dante! Dante, the forces|of Saladin arw routed!
[13229][13247]Dante?
[13615][13637]My God, what is it?
[13638][13657]He is King Minos.
[13658][13679]Once a king of Crete
[13680][13714]before Daedalus|boiled him in his own bath.
[13715][13751]Now, Minos foreverjudges the damned,
[13753][13780]sending them to their circle below.
[13790][13807]- Through him...|- Traitor.
[13808][13828]...all must pass.
[13829][13846]Heretic.
[13857][13875]Glutton.
[13883][13902]Hoarder.
[13903][13921]Suicide!
[13940][13973]Who comes into my house of pain?
[13974][14012]He who seeks Beatrice.|Let me pass, that I may find her.
[14039][14090]Turn back.|There is no place for you here.
[14091][14122]Not yet, O mortal.
[14123][14160]With your permission or not,|I pass, monster.
[14162][14202]You dare so speak|to the judge of the damned?
[14258][14274]I dare.
[14555][14596]I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.
[14613][14648]Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!
[14650][14688]Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.
[15027][15048]Here you must descend.
[15096][15118]The damned are trying to flee.
[15119][15142]Lucifer will not be pleased.
[15152][15186]Let him come.|If these demons can die in the Inferno,
[15187][15208]then so can he.
[15426][15442]What is this place?
[15443][15477]This is the second circle,|the circle of Lust.
[15478][15510]To this torment are condemned|the carnal damned.
[15511][15531]They are the great lustful of the world.
[15532][15590]See there Semiramis and Ninus,|Anthony and Cleopatra,
[15591][15615]Helen of Troy and Paris.
[15616][15642]The storms of lust forever rage
[15643][15666]while passion inflames the heart.
[15692][15727]Listen, on the wind.
[15729][15756]- Dante, help me.|- Beatrice!
[15757][15775]Please, Dante.
[15777][15793]Dante.
[15795][15820]- Beatrice!|- Dante, hold.
[15821][15840]Beatrice!
[15856][15890]A new visitor arrives, sisters.
[15910][15944]Come, embrace us, Dante.
[15946][15988]We know what you want.|We can see it in your eyes.
[15990][16016]Unbearable lust.
[16027][16059]No, let me pass.|Stand aside, harlot.
[16064][16104]If you won't have us, we shall have you!
[16416][16438]Dante, how could you let this happen?
[16439][16455]How could you betray me?
[16456][16476]No, Beatrice. I swear.
[16478][16502]What do you swear, Dante?
[16503][16530]Do you want me to show her the truth?
[16531][16570]Serpent. It's all lies.|I never betrayed her.
[16572][16597]I'll kill you!
[16608][16665]You can hide from|neither memory nor sin, Dante.
[16705][16750]What? King Richard wants us|to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?
[16751][16767]That is his command?
[16773][16809]He will negotiate their exchange|for the rwturn of the true Cross.
[16810][16842]Negotiate with heretics?
[16843][16880]Never! They deserve only damnation.
[16910][16931]Get your hands off her.
[16941][16978]Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.
[17063][17101]Good and noble knights, have mercy.|I beg you!
[17102][17143]This prisoner only tried to save me|from the guards.
[17153][17193]Please, sir, show compassion.|He is no threat.
[17195][17224]He is a heretic.|He gets what he deserves.
[17257][17295]Kind lord, if you would show him mercy
[17296][17334]perhaps I could give you comfort in return.
[17335][17366]What comfort could you give|a soldier of God?
[17399][17431]The nights here are lonely and cold,|my lord,
[17432][17462]even for a soldier of God.
[17463][17481]Perhaps I could warm thee.
[17482][17509]Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.
[17510][17538]How is it a sin if I am already absolved?
[17540][17560]Guards, hold.
[17621][17651]Thank you, Lord. You are kind.
[17653][17676]I could see it in your eyes.
[17677][17701]And your promise of comfort?
[17790][17815]How could you do that to me...
[17816][17838]to us?
[17839][17865]I was weak. The war changed me.
[17867][17902]You know who I am inside.|We've known each other since childhood.
[17903][17929]Does she know you, Dante,
[17930][17968]or did the Crusades show her your true self?
[17973][18001]Beatrice! Forgive me!
[18016][18041]Please forgive me.
[18064][18111]No, it's not true.|He wouldn't do this to me.
[18112][18132]Dante!
[18134][18151]What did I say?
[18152][18187]Even the purest of souls|can be corrupted.
[18189][18223]Dante is not the man you once knew.
[18224][18265]You did this to him.|You corrupted his heart.
[18280][18309]I've had no need to influence humanity
[18310][18338]for many millennia, my dear.
[18340][18377]I simply introduced sin.
[18378][18421]Man is the one who has spread it|like a disease,
[18423][18461]cultivating it, empowering it.
[18583][18617]It is not our fault, none of it.
[18619][18637]Man is good.
[18638][18667]No, you don't understand.
[18668][18703]The Earth is another form of Hell,
[18705][18735]and men are its demons.
[18800][18829]I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.
[18830][18865]I could blame the Crusades,|but I know it was my own weakness,
[18866][18881]my own sin.
[18882][18921]Have you considered she is not|the only soul you are here to save?
[18942][18969]I seek only my beloved Beatrice,
[18970][18988]and nothing more.
[19013][19027]It is Cerberus,
[19029][19069]guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.
[19206][19246]That is the foulest fate|one could ever imagine.
[19248][19286]And it is your fate as well,|for the true circle of Gluttony
[19288][19316]lies inside of Cerberus's body.
[19318][19365]Inside? Good Lord, isn't there|perhaps a way around it?
[19366][19401]No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.
[19402][19438]So be it! For her I will conquer even this.
[19439][19460]Face me, wretched creature!
[19500][19521]Release me, demon!
[19704][19746]Hell can get no more horrible|than this place.
[19747][19774]I find this circle most unpleasant.
[19775][19799]You're a shade.|You should try wearing skin.
[19801][19822]Such a fate. Look at them all.
[19823][19861]How could such harmless sin|provoke such everlasting torment?
[19862][19899]The gluttons -|what they could not satisfy in life,
[19900][19930]in death they shall be denied for eternity.
[19932][19963]Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?
[19964][20003]I too am from Florence.|You were born before I died.
[20004][20022]I do not know you, spirit.
[20023][20055]You know me. I am Ciacco.
[20056][20074]Gluttony was my offense,
[20075][20110]and here I remain|mere skin and bones.
[20111][20146]Can you help me,|free me from this agony?
[20147][20161]Please, please.
[20162][20207]Your suffering weighs heavy|on my heart, spirit. Be free.
[20356][20367]Virgil, what's happening?
[20368][20399]How dare you free the damned?
[20400][20450]They deserve torment for wasting|their fleeting precious lives.
[20451][20479]And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?
[20480][20501]She is the exception.
[20502][20547]A pure soul to remind me|of my place in Heaven,
[20548][20587]to remind me of the light of my father.
[20596][20621]But let me ask you, Dante,
[20622][20652]what of your father?
[20663][20689]Beatrice, you must eat.
[20690][20709]I have no appetite.
[20711][20732]I know you miss my son,
[20734][20767]but you must keep up|your constitution, child.
[20768][20790]You're nothing but bone.
[20791][20822]It's unappealing for a lady.
[20840][20870]Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?
[20919][20945]It's just another memory, Dante.
[20956][20979]Your father's memory.
[20981][21021]- My father?|- He is here with us, Dante.
[21022][21043]Would you like to visit him?
[21146][21175]Do these tortures never end?
[21196][21214]Virgil, Beatrice is not here.
[21215][21236]We must escape this beast!
[21293][21319]What is this?
[21328][21367]Cerberus's black heart.|Destroy it, quickly.
[21663][21681]Beatrice!
[21986][22018]More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.
[22019][22048]What could one man do|with so much treasure?
[22059][22097]This is the fourth circle - Grwed.
[22270][22308]All the Earth's treasure|that is beneath the moon or ever was
[22309][22337]cannot give relief to these weary souls.
[22397][22432]What a mockery is made|of the brief battle for possessions
[22433][22451]that makes so short a life.
[22452][22481]These damned remind me of my father.
[22604][22644]What? Where are my last three coins?
[22645][22664]Dante?
[22676][22691]Dante!
[22709][22724]Bella!
[22741][22757]Yes, husband.
[22759][22787]I'm short three crowns.
[22788][22812]Are you stealing from me, woman?
[22814][22847]No, Alighiero,|I would never do such a thing.
[22865][22879]Liar!
[22922][22942]I knew I'd have to watch you.
[22943][22965]Now, tell me where|you've hidden it, woman,
[22967][22995]before I throttle you dead.
[23025][23048]Don't hit her! Mother!
[23190][23216]Can you believe that in my youth|I wanted to be a poet?
[23217][23241]But all I ever knew was violence.
[23242][23260]And what became of your mother?
[23262][23283]She died of a fever a year later.
[23284][23305]It was sudden and terrible.
[23322][23363]There is no room to pity the dead here, son.
[23365][23411]Lucifer did not lie, but then again|how could you not be here, Father?
[23418][23446]You think you're a greater man than me?
[23447][23476]That you're above reproach for your sins?
[23477][23513]I took up the Crusade.|The priest absolved us.
[23519][23545]And you actually believed him?
[23546][23573]No man can absolve you of your sins,
[23574][23612]but some men can be rewarded in Hell.
[23717][23747]Lucifer offered me a thousand years|free of torture
[23748][23792]and endless gold|if I would slay my own son.
[23797][23817]And where will you spend this gold, Father?
[23818][23848]Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.
[23899][23914]So be it.
[24071][24094]I always despised you.
[24113][24137]But you became me, son.
[24139][24171]You belong here. You always have.
[24216][24249]So I can be damned in Hell with you?|Never!
[24336][24376]It's time to claim my prize, boy.
[24377][24395]Then claim it.
[24545][24570]You want gold, Father?
[24571][24586]It's yours.
[24648][24676]I cannot go on.
[24677][24693]You must, Dante.
[24694][24727]Steel yourself.|The journey is not half over.
[24728][24775]How do I know you're not|another enemy sent by Lucifer?
[24776][24800]You could be luring me|to my doom all along.
[24801][24823]Another trick, another deception.
[24824][24843]Search inside yourself.
[24844][24872]You know I was sent here from on high.
[24874][24892]Forgive me, Virgil.
[24893][24922]This place has affected my mind.|Let us move on.
[24993][25033]Please, Lord.|Forgive me of my transgressions.
[25034][25060]Save me from this horrible torment.
[25061][25093]Please, I beg of you.
[25138][25158]My God.
[25159][25196]I have heard your prayers,|beloved Beatrice,
[25198][25219]and I have come for you.
[25234][25268]There is no escape, little soul.
[25269][25299]Your prayers are worthless here.
[25408][25427]Rejoice, child,
[25428][25475]for you are about to be granted|a rare privilege in the Inferno.
[25485][25516]I am making you my bride.
[25525][25558]You will become the Queen of Hell.
[25570][25592]Are you not pleased?
[25712][25753]I cannot stand this wretched place.
[25754][25789]For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.
[25790][25817]The very air reeks of fury.
[25819][25842]Watch your ankles.
[25882][25912]More food! We're starving!
[25948][25964]We need more food.
[25989][26011]We're doing the best we can.
[26013][26048]There isn't enough food to go around.|Quiet! Quiet down!
[26049][26071]There is nothing we can do.
[26072][26092]The granaries are ablaze.
[26093][26114]We barely have enough rations|for our own men.
[26115][26153]Then I'm leaving this post.|I will not put up with guard duty any longer.
[26154][26176]You can't do that, Dante.
[26177][26207]We came here to kill these heretics,|not coddle them.
[26208][26230]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[26231][26269]Saladin took the city last year|and spared Christian lives.
[26270][26280]We should do the same.
[26281][26309]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[26310][26328]Enough. Enough!
[26438][26480]Keep your mind, Dante.|Do not dwell on past deeds here.
[26500][26529]See the souls over whom|anger has prevailed.
[26538][26583]In the black sludge of the River Styx|do they wish they had never been born.
[26584][26619]The fools. It is here we must cross.
[26705][26724]We travel in that?
[26725][26749]Perhaps we would be safer swimming.
[26818][26845]I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.
[26846][26873]Is this a friend of yours, great poet?
[26874][26902]Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.
[26904][26929]He was the son of Ares|and a king in his day.
[26931][26966]Hold on.|The ride will be somewhat bumpy.
[26975][27009]The angry souls know no end to their fury.
[27010][27055]Who are you that comes here|before your time?
[27056][27076]If I come, I do not remain.
[27077][27111]But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.
[27112][27129]You were Filippo Argenti in life.
[27130][27174]Come down, Dante,|and face your old enemy!
[27176][27211]Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.
[27400][27438]Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near,
[27440][27465]housing its solemn citizens within.
[27486][27534]Damned of Dis rejoice,|for your lord, Lucifer,
[27535][27570]is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.
[27571][27623]Truly this will be a marriage|of Heaven and Hell.
[27624][27653]Hurry, Phlegias! Run!
[27721][27733]Beatrice!
[27773][27813]Outcasts of Heaven, race despised,
[27814][27857]why do you rail against a will|that cannot be stopped?
[27866][27883]Dante?
[28096][28128]He has taken her into the tombs.|Hurry, Dante.
[28178][28230]Gone. Why does he do this?|Bait us on? Keep us running?
[28232][28267]Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul|as well as Beatrice's.
[28269][28293]He's luring us to the ninth circle.
[28305][28340]- What is this place?|- The tombs of heresy.
[28342][28375]Here in the sixth circle|you will find endless heretics
[28376][28397]burning in eternal fire.
[28410][28465]O Tuscan, who walks through this place|speaking so decorously,
[28466][28498]know that I am Farinata.
[28499][28548]Farinata, another hated man in life.|What do you want, spirit?
[28549][28562]Know this.
[28564][28608]The damned can foresee the future|but can never know the present.
[28609][28663]Your future, Dante,|is filled with death and destruction.
[28664][28703]Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell,
[28705][28751]and you will be damned with us forever.
[28845][28864]I never liked him.
[28873][28887]What's happening?
[28888][28904]The harrowing of Hell.
[28905][28930]Christ's death forever quakes this circle.
[28931][28948]We must hurry.
[28972][29008]Let me go. What do you want from me?
[29009][29042]I have taken countless brides|over the millennia -
[29043][29083]Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.
[29085][29140]But, unlike them,|your spirit is pure, unspoiled.
[29141][29161]I will never succumb to you.
[29162][29178]Kill me again and again,
[29179][29221]slit my throat, tear me to pieces,|but I will never love you.
[29261][29287]Yes, such passion.
[29288][29311]You have a fire inside you.
[29313][29331]After we are properly married,
[29332][29373]you will give me a brood|to carry on my legacy.
[29374][29429]You will be birthing my children for eternity,|sweet soul.
[29445][29471]Virgil, do you hear...
[29547][29582]Who is this new monster?|What does he want?
[29583][29615]The minotaur guards passage|into the seventh circle.
[29616][29631]Be cautious, Dante.
[29643][29660]How dare you threaten us?
[29661][29697]Do you think he is the duke of Athens|who served up your death above?
[29698][29731]Off with you.|Begone, abomination!
[29733][29752]Virgil, I think you've made him angry.
[29753][29773]Now, while he is blind with rage.
[29774][29799]Hold fast. Steady.
[29800][29816]Now move!
[29894][29916]You have many surprises, poet.
[29917][29950]Perhaps you would have made|a great warrior in life.
[29951][29990]It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.
[30073][30100]This circle is reserved for the violent.
[30101][30124]Those who have done violence|against others
[30126][30153]forever boil in the blood they have shed.
[30169][30188]How shall we cross?
[30189][30210]It's impossible.
[30247][30266]You summoned me, great Virgil.
[30267][30285]Greetings, Nessus.
[30287][30327]We need passage across the bloody|Phlegethon. Can you help us?
[30328][30358]Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.
[30376][30395]The river is treacherous.
[30412][30449]Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila,
[30450][30472]and countless others.
[30480][30512]The damned here|are worse off than the Styx.
[30513][30556]These were the kings of bloodshed|and despoilment.
[30727][30757]Be wary of the next passage, friends.
[30758][30778]My thanks, Nessus.
[30780][30806]Good luck to you, mortal soul.
[30833][30868]We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.
[30910][30938]This is no forest.
[30939][30973]Yes, they are those who did violence|to themselves.
[30975][31002]- This is the wood of suicide.|- Dante...
[31004][31028]- No, my friend! Turn back!|- Come to me, Dante.
[31029][31056]Come to me, Dante.
[31058][31081]Come to me.
[31083][31127]Why do you break me?|Have you no pity?
[31128][31141]Mother?
[31142][31158]Yes, son.
[31159][31186]I too am among the damned.
[31187][31210]But how can this be?
[31217][31237]When a soul takes its own life,
[31238][31261]Minos judges it to this circle.
[31263][31293]Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.
[31294][31317]No body, only pain.
[31318][31351]No, Mother, you don't belong here.
[31352][31368]You died of fever.
[31377][31401]Her heart gave out from the fever.
[31402][31427]She was just too fragile.
[31428][31447]Where is she now, Father?
[31448][31502]In Paradise, son,|with all the souls of pure light.
[31507][31531]I despised your father's cruelty,
[31532][31559]but I was too weak to defy him.
[31561][31585]And so, I...
[31586][31601]I took my...
[31617][31664]You learned your father's ways,|but you are not lost.
[31665][31690]You can redeem yourself.
[31692][31735]Beatrice was all I had.|How could I have betrayed her?
[31737][31776]The pain you endure purifies you, son.
[31778][31839]Heed my words. You must look|into your deepest sin to save her.
[31849][31868]And what of you?
[31869][31919]Only the living can redeem themselves.|I cannot.
[31920][31952]This is too cruel a punishment|for you, Mother.
[31954][31997]God must know this is not your fault.|I'm going to free you.
[32080][32116]My soul belongs to God now, son.
[32275][32300]We are still in the seventh circle?
[32301][32328]Yes, the Abominable Sands.
[32329][32368]It is here the damned|did violence against God.
[32404][32436]We came here to kill these heretics.
[32437][32460]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[32461][32506]Saladin took the city last year and spared|Christian lives. We should do the same.
[32507][32542]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[32543][32561]Enough. Enough!
[32573][32588]Dante, no!
[32730][32746]Fight with me, Crusaders.
[32747][32768]Spill the blood of these heathens.
[32769][32797]Their souls are already lost.
[32804][32831]Dante, what have you done?
[33083][33106]Crusaders? Herw?
[33107][33124]Why are you being punished?
[33125][33156]Our cause was holy.|We are absolved of sin.
[33185][33238]The bishop lied, did he not, brother?
[33239][33268]Francesco, not you too.
[33269][33295]God never condones violence of any kind.
[33296][33327]There was no holy war.|Don't you understand?
[33328][33348]The priests lied.
[33349][33379]Of all people, how could you be here?
[33385][33408]It was you! You did this to me!
[33410][33428]No, no, no, listen.
[33429][33466]You don't deserve the life given to you,
[33467][33490]you don't deserve Beatrice,
[33491][33529]and now you will join us here forever|where you belong.
[33591][33601]Brother.
[33664][33685]I am not your brother.
[33687][33721]You're an animal, Dante.|A monster!
[33747][33770]I will not let you have her.
[33915][33946]You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.
[34157][34197]It's over. Justice is inevitable.
[34200][34220]Not yet.
[34595][34616]He can rest for a while,
[34618][34669]but he is forever bound here|like a shadow of time unforgotten.
[34671][34697]He was a good man.
[34698][34722]He doesn't deserve such suffering.
[34723][34765]Heavenly Father,|let the soul of Francesco rise
[34766][34791]into your divine Paradise.
[34812][34827]What?
[34844][34876]Pray for your own soul, Dante,
[34877][34919]for it will freeze with me forever|in Cocytus below.
[34920][34946]I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.
[34947][34973]Yes, a contest.
[34974][35025]Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice|is soon my queen.
[35144][35174]This is the union|of the three great rivers of Hell.
[35294][35316]Another beast I must slay?
[35330][35367]No, Dante. Geryon is our passage|to the eighth circle.
[35372][35407]Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.
[35517][35533]My thanks, Geryon.
[35534][35554]This way, Dante.
[35573][35595]We are in the circle of Fraud
[35596][35630]which one commits|upon those who trust in him.
[35669][35694]You must travel these ten malebolge alone.
[35695][35722]And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.
[35723][35757]Alone? What of you, great poet?
[35759][35778]I will not be far, believe me.
[35780][35798]You have proven yourself worthy.
[35800][35845]Now hurry, Dante,|lest you lose your love forever.
[35868][35902]I traveled on alone,|over the flatterers and simonists,
[35903][35933]and as I ran I was overwhelmed|with my sins
[35934][35966]as if every malebolge|was a chasm of memory.
[35967][35992]I felt my mind weakening with every step,
[35993][36018]and yet I would not cease.
[36069][36106]Release that one.|His ransom has been paid.
[36117][36131]My ransom?
[36132][36169]No. No, you didn't...
[36170][36199]You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?
[36200][36230]Didn't you? You whore.
[36231][36249]You have shamed me.
[36250][36267]You are not my wife, do you hear?
[36268][36293]Filthy whore. Whore!
[36318][36352]I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.
[36353][36373]I swear I'll kill you.
[36394][36444]You bastard. You'll see everyone|you ever loved dead by my hand.
[36446][36466]Dead, dead!
[36479][36507]No, it can't be.
[36618][36639]I have come for the woman.
[36640][36654]No!
[36685][36717]Leave her alone. She's innocent.
[36718][36738]Run, Beatrice, run!
[36748][36771]Get out of my house, filthy dog.
[36850][36881]- Get away from me!|- There is no escape for you.
[36882][36903]Stay back.
[36921][36937]No!
[37076][37105]Vengeance is finally mine.
[37148][37184]It was me. Beatrice's death.
[37185][37208]They were all murdered because of me.
[37209][37249]At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.
[37251][37286]You are the true cause of|Beatrice's suffering,
[37287][37320]and the damnation of so many others.
[37321][37348]How could you have done such evil to me?
[37349][37390]Tear the heart from my chest,|rip the very soul from my body?
[37392][37423]These sins are my own.
[37425][37446]You have no right to Beatrice.
[37447][37466]Relinquish her.
[37520][37553]Never! Dwellers, night fiends,
[37554][37574]and torturers of the pit,
[37575][37611]strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.
[37612][37628]Lucifer!
[37772][37804]Beatrice, stop!|You don't know what you're doing!
[37814][37832]I thought I knew many things.
[37833][37882]I thought love was real,|but it was only an illusion, a fraud.
[37883][37920]There is nothing left for me|in all of God's crwation.
[37973][37988]Yes, my love.
[37989][38025]In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.
[38026][38050]Beatrice, don't do it!
[38084][38127]When you had your way with that girl,|you gave me to Lucifer.
[38128][38151]It was all because of you.
[38168][38183]Beatrice!
[38227][38241]No!
[38242][38262]No, no.
[38289][38320]The faithful has lost her faith.
[38321][38357]The incorruptible|has become corrupted.
[38358][38406]The true innocent has given way|to the sins of man,
[38407][38436]like all the rest before her.
[38437][38475]Who can now deny me my rights?
[38570][38602]I will leave you with my consort.
[38616][38648]She has so much to show you.
[38754][38784]This is where you belong, Dante.
[38785][38812]You are the greatest fraud of all.
[38813][38839]You've lied to me, deceived me,
[38840][38875]and for that you shall suffer.
[38896][38916]Beatrice, don't do this.
[38992][39009]You never loved me.
[39010][39030]It was all a lie, all of it...
[39031][39052]our whole life!
[39114][39158]Beatrice, listen to me.|I braved the circles of Hell for you.
[39159][39184]You mean nothing to me.
[39185][39229]But I have faced my sins.|I am ready to take you home.
[39230][39266]Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.
[39267][39293]Look deep into the ninth circle...
[39328][39351]the circle of traitors.
[39411][39444]God in Heaven, what happened?
[39445][39486]Who is responsible|for this massacre?
[39505][39542]Take care of my sister.|I am responsible.
[39564][39608]Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.
[39610][39660]When the noble Saladin|learns of this atrocity
[39661][39691]he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.
[39701][39720]Take care of Beatrice.
[39721][39747]Dante, protect her with your life.
[39816][39842]Beatrice, I'm coming home.
[39897][39934]I wanted nothing more|than to see you and beg for forgiveness.
[39935][39972]I will never forgive what you've done, never.
[39977][40007]But while I live, I can absolve you.
[40008][40041]Forgive me, and free yourself.
[40050][40073]My cross.
[40074][40098]I brought it back to you.
[40099][40131]Accept again the love of God.
[40265][40282]Dante.
[40339][40357]I forgive you.
[40358][40397]I never wanted any harm to come to you.
[40488][40515]You have done well, my friend.
[40516][40547]And though you may not|understand it now, Dante,
[40548][40601]you have perhaps saved far more|than just one innocent soul.
[40637][40677]Wait. I can't be separated from her now.|I've come this far.
[40679][40709]You cannot claim|a place with her yet, Dante.
[40716][40760]You have to face the true enemy,|in the lowest part of the ninth circle...
[40761][40781]the circle of traitors.
[40782][40831]There, you must face the king of traitors,|Lucifer himself.
[40832][40865]He guards your only escape|from the Inferno.
[40873][40914]We shall be reunited one day. I promise.
[40927][40942]Goodbye, my love.
[40971][41009]This last trial is for you to face alone.
[41020][41039]Godspeed, my friend.
[41047][41084]Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.
[41086][41113]I will make you pay for her suffering.
[41121][41142]I am coming for you.
[41261][41286]I fell, not into fire,
[41315][41346]but into a vast, frozen wasteland.
[41360][41382]The very center of Hell,
[41407][41429]furthest place in all of creation
[41430][41454]from the divine light of God.
[41474][41520]Treachery, the ninth circle|of the Inferno.
[41595][41642]I walked through the darkness,|numb with bitter cold.
[41671][41702]All about me were forsaken,
[41703][41753]frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.
[41811][41867]Who are you to walk the paths of Hell|so warmly, O living man?
[41868][41894]Damned soul, where is Lucifer?
[41896][41929]Tell me, before I too freeze|in this miserable hell.
[41930][41994]Wipe the icy tears from my eyes,|and I shall tell you.
[42085][42122]The Lord of Hell dwells|at the center of this frozen lake.
[42123][42142]Past the storms of Ptolomea,
[42143][42171]deep in the center pit of Judecca,
[42172][42197]there his icy halls are well protected,
[42198][42238]and none but the mightiest|may cleave a path.
[42239][42265]But can you believe me?
[42266][42287]Can you believe a traitor?
[42333][42374]Long did I wander|the dim and icy paths of Hell.
[42410][42436]Past the frozen giants of legend...
[42437][42482]Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.
[42499][42522]I was battered by a frigid wind
[42523][42560]that was like the beating|of Lucifer's black wings.
[42605][42641]Finally, after a seeming eternity,
[42642][42700]I came to a passage blocked|by the frozen links of a mighty chain.
[42723][42753]Lucifer thinks he can block my way|with this?
[42754][42782]He thinks he can stay my vengeance?
[43132][43164]Welcome, great Dante.
[43165][43205]Welcome to your final resting place,
[43206][43226]the circle of traitors.
[43227][43257]Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell
[43259][43282]so that I may be reunited with my beloved,
[43284][43313]but not before I rid the world|of your corruption.
[43315][43343]You will never see Beatrice again.
[43344][43375]The path to Purgatory lies through me.
[43377][43416]You are the warrior|of a weak and dying God,
[43418][43441]a God who is the true evil.
[43442][43470]His power wanes over the world.
[43471][43510]Silence. Your lies|have no power over me, Devil.
[43511][43552]I will rend the very soul|from your frozen body.
[43553][43575]Indignant fool.
[43576][43606]Come, let me devour your soul
[43607][43633]as I devoured Judas Iscariot.
[43634][43689]You will remain in this pit|until creation's last breath, do you hear?
[43690][43710]Never!
[43720][43746]You are not invincible here.
[43747][43772]You are just another demon
[43773][43814]and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.
[43830][43877]You cannot destroy me!
[44021][44048]What have you done to me?
[44149][44180]I have slain you, great beast.
[44181][44215]Victory is mine.
[44216][44234]What's this?
[44333][44358]New life writhes inside him.
[44359][44377]No!
[44461][44497]Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.
[44499][44531]Many have tried, but all have failed me.
[44532][44567]Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...
[44569][44605]Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.
[44614][44635]Minion? I do not serve you.
[44637][44666]Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!
[44675][44696]Do you not?
[44698][44737]You freed me|from my eternal torment.
[44738][44762]I came only for Beatrice.
[44763][44794]Beatrice? She was only bait.
[44795][44823]It was you I wanted all along.
[44824][44869]Don't you see?|I was bound by God in this frozen pit,
[44870][44904]only my shadow self allowed to roam free.
[44905][44947]It took a mortal to release me -|you, Dante.
[44954][44971]No, it isn't true!
[44972][44989]I defeated you before.
[44990][45031]Show me the path from Hell,|or I will end your miserable existence.
[45033][45058]Destroy an angel of God?
[45059][45080]You arrogant gnat.
[45082][45108]Such vanity, such pride.
[45110][45141]I could have slain you|the moment you fell into Hell.
[45247][45266]You worship God,
[45267][45295]but it was He who created evil.
[45297][45325]It was He who created me.
[45326][45371]If you knew the true nature of God, Dante,
[45372][45399]you too would rebel.
[45400][45412]No!
[45413][45455]You are nothing to me. A talking animal.
[45456][45483]He made you in His image...
[45507][45536]and I was to bow down to you?
[45688][45720]I grow weary of this game.
[46019][46069]Finally, I will reclaim|my proper place in Heaven.
[46072][46125]Behold, Dante.|Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory,
[46126][46156]where awaits your precious Beatrice.
[46157][46196]But instead of you,|I shall escape from this pit.
[46197][46240]All the souls in Purgatory|shall suffer and burn.
[46241][46300]And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.
[46302][46338]I will plunge the cosmos into chaos,
[46340][46370]and it is all your doing, Dante.
[46371][46435]Because of you, God will finally|see me rule His creation.
[46436][46474]No, I cannot be the cause of this.
[46476][46513]There is nothing you can do|to stop me, mortal.
[46514][46544]No one can stop me.
[46546][46566]One can.
[46608][46656]Almighty God, forgive me|for all of my wicked sins.
[46657][46700]I forsake my escape.|I give up even Beatrice.
[46701][46720]I belong here, in Hell,
[46721][46745]and accept my just damnation.
[46746][46776]What are you doing?
[46777][46817]A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!
[46818][46836]Do not utter a word!
[46837][46884]But grant me the power|to keep your enemy here with me.
[46895][46923]Stop. I command you.
[46924][46961]No!
[47351][47369]Purgatory.
[47629][47673]Beatrice. I will come to you yet.
[47674][47703]My love, I have forgiven you.
[47704][47754]God will forgive you.|Now forgive yourself.
[47843][47885]I fought across Earth and Hell|to find my beloved Beatrice.
[47899][47942]We were together,|neither in Hell nor in Paradise,
[47943][47974]neither damned nor saved.
[47975][48016]I did not die, and I did not live.

I don't understand...
I just don't understand.
I don't understand it at all.
I just don't understand.
What's wrong?
What don't you understand?
I've never heard such a strange story.
Why don't you tell me about it?
We happen to have a wise priest in our midst.
No, not even the renowned, wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple has heard a story as strange as this.
So you know something about this strange story?
This man and I have just seen it and heard it ourselves.
- Where?
- In the courthouse garden.
The courthouse?
A man was murdered.
Just one? So what?
On top of this gate, you'll find at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
You're right.
War, earthquake, winds, fire, famine, the plague...
Year after year, it's been nothing but disasters.
And bandits descend upon us every night.
I've seen so many men getting killed like insects, but even I have never heard a story as horrible as this.
Yes. So horrible.
This time, I may finally lose my faith in the human soul.
It's worse than bandits, the plague, famine, fire, or war.
Look here, priest.
Enough with the sermon.
It sounded interesting, at least while I kept out of the rain.
But if it's a sermon,
I'd sooner listen to the rain.
Hear me out. Maybe you can tell me what it means.
I don't understand any of those three.
- Which three?
- Well...
I'll tell you about them.
Calm down and tell me slowly.
The rain's not going to stop any time soon.
RASHOMON
It was three days ago.
I went into the mountains to get wood.
I ran as fast as I could to tell the police.
Then, three days later... today...
I was called to testify.
Yes. That's right.
I was the one who first found the body.
What? Did I see a sword or something?
No, nothing at all.
Just a woman's hat caught on a branch, and the cap of a samurai that had been trampled on.
There was a cut-up piece of rope near the body, and further along in the leaves, a shiny amulet case with red lining.
Yes.
That was all I found, yes.
Yes.
I met the murdered man before his death.
It was three days ago, in the afternoon.
On the road from Sekiyama to Yamashina.
The woman had a veil, so I couldn't see her face.
The man was armed with a sword, as well as a bow and arrows.
Little did I expect that he would meet such a fate.
A human life is truly as frail and fleeting as the morning dew.
What a shame that his should end this way.
I'm sorry.
This man I caught is Tajomaru.
Yes, the notorious bandit everyone speaks of.
The last time I almost caught him, he looked the same and he carried that same sword.
It was two days ago at dusk, by the banks of the Katsura...
What's wrong?
There were 17 arrows with eagle feathers,
a leather bow, and a horse.
All these belonged to the dead man, yes.
The irony of Tajomaru being thrown off his stolen horse, this had to be fateful retribution.
I fell off the horse?
You fool!
On that day...
I was riding that horse and I was suddenly very thirsty.
So around Osaka,
I drank from a spring.
There must have been a dead poisonous snake upstream.
After a while, I got an incredible stomachache.
By the time I came to the river,
I couldn't hold it any longer.
So I got off the horse and crouched in the field.
I fell off?
Obviously, a fool can think only foolish thoughts.
I know sooner or later you'll have my neck, so I'm not going to hide anything.
It was this Tajomaru who killed that man.
I saw that couple three days ago.
It was a hot afternoon.
Suddenly a cool breeze rustled the leaves.
If it hadn't been for that wind,
I wouldn't have killed him.
I caught a glimpse and then she was gone.
Maybe that's why.
I thought I saw a goddess.
At that moment I decided to capture her, even if I had to kill her man.
But if I could have her without killing, all the better.
My intention then was to take her without killing the man.
But I couldn't do it on that road to Yamashina.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What is it?
Don't be suspicious.
See? Isn't this nice?
Take a good look at it.
There are some ruins over there.
When I dug up the mound, I found a heap of swords and mirrors.
I buried them in a grove behind the mountain so no one else would find them.
If you're interested,
I'll sell them to you cheap.
It's over there.
Walk ahead of me.
It's here. Beyond those pines.
Your husband has taken sick.
Her face turned pale.
She stared at me with frozen eyes, her expression intense like a child's.
When I saw that, I envied the man and I suddenly hated him.
I wanted to show her how pathetic he looked tied to that pine tree.
These thoughts that weren't there before filled my head.
I had never seen such fierceness in a woman.
And so I had succeeded in having her without killing her husband.
I still had no intention of killing him.
But then...
Wait!
Stop!
Either you die or my husband dies.
One of you must die.
To have my shame known to two men is worse than dying.
I will go with the survivor.
So I had to kill him, but I wanted to do it honorably.
He fought very well.
We crossed swords 23 times.
I remember this because I'm still impressed.
No one had ever crossed swords with me more than 20 times.
What? The woman?
I don't know.
When the man died,
I turned to her. She was gone.
The fighting must have scared her and she ran away.
I ran out to the mountain road.
All I found was her horse grazing calmly.
I was attracted to her fierce spirit, but, after all, she was just like other women.
I didn't even look for her.
What? His sword?
I exchanged it in town for liquor.
What? Her dagger?
It had pearl inlay.
Looked very valuable.
I totally forgot about it.
That was foolish.
The biggest mistake I ever made!
Even amongst the bandits,
Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.
Why, last fall, a young wife went to the temple and she and her maid were found dead in the mountains.
That must have been him too.
Who knows what really happened to that woman who left her horse?
Well, that woman showed up at the courthouse.
She was hiding in the temple when the police found her.
It's a lie.
It's all a lie.
Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
It's human to lie.
Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.
That may be.
But it's because men are weak that they lie, even to themselves.
Not another sermon.
I don't care if it's a lie, as long as it's entertaining.
What story did the woman come up with?
Well, it's completely different from Tajomaru's story.
So different that her face didn't even show the fierceness he spoke of.
She was so docile, she was almost pitiful.
That man in the blue kimono, after forcing me to yield to him, proudly announced that he was the infamous Tajomaru, and laughed mockingly at my husband who was tied up.
How horrified my husband must have been.
The more he struggled, the tighter the ropes dug in.
I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.
Even now, when I think of his eyes, my blood turns cold in my veins.
What I saw in them was neither anger, nor sorrow, but a cold light, a look of loathing.
Don't.
Don't look at me like that.
It's too cruel.
Beat me, kill me, but don't look at me like that.
Please, stop.
Now kill me.
Kill me at once.
Stop.
Don't.
Please don't.
I must have fainted after that.
When I came to and looked around...
Imagine my shock.
I saw my dagger in my dead husband's chest.
I was in shock and I don't remember how I left the woods.
But when I came to,
I was standing by the pond, at the foot of the hill.
I threw myself into the pond.
I tried many different things.
But I failed to kill myself.
What should a poor, helpless woman like me do?
I see. The more I hear, the more confused I get.
But women use their tears to fool everyone.
They even fool themselves.
So you have to beware of the woman's story.
When you hear the dead man's story...
He's dead.
How can he tell his story?
He spoke through a medium.
Lies. His story was also lies.
But dead men don't lie.
Why is that?
I refuse to believe that man would be so sinful.
Suit yourself.
But is there anyone who's really good?
Maybe goodness is just make-believe.
What a frightening...
Man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff.
It's easier that way.
- Ridiculous.
Nevermind.
Let's hear the dead man's story.
I am in darkness now.
I am suffering in the dark.
Cursed be those who cast me into this dark hell.
After the bandit attacked my wife, he tried to console her.
She sat on the leaves, staring down at her knees.
The bandit was cunning.
Now that her virtue was stained,
she could no longer be with her husband.
Leave the husband and why not marry him instead?
He said he only attacked her out of his love for her.
When she heard that, my wife raised her face as if in a trance.
She had never looked so beautiful.
And what was my beautiful wife's response to the bandit
in front of her helpless husband?
Wherever.
Take me wherever you want.
That's what she said.
But that wasn't her only sin or I wouldn't be suffering in the dark like this.
Please kill him.
While he's alive,
I cannot go with you.
Kill him!
Those words were like a wind that threatened to blow me into the depths of darkness.
Has such a hateful thing ever been uttered by a human before?
Even the bandit turned pale at those words.
Please kill him.
What do you want me to do with her?
Kill her or save her?
You only have to nod.
For these words alone,
I was ready to pardon his crime.
Kill her or let her go?
I don't know how many hours passed.
She got away. Now I'll have to worry about my own fate.
Everything was silent.
I heard someone crying.
Someone is crying.
Who is that?
Everything was silent.
How quiet it was.
Suddenly the sun went away.
I was enveloped in deep silence.
I lay there in the stillness.
Then someone quietly approached me.
That someone gently withdrew the dagger from my heart.
It's not true!
There was no dagger.
He was killed by a sword.
Now it's getting interesting.
It seems you saw the whole thing.
So why didn't you tell the court?
I didn't want to get involved.
You can talk about it here, right?
Tell me, then.
Your story seems to be the most interesting.
I don't want to hear it.
No more horror stories.
They are common stories these days.
I even heard that the demon living here in Rashomon fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
Come on.
How much do you know?
I found the woman's hat in the mountains.
You already said that.
About 20 yards further,
I heard a woman crying.
From behind a bush,
I saw a man tied up, a woman crying and Tajomaru.
So you lied when you said you found the body.
I didn't want to get involved.
All right, then.
Go on.
What was Tajomaru doing?
He was down on his knees, begging the woman for forgiveness.
Until now, whenever I wanted to do something bad, I did it.
That way I suffered less.
But today, it's different.
I already had you, but I only want you more. It's very hard.
I beg you to be my wife.
The notorious bandit Tajomaru is begging you on his hands and knees.
If you wish, I'll even stop being a bandit.
I have enough stashed away to give you a lavish life.
And if you don't want my dirty money,
I'll even work.
I'll stoop to selling odds and ends on the street to support you.
I'll do anything if you come with me.
Marry me, please.
If you say no,
I have no choice but to kill you.
Please, say yes.
Stop crying and answer me.
Tell me you'll be my wife!
Say it!
It's impossible.
How could I, a woman, say anything?
I get it. You mean it's up to us men to decide.
Hold it!
I refuse to risk my life for such a woman.
You've been with two men.
Why don't you kill yourself?
Hopeless.
I don't want this shameless whore.
You can have her.
At this stage, I'd rather lose her instead of the horse.
- Wait!
- Don't follow me!
Stop crying.
It's not going to work anymore.
Stop it. Don't bully her.
Women are weak by nature.
It's you who are weak.
If you are my husband, why don't you kill this man?
Then you can tell me to kill myself.
That's a real man.
You're not a real man either.
When I heard you were Tajomaru,
I stopped crying.
I was sick of this tiresome daily farce.
I thought, "Tajomaru might get me out of this".
"If he'd only save me,
I'd do anything for him".
I thought to myself.
But you were just as petty as my husband.
Just remember: A woman loves a man who loves passionately.
A man has to make a woman his by his sword.
I don't want to die!
So that's the real story.
I don't tell lies.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I doubt it.
It's true. I don't lie.
No one lies after he says he's going to do so.
It's horrifying.
If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.
That's right. This world is hell.
No, I believe in men.
I don't want this place to be hell.
Shouting doesn't help.
Think about it. Out of these three, whose story is believable?
No idea.
In the end, you cannot understand the things men do.
What are you doing?
What's it to you?
- That's terrible!
- Terrible?
Someone else would have taken the kimono. Why shouldn't I?
- It's evil.
- Evil?
What about this kid's parents?
They had their fun and then they throw out the kid? They're evil.
No, you're wrong.
Look at the amulet on the kimono.
It was left to protect the baby.
Think about what they went through to abandon this baby.
I don't have time to mind everyone's feelings.
- You selfish...
- What's wrong with that?
Dogs are better off in this world.
If you're not selfish, you can't survive.
Damn it.
Everyone is selfish and dishonest.
Making excuses.
The bandit, the woman, the man and you!
And you aren't? That's funny.
You may have fooled the court, but not me.
So what did you do with the dagger?
The valuable one with the pearl inlay that Tajomaru was talking about?
What happened to it?
Did it disappear in the grass?
If you didn't, who stole it?
It seems I'm right.
A bandit calling another a bandit.
Now that's selfish.
Do you have anything else to say?
If not, I'll be going.
What are you doing?
Taking what little it has left?
I have six kids of my own.
Another one wouldn't make a difference.
I am ashamed of what I said.
It's inevitable to be suspicious of others on a day like this.
I'm the one who should be ashamed.
I don't understand my own soul.
No, I'm grateful to you.
Thanks to you,
I think I can keep my faith in man.
Don't mention it.
THE END
{5478}{5545}Freeze! Freeze!
{5704}{5788}- What did I do? I'm an honest citizen.|- Sure you are!
{5794}{5878}I'm trying to catch my tram.|My wife's waiting for me.
{5889}{5994}One, two, one, two, one...
{6164}{6285}Squad halt, right front, at ease.
{6319}{6397}"One month later"...
{6591}{6687}Hey, here I am!|Move it!
{6707}{6750}- You sure took your time.|- Hi.
{6762}{6862}- Norma my darling, are you fine?|- Just fine.
{6866}{6919}Counselor, are we all set?
{6923}{7009}Proietti, the best I can do is to|get you the minimum sentence.
{7013}{7098}Are you kidding?|I haven't confessed yet.
{7128}{7248}Counselor, I gotta get outta here,|now.
{7294}{7355}I've got a little job waiting|for me out of this joint
{7365}{7438}and if it turns out right,|I'll be set for life.
{7471}{7526}I met a guy in here
{7541}{7583}who told me something...
{7591}{7661}Hey, can't you yell quietly?
{7665}{7763}He's just told me my grandma has|been asleep for the last five days...
{7767}{7809}Well, keep it down|or you'll wake her up!
{7821}{7903}Counselor, let's find a legal|loophole 'cause I gotta get out.
{7907}{7944}Get the penal code out.
{7956}{8053}Listen here, article 403|is no good.
{8069}{8200}Go to 117, page 128.
{8218}{8310}You're an old offender...|if anything we might claim 521.
{8314}{8357}No, that's no good anymore.
{8370}{8471}We gotta claim 124 or 606.
{8487}{8539}How?|You were caught red-handed.
{8544}{8579}Did you already forget about 1400?
{8584}{8620}What's this 1400?
{8626}{8681}1400... the model you wanted|to steal...
{8688}{8758}Steal? Are you crazy?
{8766}{8805}I don't even have a driver's license.
{8817}{8863}What are you doing? I see,
{8878}{8969}you did all you could do.|I need a substitute.
{8985}{9010}I don't have any.
{9017}{9131}Not for you, for me.
{9156}{9209}I don't get mixed up|in this kind of business!
{9214}{9276}Who's asking you?|Go on, get lost.
{9280}{9341}Maybe I'll call you again when|I need to draw my will.
{9348}{9381}- Norma...|- Yes?
{9385}{9456}Listen here. Capannelle has|100,000 lira of mine.
{9464}{9499}Did you hear me?
{9503}{9588}That's to find someone|who'll take the rap for me.
{9607}{9661}A scapegoat, d'you hear me?
{9681}{9761}You know that when I come out,|if I pull that job,
{9765}{9826}I'll buy you a fur coat.
{9833}{9863}Marry me instead.
{9867}{9954}What? I'll get out of this short|sentence to get life?
{9958}{10004}Are you crazy?
{10167}{10213}- Call Othello.|- Why?
{10225}{10376}He's gotta take the rap|for someone else,
{10380}{10431}but just for a couple of months.
{10436}{10505}He's already in.|They pinched him yesterday.
{10689}{10760}Watch it, grandpa,|you blew my shot.
{10774}{10877}And you blew my eye out|of its socket! Damn it all...
{10892}{10973}Tell me kid, do you know|a guy called Mario,
{10977}{11022}who lives around here?
{11026}{11075}There are a thousand Marios|around here.
{11079}{11156}Yes, but this one is a thief.
{11161}{11196}There are still a thousand.
{11527}{11549}How much for this?
{11556}{11604}Stealing strollers now?
{11623}{11681}It's the only vehicle left|with wheels and no alarm.
{11710}{11764}We gotta paint it|or they'll recognize it.
{11782}{11811}Is 3,000 lira all right?
{11823}{11902}Hey, Mario. I've been looking for|you for the last two hours...
{11906}{11953}- May I?|- Be my guest.
{11983}{12038}- Eight thousand.|- No, take it away.
{12064}{12176}Listen up, I've got something|for you. Cosimo needs a scapegoat.
{12180}{12243}Just for a few months,|but very well paid.
{12247}{12317}If it's a matter of a few months,|why doesn't he serve them?
{12325}{12400}'Cause a very big job|came his way.
{12407}{12449}Are we set for 4,000, then?
{12473}{12551}4,000 and you throw in these|three umbrellas.
{12575}{12613}Hey, it's a baby carriage,|you know!
{12680}{12707}Fine, fine!
{12832}{12863}Are you winking at me?
{12867}{12939}Who's winkin'? I got hit in the eye.
{12943}{12981}Right, you got hit!
{13005}{13043}What are all the umbrellas for?
{13049}{13079}They're for my mother.
{13084}{13194}Holy cow! It always pours|in your mother's 'hood!
{13199}{13229}No, she misleads them|all the time.
{13233}{13279}Now she'll have some extras|and she'll stop bothering me.
{13283}{13350}So, what'd you say?|100,000 right away
{13354}{13405}and a little extra|once the job's done.
{13415}{13502}I'd go in myself, only I've taken|the rap three times already.
{13506}{13591}If I'll show up again it's life.
{13775}{13870}It's not like I don't want to,
{13887}{13948}but what do I tell my mother,|"See you, I'm off to prison"?
{13952}{14013}- Always your mother!|- Mind your business!
{14017}{14071}You're already on your way there!
{14081}{14128}Send the Sicilian guy,|Cosimo's pal!
{14132}{14188}- Who's this Sicilian?|- The small, skinny guy.
{14192}{14268}The one who keeps his sister|under lock as if she were a relic?
{14273}{14303}Ferribotte?
{14383}{14446}Michele. Michele,|someone's at the door.
{14601}{14680}Into the kitchen and|stay there 'til I tell you.
{14945}{14960}Who is it?
{14989}{15033}Friends... Mario and Capannelle.
{15255}{15274}Greetings.
{15278}{15313}Can't we come in for a moment?
{15317}{15391}Impossible. My sister's in.
{15436}{15487}I don't want her|to know about my business.
{15498}{15558}Besides, she's a minor|and she's engaged.
{15564}{15586}And when's the wedding?
{15616}{15658}The dowry question needs|to be settled.
{15662}{15715}She's gotta walk to the altar|with the greatest honor.
{15725}{15759}She mustn't be denied|a single thing.
{15766}{15824}See? Ferribotte is our man.
{15832}{15924}Well then, 100,000 lira would come|in handy for the dowry.
{15981}{16004}Not here.
{16090}{16126}Carmelina, I'm going downstairs.
{16228}{16257}Let's hear.
{16830}{16876}I can't leave Carmelina on her own.
{16880}{16949}And what if the groom found out?|Goodbye wedding.
{16967}{17000}He's from Abruzzi.
{17004}{17063}Those people from the North,|they're full of airs.
{17074}{17157}So difficult finding|a scapegoat these days!
{17256}{17297}Tiberio, the photographer...
{17312}{17345}He's in a very bad spot.
{17349}{17407}They've jailed his wife|for cigarette smuggling.
{17417}{17488}That's right.|Let's go see him. Move it.
{17506}{17626}Fine. I was looking for a scapegoat|and I only find shepherds.
{17670}{17745}Mario, take out the umbrellas.|Can't you see it's raining?
{17752}{17804}Are you crazy?|They're going to get wet.
{17808}{17883}What did you get them for, then?
{18073}{18150}Tiberio. Hey!
{18485}{18514}We've got urgent business|to discuss.
{18518}{18581}Shush! The kid's sleeping.
{18585}{18639}I though it was some serious deal.
{18647}{18716}Of course! Lucky you,|you don't have any! You'll see!
{18745}{18818}Can't you get laces for those shoes|instead of dragging them?
{18881}{18941}If he wakes up, I'll kill you!
{18952}{19002}It took me three hours|to put him to sleep.
{19007}{19038}Big deal!
{19058}{19261}Quiet... quiet I told you!|See, the slightest noise
{19265}{19316}irritates him, light irritates him...
{19320}{19376}he sleeps only in the darkroom...
{19425}{19463}- Did you hear about my wife?|- No...
{19502}{19619}80,000 fine, for cigarette smuggling,|commuted to three months.
{19631}{19731}Article 218. She's already|served one and a half months.
{19764}{19865}Such an unlucky year.|I even had to sell my camera.
{19916}{19985}No little jobs on the horizon,|some smuggling?
{19989}{20081}How about 100,000 lira|without lifting a finger?
{20085}{20110}- 100,000 lira?|- Yes.
{20119}{20148}I could kiss you!
{20174}{20216}You've woken up the kid.
{20261}{20351}There he goes again.|Have you lost it?
{20355}{20446}What are you doing? Watch it! You|can cry your eyes out, I've had it!
{20485}{20604}He's so spoiled! So cute though!|Have you ever seen him?
{20608}{20646}- No.|- Come see him.
{20690}{20759}Cutie... come here daddy's darling.
{20763}{20838}Hey, we ain't got no time to waste.
{20853}{20918}You're laughing now.|What am I going to do with you?
{20922}{20957}What am I going to do?
{20974}{21005}You tell him.
{21523}{21594}Ferribotte,|what's up with you, man?
{21605}{21721}Attempted theft of private|property, Article 712: Six months.
{21736}{21845}I am not a first time offender,|so I'll get 9 months for 100,000 fine.
{21853}{21949}That means 12,000 lira a month.|Big deal!
{21954}{21978}How much do you want?
{21986}{22083}No, we're far off... Stop it!
{22097}{22142}Get your hands off the baby food!
{22148}{22194}I understand you've lost|your teeth, still...
{22247}{22339}And right now I really can't.|Where would I leave the kid?
{22343}{22427}- In jail, with your wife.|- Sure!
{22431}{22515}They're well looked after in there.|They've got the best nursery ever.
{22527}{22651}The best in all Rome. I still|remember it. When I was three...
{22659}{22747}No, no, the kid'll go to jail|when he's all grown up.
{22755}{22784}- And if he chooses.|- Fine.
{22794}{22879}Guys, you'll never get an ex-con|for 100,000 lira.
{22892}{22929}You need someone with|a clean record.
{22938}{23003}Someone with a clean record?|Who knows someone like that?
{23105}{23129}Actually, I do know someone...
{23133}{23167}Who?
{23193}{23313}I understand it's almost April,|but why should I play the fool?
{23330}{23384}You're always broke.
{23393}{23450}And you still owe me for those|passport pictures.
{23457}{23525}Hey, do you or do you not|read the papers.
{23536}{23642}I'm favored, and if I win|I might even be a contender.
{23658}{23701}Sure, contend what?
{23717}{23758}With that spare tire around|your waist.
{23855}{23929}Are you Cosimo's moll?
{23942}{23966}Yea, why?
{23995}{24061}Well then, it must have|been a while since...
{24091}{24125}Get lost.
{24232}{24261}Over here.
{24360}{24430}If we each put in a little something,|we might make it.
{24457}{24481}- How much?|- There are five of us. 10,000 lira a head.
{24485}{24551}Marchetti and Picchioni.|Come on, it's your turn.
{24555}{24594}Coming.
{24816}{24839}What do you want?
{24845}{24898}Will 150,000 do?
{24912}{24947}We'll rustle up 50,000.
{24952}{24990}I can't.
{25029}{25130}I'd be barred from the ring,|understand?
{25140}{25215}Take it easy. You have no record.
{25222}{25283}You could get out on probation.|At most, you'll get six months.
{25290}{25337}Listen, read the papers|tomorrow morning.
{25352}{25417}You'll find me in the sports pages,
{25421}{25491}and my opponent in the obituaries.
{25534}{25632}Hey, doll, come on inside. I'll show|you who's got the spare tire.
{25823}{25914}Bravo. That was a really|great idea!
{25924}{25999}Do you think a beefcake like him,|would ever play the scapegoat?
{26415}{26464}Bring in the self-confessed criminal.
{26620}{26765}Your Honor, when I read that a|poor old man was languishing in jail,
{26769}{26864}my conscience got the best of me.|I'm here to confess my crime.
{26868}{26931}It was me, it was me the scoundrel,
{26935}{27030}that forced the car door|and ran away.
{27034}{27088}Your Honor, this man is innocent.
{27095}{27117}- Oh, it's you!|- I'm the one.
{27121}{27232}You scum. I had to go through|the humiliation of been jailed,
{27236}{27280}because of you.
{27284}{27366}- I got thirteen months.|- Courage.
{27370}{27444}Thirteen months I got.|Me, an honest man.
{27448}{27510}A poor family man...|a sick, old man...
{27514}{27572}And all because of you! Jude!
{27662}{27753}I might deserve your contempt but|I'm imploring you to forgive me.
{27757}{27839}I even went to the Chapel|of Divine Love.
{27843}{27917}Please, help me clean this slate|and start anew, please.
{27921}{28012}All right, all right. If you've made|amends, I'll forgive you.
{28016}{28056}No hard feelings.
{28060}{28098}Thank you, thanks.
{28102}{28123}Are you done?
{28127}{28159}Yes, your Honor, yes.
{28165}{28196}Fine. Lock them up... both of them.
{28207}{28302}One, two, one, two, one...
{28463}{28564}Squad halt, right front, at ease.
{28671}{28726}Wait, wait.
{28812}{28878}Damn. It was you, you!
{28983}{29093}No, here we're all honest.|Put out your hand. Wait, wait.
{29211}{29238}What are you waiting for?
{29355}{29466}Cutie pie, if you don't give|back the dough,
{29470}{29534}you'll sleep with the fishes.|Got it?
{29604}{29644}I don't think so.
{29657}{29711}Listen, you coward...
{29727}{29841}Hey Cosimo, why did I get|the dough? To get locked up.
{29859}{29883}I am locked up.
{29891}{29986}And why did I give you the money?|To get out. Am I out?
{30005}{30084}- Well, what do you want?|- Scram.
{30095}{30153}You could have kept it up|a little better.
{30157}{30213}It's obvious you've never seen any|innocent people. I'm telling you.
{30220}{30306}Is it my fault?|You were pathetic.
{30310}{30379}Such a shame! What would|you do outside anyway?
{30402}{30437}At least here,|they'll feed you for free.
{30459}{30532}Fine. You filthy beast.
{30544}{30627}I had a little job to take care of|if I got out.
{30631}{30689}No risks involved|and major payoff.
{30701}{30764}And instead, because of you,|everything has gone up in smoke!
{30842}{30869}What little job?
{30883}{31037}This Cosimo will tell you for sure!|So you can go and steal my plan?
{31041}{31185}And when you get out...|Oh, pretty boy, scram, scram!
{31199}{31277}I can't even think about it.|You know how the adage goes.
{31281}{31331}Think about it twice|and you're a cuckold.
{31335}{31384}Cuckold?! You're talking to me,|you dirty...
{31388}{31442}Let go or I'll kill you.
{31446}{31528}How dare you?|You're talking to me?
{31532}{31605}Chow, boys. Chow.
{31609}{31675}Pasta and beans.
{32419}{32530}This is the 1:45 to Ancona.
{32630}{32668}Who gives a damn?
{32795}{32861}May your father and mother|drop dead if you have a cigarette
{32865}{32928}and aren't sharing.
{33049}{33085}All orphans here, I see...
{33145}{33227}Pass the bottle|I want to have a puff.
{33336}{33366}Move.
{33465}{33500}Look, they've got their sentence.
{33580}{33642}Jailed for stealing hay.
{33689}{33721}They seem pretty beat.
{33946}{34005}The poor things must have|gotten a good licking!
{34413}{34480}- Go ask...|"- You", go.
{34502}{34550}Boy, are you tired!
{34555}{34610}I bet you can't wait to die,|so you can rest forever.
{34854}{34962}How many? A few months?
{34978}{35005}Years.
{35037}{35067}Three years...
{35460}{35527}I guess you're happy now,|aren't you?
{35534}{35580}- How can it be?|- Right!
{35584}{35634}- I'd like our lawyer's opinion.|- Sure.
{35638}{35726}Counselor... oh, come here...|What's up?
{35730}{35807}Lawyer? This is your lawyer?
{35826}{35912}Get away, damn it, all is lost now.
{35973}{36103}Three years. Three years...|Oh, my poor mother. Damn it all.
{36109}{36139}It's not my fault!
{36147}{36256}And 150,000 lira.|My poor, poor mother!
{36278}{36303}Well, no.
{36307}{36356}You've buried me alive,|that's what you've done!
{36377}{36491}Come on, be a man!|Where's all your courage?
{36495}{36538}Sure...
{36551}{36618}What about me?|You call "me" lucky?
{36622}{36656}Don't you touch me.
{36691}{36792}- Peppe, come on, don't give in.|- Sure.
{36799}{36839}I'll take care of your mother...
{36861}{36943}if, when I get out I pull off|that job, you'll see...
{36965}{37042}If I were out right now,|damn it all!
{37060}{37200}Still thinking about that deal.|Some stupid lousy idea, I bet you...
{37207}{37248}Stupid, eh?
{37279}{37367}Last month I met a bricklayer in|here. He was being transferred.
{37371}{37431}He'd stabbed his brother-in-law.
{37449}{37558}He told me he'd just finished|building a very thin partition wall...
{37568}{37627}one of those you could poke|open with your finger...
{37636}{37654}So?
{37672}{37782}Between a... a dining room|and pawnshop.
{37793}{37918}And what do you think there was|in this room? The crib!
{37961}{37981}What?
{38002}{38131}The crib. The safe for the jewels!|The crib!
{38135}{38190}Now you tell me whose rotten luck|is it? Yours or mine?
{38205}{38266}Right... this makes me sleep easier!
{38301}{38373}And... and how were you gonna|get into the apartment?
{38393}{38479}Knocking? "May I come in?|I have a hole to drill..."
{38486}{38551}What do you mean,|how would I get in?
{38555}{38591}Through the coal bin, of course.
{38606}{38733}The apartment is vacant.|An unsplit inheritance,
{38737}{38819}the usual formalities,|legalities, courts proceedings.
{38831}{38951}Vacant, understand?|While here I am, locked up.
{39002}{39027}Where is it?
{39054}{39097}Via delle Madonne.
{39212}{39247}You know what I say?
{39251}{39276}What?
{39327}{39366}Sounds like a good sting.
{39408}{39441}I like it.
{39456}{39487}Where are you going?
{39509}{39678}I got a year... on probation.|All my best. See you!
{39682}{39762}Drop dead, you cowardly scumbag!
{39766}{39901}"The news traveled fast".
{39976}{40005}Capannelle!
{40059}{40117}What's going on?
{40121}{40167}- He's getting out.|- What?
{40171}{40215}- He's getting out.|- Who? Cosimo?
{40219}{40318}No, Peppe. He's got to give us|back the money now.
{40329}{40405}For sure, or we'll beat him up.
{40409}{40505}You tell Tiberio.|I'll tell Ferribotte. See ya!
{40513}{40550}Leave it to me!
{41095}{41116}Who's there?
{41276}{41357}Michele. I forgot my keys.
{41648}{41677}But you're pretty.
{41746}{41816}I heard you never get out|'cause you're ugly.
{41826}{41919}I don't know you. Leave. Michele|is due back any minute now.
{42026}{42095}I hope so. I have something very|important to tell him.
{42112}{42195}But first I'll tell him I'm going|to turn him in for kidnapping...
{42204}{42282}I understand keeping a girl|under lock and key in Sicily.
{42292}{42329}There's nowhere to go there!
{42338}{42388}Nothing but rocks|and cacti down there...
{42436}{42508}Cactus is probably what grows|in "your" backyard!
{42516}{42621}I wish. Only mushrooms there!|I live in a basement.
{42628}{42690}It serves you right,|talking that way about Sicily!
{42697}{42804}Just joking. My name is Mario.|Mario Angeletti. And yours?
{42824}{42842}Carmela.
{42860}{42981}You don't say! All Sicilian women|are called Carmela. But tell me...
{42999}{43072}do you really like being always|locked up in the house?
{43121}{43221}Sometimes I get out.|I go to the graveyard.
{43241}{43288}That's fun for sure.
{43339}{43378}I visit my mother.
{43489}{43537}I'm a real ass, sorry!
{43602}{43716}It's all right. And your mother,|is she still with you?
{43727}{43752}What?
{43758}{43783}Is she alive?
{43792}{43835}Oh, yes, yes, for sure she is.
{43843}{43876}Michele! Hurry!
{44273}{44337}Carmela, get decent.|Your fiancé is here.
{44540}{44575}I am presentable.
{44627}{44655}Come in.
{44672}{44748}May I? Good morning.
{44758}{44802}See if there is any coffee.
{45128}{45211}This question of the mattresses|doesn't add up.
{45218}{45275}My mother says it's up to the bride.
{45288}{45324}What about the reception?!
{45332}{45380}Reception and banquet, we split.
{45397}{45448}There's another question|my mother wants cleared.
{45463}{45530}She doesn't understand|what business you're in.
{45550}{45643}What's that got to do with it?|I'm... I'm a citrus fruit salesman.
{45647}{45684}Citrus?|Would that be the company?
{45688}{45723}I'm sorry.
{45792}{45812}What's that?
{45853}{45911}You wait here, I get this.
{46205}{46235}- Desiderio...|- What?
{46260}{46300}- Come with me.|- Fine.
{46616}{46652}- Wait here.|- All right.
{46717}{46757}They are releasing Peppe|the boxer.
{46761}{46800}We've gotta get our money back.
{46808}{46859}God, I run like crazy...|I'm all out of breath.
{47494}{47608}How are you doing, troublemaker?
{47640}{47662}Fine.
{47726}{47751}Out with the money.
{47823}{47876}Why? What money.
{47963}{48013}Can't you remember why I got it?
{48088}{48133}To go in, instead of Cosimo, right?
{48261}{48318}Right, and now you make sure|you book a bed in the ER,
{48322}{48355}'cause we're sending you|straight there.
{48359}{48412}You're tough. Four against one?
{48416}{48463}Yeah, but we'll beat you up|just once!
{48467}{48542}Why?|You should be happy to see me.
{48561}{48642}Wait a minute, wait. Easy.
{48655}{48705}What's the matter?|Don't you trust me?
{48740}{48784}What is it you want?
{48854}{48887}I'm... I'm... in charge of the deal...
{48920}{48959}Cosimo told me.
{48973}{49032}What are you doing with that|bottle? Put it down!
{49036}{49082}What do you mean,|Cosimo told you?
{49092}{49172}Sure he did. The sting,|we'll tackle it together.
{49190}{49269}I... I was coming to see you.|No need for... watch it...
{49286}{49351}You're a sly one, aren't you?
{49355}{49442}Fine, fine. Forget it and let's get|down to... Cut it out.
{49446}{49496}That's the baby's biscuits.
{49541}{49631}You're all so suspicious|I shouldn't tell you a thing.
{49679}{49759}Fine. Prick up your ears.|To pull this one off
{49763}{49806}we've gotta prepare|everything beforehand,
{49810}{49859}calculate everything scientifically.
{49883}{49914}Do you remember|Via delle Madonne?
{49920}{49939}Yeah.
{49948}{50011}Well, there's a pawnshop there.|Know it?
{50021}{50082}Sure I do!|They even got my sheets there.
{50094}{50161}We're not talking about sheets now.|We're talking jewelry.
{50187}{50237}You're not thinking of breaking in,|then and there,
{50241}{50283}in the middle of the street?
{50287}{50377}Of course not! We'll get there|through a vacant apartment.
{50422}{50533}There - those are the windows.|Right?
{50590}{50631}And that's the door.
{50647}{50669}Picklock?
{50673}{50762}No. No lock picking,|we'd be exposed for too long.
{50768}{50809}There's a safer way.|Follow me.
{51030}{51091}Over there, on the right,|see the coal bin?
{51139}{51163}We'll go in through there.
{51182}{51211}And where do we come out?
{51217}{51320}I'll explain later. Capannelle,|pretend to tie your shoelaces
{51324}{51368}and check out that padlock.
{51373}{51414}My shoes don't have laces.
{51447}{51495}Fine. Ferribotte, please.
{51929}{51978}8 mm pliers will do.
{52021}{52083}There. From the coal bin|we come out there...
{52136}{52170}go down...
{52229}{52305}take that stairway, see?
{52393}{52430}Then up through the roof.
{52480}{52533}Another little iron ladder this time.
{52571}{52619}And from there,|we come up to the terrace.
{52626}{52650}Just like an elevator.
{52656}{52677}- What then?|- Wait:
{52684}{52725}Move over so|you can see well.
{52748}{52815}There, did you get to the terrace?
{52821}{52846}I hope so.
{52895}{52947}Now we go across the skylight-
{53008}{53100}quietly, everybody's asleep,|nobody hears us-
{53115}{53224}and we get to that window,|the one with the bars.
{53293}{53317}What do you see there?
{53357}{53480}The crib... The crib!
{53486}{53574}Sure, but you must be crazy.|Sawing the bars?
{53626}{53751}Who said anything about sawing?|Look at that window... on the left...
{53808}{53822}Well?
{53849}{53925}Well, I told you it's a walk|in the park.
{53949}{54127}So? That's the vacant apartment's|window. Look, there it is.
{54173}{54270}We go in... there's a partition wall|that's a pushover...
{54285}{54344}and there we are: Crib's room.
{54348}{54406}Nice and easy with all|those millions waiting for us.
{54413}{54446}- What? Millions?|- Millions!
{54450}{54490}Quiet!
{54498}{54615}Capannelle though,|he can't come with us.
{54632}{54720}- Why not?|- Look at you, dressed that way!
{54765}{54787}Sportswear.
{54791}{54851}Sportswear, my ass!|You're in thief's uniform!
{54855}{54941}- You'll have us arrested that way!|- We'll end up in jail for sure.
{54945}{54996}How do we open the safe?|With the magic combination?
{55000}{55036}What kind of photographer|are you?
{55048}{55078}What's that got to do with anything?
{55082}{55151}It follows. To everybody, the job|he's best suited for.
{55166}{55224}That's how the 'scientific'|method works.
{55243}{55321}You set up here,
{55333}{55390}with your camera and that thing|that gets things close...
{55394}{55421}The telephoto lens.
{55425}{55496}Yes, that one. Wait for|the employee to open the safe
{55510}{55561}and snap his every move.
{55575}{55638}Then we call a safe expert.
{55646}{55692}Dante Cruciani is the best.
{55701}{55794}Dante Cruciani, for instance. We'll|show him the film, and that's it.
{55799}{55831}Great idea!
{55845}{55905}By the way, my camera is gone.
{55911}{55977}So what? At Porta Portese they|have all the cameras you need.
{55982}{56015}But I'm flat broke!
{56019}{56056}Were you thinking of buying it?
{56074}{56129}Just work with me. We'll handle it.
{56328}{56433}You're bound to make a good|impression on your cousin
{56437}{56506}with this painting. Don't you think?
{56513}{56589}Well, I really couldn't say...
{56593}{56711}See, see here, it has depth to it.|See this tree here.
{56715}{56811}It's a very tasteful gift.|Genteel, almost.
{56851}{56911}This cypress shooting up|into the sky,
{56937}{57036}the pleasantness of the countryside,|the ducks, the pretty dame?
{57048}{57100}And, look, signed by Raphael.
{57111}{57201}Yes, but Raphael de Santis...
{57211}{57285}For a thousand lira, what do you|want? A real Raphael?
{57307}{57351}Well. I wouldn't know,
{57355}{57421}but a gift should always be|the best one can pick.
{57427}{57492}Come now.|For a thousand lira, it's a... steal.
{57515}{57541}That's true.
{58034}{58107}Cute, these aprons.|Let me have three.
{58111}{58151}I think for my mother|they're just fine.
{58155}{58204}- All three of them?|- Yes, those. All three alike.
{58208}{58241}The ones with Donald Duck.
{58247}{58267}I got it.
{58601}{58651}Shut up and pay attention.|There's the safe.
{58666}{58694}The crib!
{58704}{58761}Quiet, I have to focus it.|I was trying to focus it.
{58773}{58837}It's moving.|I was setting up the shot...
{58913}{58945}It's all blurred.
{58962}{59016}Well kids, the camera is old,|the lens is old,
{59020}{59058}this ain't Hollywood, you know.
{59103}{59149}- And who's the kid?|- Who is it?
{59153}{59217}- It's my kid, I shot a few trial|frames at home. - He's cute!
{59221}{59260}- Really cute!|- Cutie!
{59264}{59309}But he's crying.|Why is he crying so much?
{59313}{59398}Daddy's boy!|Look what a close up he got.
{59402}{59512}Look closely, now he gets up...|goes to the safe... look closely...
{59516}{59586}Watch what he's doing now...|and see what a shot I got!
{59769}{59814}We've even got the pants|in the shot.
{59818}{59858}Filming the underpants adds to the|shot... What did you do? Go on, go!
{59862}{59898}You're wasting our time.
{59939}{60048}It can happen. Now it's coming up|again. Shut up. Here it is.
{60052}{60069}And what's that supposed to be?
{60073}{60086}- What did you do?|- I shot it in over two days.
{60134}{60161}- Cute, though.|- The kid, does he cry all the time?
{60165}{60179}I don't believe this.
{60183}{60224}I had enough.|Who cares about the kid, really!
{60228}{60288}- And who's this guy?|- The bartender.
{60295}{60347}Who gives a damn about|the bartender?
{60357}{60409}I wasn't the one to send for coffee,|you know!
{60435}{60523}There's a lady coming in now|with a watch. She puts it down,
{60530}{60618}he picks it up, takes it to the safe.|Here she comes, see?
{60663}{60730}- Hey, look, it's your watch Capanne', look.|- What?
{60737}{60885}Quiet, now he gives her the receipt.|There. See, now?
{60905}{60955}Watch carefully now, this is it.|Here it comes.
{60959}{60999}It's skipping.
{61003}{61084}It skips because it's old;|we got it at Porta Portese.
{61214}{61296}The combination, watch it, watch...
{61430}{61567}- All the money we've invested!|- Money? I stole it!
{61591}{61722}Be quiet...|So Dante, what do you think?
{61984}{62049}- As a movie? It's lousy.|- Thanks a lot!
{62053}{62115}- Did you hear that?|- Sure I did.
{62145}{62211}But what I got to see,|it's better than nothing at all.
{62226}{62327}So... The safe:|It's a Commodoro 50 model,
{62346}{62390}and not a particularly|difficult one.
{62409}{62438}It's in the bag then!
{62442}{62502}Who's that? Ferribotte?
{62528}{62624}Ah, the job at Foro Pancrazio,|via Merulana, 1952?
{62630}{62678}No, I didn't get the honor.
{62687}{62799}'Til last year I was in plumbing|with Armando Lucherini.
{62813}{62920}Ah, little Armando, he knows|the tools of his trade, all right.
{62927}{62951}And so?
{62963}{63143}Well, boys, it's 50,000|for my services.
{63151}{63190}- Are we understood?|- Oh, God.
{63194}{63232}- What did he just say?|- Exorbitant.
{63236}{63274}- And in advance!|- Fifty thousand!
{63302}{63534}{y:i}So it was up to Mario to come up|"with the money".
{64547}{64585}Mario, it's you!
{64601}{64627}Ada!
{64640}{64666}How are things?
{64672}{64700}Not too bad.
{64712}{64784}Ada, come see who's here.
{64812}{64851}Mario's here!
{64862}{64908}Hi, my beautiful big mamma.|How are you?
{64912}{64936}Fine, and you?
{64946}{64968}Fine, fine.
{64983}{65067}Let me look at you.|How ugly you've become...
{65071}{65096}What do you mean 'ugly'?
{65100}{65139}Assunta. Assunta.
{65148}{65182}I bet you Mario's here.
{65242}{65318}I knew it. There he is. Mario!
{65322}{65415}Ciao, my beautiful big mamma.
{65469}{65504}You're looking good.
{65522}{65599}Let's take another look.|You look so run down.
{65603}{65669}- No.|- Sure you are. You're so run down.
{65673}{65746}What do you mean 'run down'?|He doesn't look it to me.
{65750}{65800}- The last one to see you, right?|- Hi, mom.
{65822}{65871}- I need to have a word with you.|- How are you?
{65903}{65952}- Are you back?|- Quiet, don't shout.
{65956}{66071}- Take off your coats.|- Wash your hands.
{66101}{66155}What did he tell her?|That he wants to have a word?
{66164}{66221}Why her?|Don't we count for anything?
{66360}{66408}- Did something happen?|- No.
{66456}{66536}He says he's here|for his bank book.
{66545}{66656}I need some money to buy a coat.|I'm cold.
{66684}{66716}We'll take care of it.
{66729}{66798}The countess will give us one|of her capes.
{66805}{66837}She's got a storage room full.
{66846}{66948}Can you picture me in one of those|capes? I've had enough of them.
{66954}{67058}He's right. Mario is a man now,|and he needs a real coat.
{67164}{67214}When are they going|to get new ones?
{67225}{67298}This here is the hole I made|to hide my cigarettes in!
{67312}{67429}Now, tell me, Mario...|You're not unemployed, are you?
{67449}{67556}No, I work... now and then,|but I work.
{67565}{67649}Why is it you can't get|a steady job?
{67657}{67702}You're a certified cabinetmaker.
{67711}{67766}Right, certified.
{67779}{67868}I know what it is. He's ashamed to|show the diploma he got from here.
{67886}{68034}Why does it have to say|'orphanage'... charitable institution?
{68044}{68089}What kind of a diploma is that?|It's like being branded a son of a...
{68178}{68282}Mario, listen. We'll lend you|the money for the coat,
{68286}{68333}but you're keeping your hands off|your savings.
{68358}{68451}No, in that case I'll do without it.
{68599}{68704}Of all the brats that pass|through here,
{68708}{68781}why am I the only one|you put up with?
{68868}{68948}Don't worry,|I'll put the money back.
{68974}{69042}I have some friends,|and if all goes well
{69046}{69091}I'll take all three of you|away from here.
{69392}{69464}Every safe is a thing unto itself.
{69514}{69569}Some have crossed bars,
{69611}{69677}some are triangular,|and others circular.
{69710}{69780}All of them, however,|are made so that the lock
{69784}{69810}doesn't have|any openings around it.
{69824}{69879}Hey, what are you doing? Eating?
{69913}{70007}Just pay a little attention, right?|You can eat during recess.
{70084}{70184}Now, one way to opening them|is by using dynamite.
{70200}{70285}The system preferred by the|famous "fù" Cimin.
{70308}{70364}Fu-Ci-Min?|Who is he? A Chinese guy?
{70375}{70419}What Chinese? He was Venetian.
{70428}{70520}Fó means... 'the late',|Cimin is his surname, see?
{70550}{70618}The poor guy got blown up|with the safe.
{70657}{70783}Therefore, I'm ruling out|this method outright, O.K.?
{70803}{70977}- So let's carry on. As I was saying...|- Dante Cruciani? Checking on you.
{71001}{71045}Oh poor me, the cops, the cops...
{71104}{71139}Here I am, sergeant.
{71212}{71294}Rascals! Scoundrels!
{71322}{71385}If I catch one of them|I'll beat him black and blue!
{71424}{71528}Rascals!|They almost gave me a heart attack.
{71554}{71605}I thought it was unlikely.|He did stop by yesterday.
{71622}{71778}Right, listen here... Most safes|have three or four locks.
{71789}{71832}Only one matters, though.
{71841}{71877}And now do we know|which one it is?
{71885}{71971}How do you know, eh? Drill|a little hole and insert a pipe!
{72003}{72033}I see...
{72041}{72081}You fill the safe with water...
{72091}{72106}Water?
{72111}{72160}...from the lock that... water, water...
{72188}{72301}from the lock that spills|the watery... liquid... let's say...
{72305}{72342}that's the good one.
{72346}{72375}But, is it practical?
{72379}{72402}No.
{72419}{72473}Guys, let's clarify one thing|right now.
{72484}{72576}No method is 100 percent sure|when dealing with safes.
{72594}{72739}There's one and only one guarantee:|The circular saw.
{72772}{72861}And now let's move on to some|practical exercise
{72865}{72943}with a dummy safe...
{73001}{73193}Here we are. See all these holes?|These are all timings studied by me.
{73221}{73399}Watch it now.|Fu Cimin system... dynamite...
{73502}{73617}Notice the perfection, and|the diameter of this orifice here,
{73621}{73649}one hour and fifteen minutes!
{73653}{73679}One hour and fifteen minutes!
{73683}{73717}Right! Right...
{73725}{73900}In those times! Industrially|powered saw, fifty kilos of metal.
{73904}{73932}Right, goodbye!
{73936}{73975}No, no... no, absolutely out|of the question.
{73979}{74181}Well, look at this other hole,|Wolgemut, German, handsaw.
{74214}{74340}With a lot of elbow grease|you might swing it in three hours.
{74364}{74408}Have you got three hours?
{74436}{74535}Tonight we're sorting out|the watches
{74539}{74598}to study the movements|in the building,
{74622}{74700}the store's hours,|very scientific you know.
{74717}{74782}Still, we should have|three hours clean.
{74796}{74957}Now let's go ahead with the job...|"in corpore vili"... You.
{74974}{74989}What?
{74993}{75067}Take the oil can and lubricate.
{75076}{75223}Lubrication must be continuous|and uninterrupted.
{75229}{75289}I'd rather not get mixed up|with these technicalities...
{75293}{75313}Go ahead!
{75317}{75417}Dante Cruciani. Checking on you.
{75459}{75548}Rascals. If I catch one of them|I'll make him black and blue.
{75554}{75650}Ready? Go ahead. All ready?
{75658}{75706}It's 5:35 pm.
{75710}{75733}You tell us tomorrow.
{75737}{75774}I'm going, O.K.?
{75854}{75906}Dad, dad the sergeant is here.
{75918}{76013}Oh, God, God I'm done for.|Hide the safe.
{76018}{76133}Cruciani! Where are you?
{76161}{76227}Cruciani! Are you there?
{76354}{76474}Boys! What's up?
{76492}{76546}"It's the pretty ladies' soap"...
{76576}{76668}- Hello, sarge.|- Sarge, how are you?
{76687}{76809}Hello, sarge, just doing|a little laundry, see?
{77295}{77329}Excuse me, have you got a match?
{77370}{77439}You could have showed up|a little earlier.
{77443}{77508}You know I've got the kid,|damn it!
{77555}{77661}The doorman opens up at six,|then he cleans the stairway,
{77750}{77804}starting from the top floor.
{77808}{77859}The pawnshop opens at eight...|Thanks.
{77999}{78101}Listen here. The tobacconist opens|at 8 am too.
{78105}{78162}Gimme back my matches.
{78212}{78277}Take this... cutie!
{78329}{78385}Nicoletta! Nicoletta!
{78393}{78447}Buy two bars of butter!
{78453}{78537}If you don't have enough money|tell them to put it on the account.
{78541}{78571}But hurry!
{78613}{78653}Isn't that our apartment?
{78657}{78691}Yes, and there are people in it.
{78750}{78777}It's over.
{78796}{78949}"It was a tough set back", "but"|"our heroes didn't give up".
{78978}{79061}The owners are two old spinsters.|They never leave the house.
{79065}{79108}That's really good news.
{79114}{79182}You shut your mouth!|Kept watch all day
{79186}{79225}and didn't notice a thing!
{79244}{79345}But every Thursday they go to|oversee their vineyards in Genzano.
{79352}{79388}Leaving the house unattended?
{79394}{79441}No, the little maid stays back.
{79447}{79471}And she's hot.
{79525}{79598}I got it, I got it.|Whenever there's a pretty girl,
{79622}{79697}sooner or later, Peppe|finds his way in.
{80136}{80250}Such apples, such apples!|Sweet like molasses!
{80254}{80399}Ehi, do you remember this song?|Miss? Miss, may I carry your bags?
{80403}{80433}Ehi, she's dumb.
{80440}{80512}No, she's not, right?|You can't just leave. Listen.
{80516}{80537}You're gorgeous!
{80551}{80591}If you don't leave now,|I'll smash your head with my bag!
{80595}{80649}She is sour and... sweet.
{80672}{80707}Leave me alone|or I'll call the police.
{80711}{80763}Good, so we get locked up|together.
{80798}{80863}Well? What's this?
{80905}{80973}Where do you live?|This is a civilized country!
{81037}{81070}This is none of your business.
{81078}{81117}Shame on you!
{81124}{81151}See you!
{81309}{81345}Mother of God!
{81351}{81401}You bully! Let me go,|you're breaking my arm.
{81405}{81461}This hurts!|Good God, I'm sorry!
{81465}{81511}What are you doing? He wasn't|doing anything! Let them go!
{81515}{81593}Just go, quickly!
{81617}{81647}Let's go, let's go, he's strong!
{81744}{81796}- D'you hurt 'em, poor things?|- They deserved it.
{81829}{81906}May I?|Pierluigi Capannelle, accountant.
{81921}{81958}Are you from up North too?
{81962}{82033}Padua... well, I really must go now.
{82037}{82054}Why?
{82058}{82142}My fiancé is waiting. He's off duty.
{82148}{82227}He's a captain, but next month he'll|be promoted lieutenant. Goodbye.
{82531}{82634}Miss, miss!
{82705}{82746}Could I see you again?
{82758}{82848}What? Not today. I'm expecting|my fiancé from Brescia...
{82864}{82915}I say! How many|fiancés have you got?
{82921}{82942}Three.
{82980}{83123}And with all... all your workload...|you find time for all three of them?
{83138}{83162}What workload?
{83202}{83290}Well... your shopping.|Don't you go shopping?
{83297}{83403}I do it because it's fun,|I lend my aunts a hand,
{83407}{83434}as I'm staying with them.
{83452}{83495}You see, my father's a colonel.
{83516}{83586}Ah, I see, all in the army then?
{83599}{83753}No, my father is... what d'you|call it? In the alpine corps.
{83765}{83856}The alpine corps. Good, good.|In the North we're,
{83860}{83934}we're all in the alpine corps, right?
{83985}{84012}Hello.
{84080}{84164}It's only that, when|you're a salesman
{84168}{84268}traveling all the time,|your accent gets contaminated.
{84278}{84312}But traveling is so nice, right?
{84320}{84461}Right, but putting down roots too.|Me, I am a gypsy.
{84537}{84693}It's ugly Miss, you know,|to be Ionely, defenseless...
{84726}{84792}Defenseless yes,|but you're nice and strong right?
{84800}{84866}Well, yes... I do train.
{84891}{84953}You're not a boxer, right?|So gruesome...
{84957}{85111}No, no, no! What boxing!|Tennis, golf, polo...
{85132}{85218}I say, you know how to punch|even without having learned to box.
{85224}{85294}That's not it; those two|were two dirty low lives.
{85332}{85444}No... no... it's not like I despise|the lower classes.
{85456}{85558}I like them a lot. Actually,|the lower the better.
{85614}{85684}...I like... I like maids too...
{85697}{85723}Good!
{85727}{85869}Let's say you were a maid.|I would like you all the same.
{85878}{85929}That is so generous of you.
{85937}{85988}Nicoletta! Nicoletta!|What are you doing?
{85992}{86023}Coming.
{86059}{86088}Who's that?
{86106}{86240}He's... he's my boyfriend's|attendant... Goodbye.
{86254}{86293}Could... could we meet tomorrow?
{86300}{86412}No, not tomorrow. Sunday, four|o'clock, here. Right? Goodbye.
{86535}{86605}So, what's up with that one?
{86612}{86645}Nothing. He's my cousin.
{86649}{86672}Right. Your cousin!
{86676}{86707}Let's go so you can give me a hand|with the shopping.
{86711}{86738}Let's go, let's go.
{86765}{86827}{y:i}But Peppe and his friends didn't|{y:i}take into account that now
{86831}{86983}{y:i}and then in Italy|"there's a general pardon"...
{87618}{87641}Steer.
{87831}{87965}Kid, come here... let me in...|follow that car...
{88075}{88110}Enough!
{88141}{88237}Go, that one, go, c'mon.|There it is... bump it!
{88393}{88474}Hurry! There he is, run him down!
{88629}{88672}Get off, you rotter! Get off!
{88676}{88775}If you wanna speak with me,|get an appointment.
{88779}{88809}Appointment?
{88820}{88878}Get your hands off me! Get lost!|Take your hands off me. Go away!
{88882}{88919}I'll give you the appointment!|Coward, come out!
{88979}{89024}Move Nicoletta! Leave me alone!|...and stop it!
{89044}{89078}Where are you running off to?|I'll kill you!
{89082}{89105}Nicoletta! Here, grab!
{89140}{89186}What are you doing? It's loaded!
{89240}{89278}Stop! You coward!
{89312}{89365}Mind! There are live caps in it.
{89374}{89405}Don't move! I'll kill you, you know!
{89482}{89546}Are you crazy? You're blinding me!
{89570}{89613}Cosimo, stop! What are you doing?
{89617}{89678}You get out of the way.|You went off with him!
{89682}{89738}Do you want|to compromise yourself?
{89743}{89763}Stop it! Let me go!
{89767}{89809}- Cosimo, don't play the fool.|- A fool?
{89819}{89864}St... st... stay with us.|Let's work together.
{89868}{89887}With you?
{89891}{89917}We are all friends, right?
{89921}{89950}Shut your mouth, slut!
{89954}{90022}- Get lost! You old man!|- Old man?
{90026}{90056}- You're old and you're acting all|cocky! - Me? You're calling me old?
{90102}{90156}Careful, or I'm going to kill you,|you know!
{90672}{90787}Cosimo, I don't bear any grudges,
{90836}{90876}if you wanna stay with us
{90911}{90939}and get your share.
{91201}{91317}Cosimo, he never just got his slice.
{91336}{91384}Well, then, I'm sorry,
{91420}{91494}but here we follow Menga's laws.
{91603}{91665}You're a dirty bunch.
{92385}{92406}Who is it?
{92447}{92516}Michele, I forgot my keys.
{92737}{92766}Just a moment...
{93037}{93117}This'll teach you a lesson|for next time.
{93130}{93210}Ah, it'll teach me a lesson, eh?|While you...
{93242}{93287}Come closer,|I want to ask you something.
{93291}{93318}What?
{93357}{93418}I want to tell you that I don't like|you marrying that peasant.
{93443}{93479}How dare you!
{93648}{93781}God, this hurts! God, God, God...
{93785}{93853}- Did I hurt you?|- Yes...
{94167}{94239}{y:i}Meanwhile Cosimo was thinking of|{y:i}revenge: Peppe and his friends
{94243}{94381}{y:i}would not enjoy the fruit|"of their betrayal".
{95476}{95502}We're closed.
{95506}{95541}Just a moment.
{95659}{95688}Here you go, ma'am.
{96097}{96135}Do you know it?
{96224}{96323}Sure I know it. It's a small caliber|Baretta, in very poor condition.
{96335}{96360}One thousand lira.
{96450}{96473}Well?
{98092}{98112}Wanna dance?
{98116}{98162}No. I've taken a pledge.
{98405}{98533}Well... maybe... you like me|'cause you're an extrovert,
{98600}{98639}my opposite.
{98712}{98773}I, on the other hand, internalize.
{98795}{98903}Maybe 'cause I've always been|alone, I've suffered a lot in my life.
{98993}{99132}Happiness is like a flower that,|you p-p-pluck only once.
{99273}{99322}Listen, why don't we get out|of here,
{99329}{99430}I'd love to be alone|with you for a bit.
{99434}{99463}Oh, poor devil!
{99494}{99595}Why? It's only so|we can talk better.
{99606}{99754}To get to know each other.|Any place will do.
{99763}{99980}Your place, my place.|It doesn't matter.
{99984}{100007}- My place?|- Yes.
{100011}{100044}What about my aunts?
{100044}{100155}You're contradicting yourself|You're not all that clear then!
{100174}{100263}I'm sorry but you said that your|...aunts leave now and then,
{100267}{100321}and they leave the house|unattended...
{100326}{100353}Yes, it's true.
{100360}{100563}So what? No. Let's be honest from|day one. Otherwise suspicion,
{100567}{100645}the real kiss of death for love,|seeps in.
{100649}{100740}Slow down, who said love?|It's all in your head.
{100754}{100792}If you really want to know,
{100796}{100852}I've also asked|Guido and Fernando here.
{100890}{100910}Them too!
{100924}{100983}I'm a well brought up girl|you know!
{100995}{101081}I can't go dancing with one guy|only. It would compromise me.
{101113}{101209}What you need to learn is that you|must date me and me alone.
{101231}{101268}I date whom I please.
{101327}{101368}- Hello, Guido.|- Hi!
{101386}{101430}- Hi!|- Where are you going?
{101434}{101476}Let go of me.|Leave me alone. Don't be rude.
{101498}{101575}Fine, but remember that|I don't take anybody back,
{101584}{101613}not even with apologies.
{101634}{101659}What do I care?
{102008}{102047}What a tramp!
{102153}{102198}She's playing hard to get?
{102250}{102279}She's not worth the bother.
{102461}{102545}Listen Peppe, believe me,|let's leave it.
{102597}{102693}It started like nothing, and now|it's blown out of proportion.
{102701}{102760}Damn her!
{103008}{103097}Don't you agree?|I'm talking to you!
{103113}{103157}What do you want?|Leave me alone!
{103282}{103369}This jerk! He gets all worked up|about it. You were playing so cool.
{103382}{103442}Have you fallen in love|with that maid?
{103474}{103502}Those two, I...
{103515}{103537}Come here!
{103543}{103566}Move,
{103685}{103709}and you get out of the way!
{103738}{103758}Ah, here again?
{103827}{103859}You're cute, aren't you?
{103927}{103958}What are you laughing at?
{103962}{104021}What? Since when is laughing|forbidden? It's Mardis Gras!
{104081}{104139}And any joke is good, right?
{104198}{104353}Anyway, I am partner at a...|at a funeral home, right?
{104516}{104560}And I am his partner.
{104644}{104696}Well, share this one then!
{104943}{104969}Oh, God!
{105441}{105462}Oh, our Lady!
{105539}{105638}Have you gone insane!|For that tramp of a peasant!
{105648}{105696}If there's a tramp here, that's you.|I don't even know you!
{105708}{105797}Ah, you don't know me?|But I know you.
{105822}{105886}- Colonel's daughter all right!|- Let's go, c'mon.
{105890}{105931}You're a servant,|that's what you are!
{105935}{105982}- Who? Who's a servant?|- You!
{106310}{106345}They've disfigured me.
{106349}{106408}- Would you cut it out? You've spoiled it!|- Let's see, you owe me
{106412}{106518}four sodas, six Coca Colas,|two cream sodas and one beer.
{106553}{106650}Did I drink it all?
{106654}{106747}Not drank, smashed. Wait a minute...
{106751}{106852}there're also two glasses,|one chair and an ashtray.
{106867}{106944}- When?|- It's all written here!
{106948}{106988}You're telling me?
{107049}{107148}Fine, fine, I'll pay...|Right now I don't have any cash...
{107155}{107184}send me the bill home, right?
{107188}{107244}- Fine, what's your name?|- What?
{107248}{107275}What's your name?
{107333}{107486}Capannelle, Capannelle Pierluigi,|Circonvallazione Latina 457.
{107508}{107539}Four, five, seven.
{107648}{107694}What do you want?
{107760}{107787}Let me see.
{107811}{107900}- I don't know you...|- C'mon...
{107965}{107996}this is bad.
{108000}{108091}'This is bad'?|It's all your fault!
{108095}{108123}- Mine?|- Sure.
{108131}{108196}And that one, who was she?
{108274}{108340}Well, one of my conquests.
{108380}{108456}She saw you with me and,|and she got jealous.
{108544}{108647}Do you, do you believe what|she said about me?
{108676}{108702}Well...
{108762}{108786}no.
{109060}{109144}Well, it's true...|I work as domestic help.
{109278}{109392}What does it matter? We're a|democratic country, are we not?
{109443}{109489}But I won't do the laundry!
{109599}{109628}Easy...
{109747}{109790}- Better?|- No.
{109880}{109915}Still, this is the last time|I go out with you.
{109919}{109940}Why?
{109944}{109990}Why? You fight in the street,|you fight at the amusement park,
{109994}{110023}you fight at the dance.
{110058}{110103}It's better if we do|it your way, then.
{110141}{110160}My way?
{110189}{110214}We go to my place.
{110264}{110299}- To... to your place?!|- Yes...
{110365}{110389}This way? Right now?
{110393}{110496}Not right now. Those ones,|my mistresses, aren't home.
{110510}{110561}Thursday night, they'll leave|for Genzano
{110565}{110600}and will be back the morning after.
{110613}{110663}Is that right? Great! Great!
{110671}{110705}- I'll make you dinner, right?|- Thanks.
{110714}{110800}Oh, God I can't laugh, it hurts.|Don't make me laugh!
{110826}{110845}Don't make me laugh!
{110849}{110945}"But at the same time"...
{112836}{112913}Help... help! Stop, thief.|Help! Let go of me!
{112917}{113000}I'm not a thief! What do you want?
{113046}{113127}Stop. Thief... help! Low life!
{113140}{113266}Stop, thief, he's stolen my handbag!
{113661}{113707}Today good news,
{113751}{113840}to... tomorrow bad... Oh, well!
{113904}{114007}Right it's like the proverb says:|Feast or famine.
{114160}{114192}- Hi, Mario.|- Hi.
{114480}{114503}He looks as though|he were sleeping.
{114570}{114590}Aren't you going in?
{114623}{114734}No. I prefer to remember him alive.
{114767}{114786}I'm going.
{114832}{114859}Wait...
{115040}{115064}here!
{115213}{115292}He'd been going down the slippery|slope for a while, poor Cosimo!
{115302}{115430}A professional like him stooping|down to muggings... that's kid's stuff!
{115450}{115518}The best ones are always|first to go.
{115537}{115614}That's life. Today is your turn,|tomorrow's his.
{115634}{115710}Right, and sooner or later|we all have to go!
{115742}{115828}As far as I am concerned,|better later than sooner.
{116033}{116072}- Hi.|- Hi.
{116076}{116138}- Hi.|- Poor sod.
{116173}{116220}What's this?|You show up with the kid?
{116231}{116269}What am I supposed to do?
{116273}{116328}He cries all the time,|this is fun for him.
{116343}{116461}Fine, but it's time for you|to park him somewhere.
{116466}{116488}Why?
{116547}{116612}It's on for tomorrow night.
{116621}{116645}Tomorrow night?
{116649}{116693}Right, the owners'll be away,
{116698}{116735}and the girl is letting me in.
{116748}{116793}How can we? With the dead|still fresh in the grave?
{116799}{116839}What do you observe?|Strict mourning?
{116843}{116944}As the saying goes: You're dead|but they're still dancing.
{116948}{116990}Fine, right... you're right...
{117025}{117106}I'm sorry about Cosimo, still...|It's his fault too,
{117129}{117177}yes... yes...|if he'd only listened to me...
{117230}{117277}- C'mon... here.|- Guys, the chief of police!
{117333}{117366}Scram.
{117480}{117576}"The big day".
{117724}{117767}Who's that? Look,|it's Teresa's baby!
{117776}{117816}What's up?|She didn't want him in here?
{117822}{117913}Poor love! That husband of hers|is a fine looking guy, really!
{118019}{118115}It's Teresa's baby! He's so gorgeous!|Come here... come...
{118119}{118204}Shut up! Calm down.|Hold it. Shut up!
{118299}{118339}- Look who's here.|- Hi.
{118395}{118417}Hi.
{118463}{118526}- How are you?|- Well so-so... and you?
{118532}{118593}Not too bad. Here.
{118598}{118638}Poor darling!
{118734}{118827}Listen here. Didn't I tell you|I didn't want him inside?
{118846}{118896}- It's on for tonight.|- Right.
{118900}{118967}In case something might happen,|it shouldn't though, eh...
{118971}{119014}Knowing you,|it will happen for sure.
{119018}{119060}Teresa!
{119094}{119147}What's up with this creature?
{119156}{119227}Is he doing it? Doing it regularly?
{119231}{119310}- For sure! Even three times a day!|- Three times a day?!
{119316}{119365}There's something wrong then,|poor little star!
{119376}{119500}I say: Isn't it that to save time|you've been feeding him your food?
{119504}{119587}No, more like the opposite,|I've been eating his baby food...
{119591}{119640}one spoon for you and one for me.|One for you and one for me...
{119644}{119677}Look here, I've lost four pounds!
{119681}{119761}Ah, poor love! I'd like to know...
{119765}{119836}How have you dressed|this poor creature?
{119846}{119887}And these underpants,|whose are they?
{119894}{119922}They're mine.
{119926}{119979}I haven't even had the time|to do the laundry.
{119991}{120062}Actually, here, these two little rags|need to be washed.
{120066}{120095}This too!?
{120099}{120166}Here, the biscuits, here,|the baby food.
{120179}{120262}Careful, the vitamins|are in the sugar can.
{120272}{120318}And the sugar in the talc can.
{120331}{120414}- Home is such a mess!|- I believe you!
{120420}{120475}There, fine.
{120511}{120597}See you.|Listen, if it turns out all right,
{120608}{120671}get me a new mattress|for when I get home,
{120680}{120745}I'm dying to sleep on a proper bed!
{120763}{120796}Not to sleep with me, eh?
{120800}{120878}Sure, sure, of course!|Sure I want to sleep with you,
{120882}{120952}still, take care of that mattress.|Bye.
{120960}{120997}Bye... bye!
{121483}{121498}Who is it?
{121515}{121575}Michele! I forgot the keys.
{121583}{121672}Mario, don't be stupid.|My brother is due any minute now.
{121684}{121722}Give me a kiss and leave...
{121848}{121932}Open up! You shameless woman!
{121952}{121973}Open up!
{121993}{122055}To you and to you!|Don't be afraid!
{122067}{122115}Let me take a good look at you,|so brazen faced!
{122125}{122153}Dear Lady, I wanna marry him.
{122157}{122195}You've been speaking to Mario?
{122199}{122297}Who's gonna marry you now?|Here, look here.
{122301}{122370}There's only one heart in my breast|and I wanna give it to Mario!
{122374}{122438}I swear he's dead. This knife here,
{122442}{122540}is made to make|you cry tears of blood!
{122546}{122570}Michele!
{122604}{122636}Michele, no!
{122669}{122724}If this vengeance goes my way,|you won't see him anymore!
{122803}{122871}- A crow bar in two sections.|- Yes, right...
{122941}{122966}Blunt.
{122978}{123009}Blunt.
{123073}{123163}A dancer... that is a circular saw...
{123171}{123204}- D'you know how to use it?|- Sure!
{123289}{123341}- With an attached oiling gadget...|- Yes, sure...
{123345}{123471}Here we have a lubricating spout.
{123588}{123637}- Blunt spout?|- Of course, blunt.
{123643}{123688}Here are a few spare tips.
{123753}{123787}Chisel.
{123809}{123854}- Blunt?|- Right, blunt.
{123873}{123957}It's blunt all right. It has no tip.
{123961}{124043}Well, what do you pretend?
{124050}{124098}I've rented the other one|this morning
{124107}{124167}to that famous gang from Milan,
{124171}{124221}the one behind the famous|Swiss jeweler job,
{124285}{124363}it's been a busy week...|right, very busy...
{124380}{124469}- I've rented 3 complete kits|in 5 days! - Really!
{124473}{124557}Thank God,|business has taken off again.
{124568}{124603}It's very busy.
{124619}{124670}So, let's go on:
{124736}{124832}Three files, ten keys, one spear,
{124851}{124970}a cheese grater,|where's the plunger? Here it is.
{124999}{125168}One frying pan, and lastly,|the crank.
{125253}{125371}Right, let's sum up, briefly.
{125415}{125558}Listen here. To make a hole|in that wall... right?
{125562}{125616}How do you go about it|using the crank?
{125724}{125857}Right... we... we take all the furniture|in the flat...
{125891}{126004}and we make a sort of a column...|between the two walls... and...
{126027}{126100}and in the middle we...|we stick the crank.
{126116}{126173}Good, very good!
{126187}{126222}Here, gimme here...
{126240}{126338}And now, a little signature|on the bottom here.
{126342}{126398}- What signature?|- What, what signature?
{126417}{126474}And the guarantee?
{126497}{126580}This is capital! I need a receipt.
{126591}{126691}If I were greedy, I would have|asked for a deposit. Instead...
{126721}{126744}Will you sign?
{126808}{126840}I say, will you sign?
{126864}{126930}Good night! Are you slow?
{126936}{126965}Gimme here, go on, I'll sign it.
{126970}{127028}Let's just hurry up, it's already 7:30.
{127398}{127427}You've got penmanship, eh?
{127431}{127489}Be good, be good, let me sign it.
{127523}{127575}Right. The wrapping,|that is to say the suitcase.
{127579}{127623}I'll leave it, right, guys!
{127628}{127672}- Here you go. Did you do it?|- Here you go!
{127792}{127821}Oh, were you in China?
{127846}{127875}And, and this suitcase here?
{127880}{127934}This is my very own: I'm leaving.
{127946}{127985}How come you're leaving?
{127995}{128134}My friend, when there's a robbery,|I never hang around!
{128167}{128216}I go to Spoleto, to my dear aunt.
{128230}{128333}Of course with my parole|officer's consent,
{128350}{128439}one can never be too careful!|Remember guys,
{128450}{128573}one can never be too careful!|Break a leg!
{128687}{128826}He's right. We've gotta keep an|eye out and work scientifically!
{128844}{128883}Hi.
{128894}{128938}Well, you're exaggerating now.|What are we going to do?
{128942}{128991}We'll break the safe with the...
{129015}{129051}Death stared me in the face!
{129055}{129079}What happened to you?
{129083}{129165}I met the guy we stole|the camera from...
{129169}{129182}What did he do?
{129186}{129232}Don't touch. He tore my arm off.
{129236}{129286}- He broke your arm?|- Forty days!
{129297}{129316}And you, nothing!
{129320}{129371}What should I have done?|I didn't even feel the pain.
{129375}{129397}It was more the fright.
{129401}{129430}Was he the guy from|Porta Portese?
{129434}{129484}The very one! He took me|the whole way home
{129488}{129525}and I had to give him|the camera back.
{129529}{129576}That'll teach you to show up|in time.
{129580}{129630}If you'd come in earlier,|you wouldn't have met him!
{129634}{129667}Right, 'if you'd come in earlier'.|I "was" early!
{129671}{129725}That's exactly why I came in late.
{129730}{129779}Fine, it doesn't matter. Listen up!
{129811}{129855}Easy, it hurts!
{129899}{129973}I'm meeting the girl at 9 pm
{129982}{130047}On the ninth, didn't we say today?
{130060}{130158}Capannelle! At 9 pm today.|Understood?
{130162}{130197}Understood.
{130201}{130298}You, you'll be ready behind the|newstand around eleven thirty.
{130302}{130434}The newspaper stand, right?|At twelve I'll open the lobby door.
{130445}{130602}I say midnight because, follow me,|at twelve those who are home
{130606}{130707}are sleeping and those at the|movies still have to come back.
{130714}{130766}Understood? Clear?
{130781}{130848}- Not clear at all!|- Why?
{130852}{130960}First of all, what are you going|to do with this girl
{130964}{131002}once you're in the apartment?
{131023}{131113}Well, I don't know.|I haven't thought about it yet...
{131117}{131168}A good whack on the head, right?
{131172}{131242}Fine, fine, I'll take care of it.|Just take it easy.
{131265}{131395}It's, it's 7:34 pm.|Set your watches. Let's go.
{131399}{131463}- Get lost! Well?|- Doesn't anybody have a watch?
{131467}{131523}A watch, who's got that?
{131527}{131601}I did, but I pawned it.
{131610}{131673}Anyway, tonight|I'm gonna get it back.
{131729}{131764}Oh, finally!
{131801}{131851}You've dishonored my home!
{131857}{131882}Are you crazy?
{131905}{131946}I'm gonna tear my sister|from your chest!
{131950}{131983}Put the knife down! Are you stupid?
{131987}{132007}What do you want?|Have you gone insane?
{132011}{132043}Who touched my sister...|Let me go, Capannelle!
{132047}{132081}You'll get thirty years.
{132085}{132116}Don't move. Don't be a kid!
{132120}{132154}Be good! Have you lost it?
{132201}{132261}Do you wanna spoil it all,|right tonight?
{132265}{132314}- I demand satisfaction!|- Fine!
{132318}{132408}First of all, if he stays in tonight,|just forget about me.
{132424}{132550}Easy. Your sister,|I haven't touched her at all.
{132582}{132640}I'm serious about her. I love her.
{132705}{132771}I would have already told you|if you weren't so thick.
{132867}{132962}Go ahead and stay,|because I am leaving.
{132973}{133017}So? What are you going to do?
{133055}{133139}I've given it a lot of thought|and I don't have the guts for it.
{133162}{133189}Are you crazy?
{133255}{133286}Maybe.
{133332}{133383}But you are wise guys,|aren't you?
{133407}{133445}Cosimo was a wise guy too.
{133472}{133559}We've got it in our heads|to pull the job of our life,
{133574}{133628}but it doesn't work this way|for the like of us.
{133653}{133684}At least for the likes of me.
{133723}{133749}And there's my mother too.
{133753}{133817}What will she do if something|happens to me?
{133863}{133914}Anyway, I've already gotten|myself a little job.
{133921}{133950}At the Follie's theatre.
{133994}{134046}If you want satisfaction,|I'll be there.
{134348}{134379}Boys!
{134419}{134506}I've had it! I really had it!
{134545}{134625}One's got a sister, the other|his mother, another one the kid.
{134664}{134766}What's up? We've gotta make up|our minds now.
{134809}{134852}Are we going through with this job|or not?
{134865}{134914}- Are you in or are you out?|- Yes...
{134985}{135024}- Who's that?|- Shush! Quiet!
{135107}{135120}Who's there?
{135124}{135146}It's me!
{135150}{135205}That's Nicoletta.|Move, move, get out!
{135223}{135254}Out of that window.
{135271}{135326}- Quick!|- Move... damn you.
{135475}{135503}Ah!
{135534}{135562}So... what's up?
{135792}{135857}My poor shoulder! Damn it! I've|been walking around for two hours!
{135866}{135914}Come in, come in!
{135962}{136001}How, how did you find me?
{136009}{136082}I heard you giving the address|to the ballroom guy,
{136086}{136126}for that stuff you'd broken, right?
{136133}{136242}What a...! That's why they came|here looking for money, see!
{136262}{136348}He's... he's my brother-in-law.|This is his place...
{136380}{136407}I'm his brother-in-law.
{136427}{136492}Right now, poor man,|he's... he's unemployed and...
{136517}{136641}so now and then I come here to...|to help him out... right?
{136676}{136718}I'm collecting unemployment.
{136732}{136761}Sit down, sit down.
{136772}{136858}Ah, ah, ah! It's always so messy!
{136883}{136931}Be careful, good God!
{137038}{137074}Well, let's see...
{137132}{137171}You needn't feel ashamed|about me anymore!
{137214}{137238}Pardon?
{137260}{137295}I've quit!
{137420}{137483}How... what do you mean...|you've quit?
{137524}{137598}Those two old hags...|I was their slave.
{137643}{137717}First moving, and then this furniture|goes here, and that goes there...
{137722}{137761}I was never right about|a single thing.
{137784}{137885}Dust this, polish that,|go shopping, and the cats' litter!
{137906}{138024}So I let it all out,|we're made of flesh too.
{138037}{138122}When they were about ready to|leave for Genzano, I told them:
{138129}{138229}My dears, I'm sorry but this time|you are staying home. I'm leaving!
{138296}{138336}Well. What does she mean?
{138340}{138390}That dumb head didn't let them go?
{138394}{138462}I had to let you know because|that date we had in that house
{138466}{138546}is no longer possible, you know...
{138592}{138618}Right...
{138630}{138728}Now I better leave because the|nuns where I'll be staying tonight,
{138732}{138790}close the doors at nine.|Could you walk me, right?
{138815}{138862}What? Walk you?
{138866}{138983}No, I have to... I have to...|stay here with him, poor soul!
{139004}{139115}Well, never mind. I'll go on my own.|I won't forget today too easily...
{139140}{139182}Oh, my God, the keys!
{139234}{139282}I had them! Damn it!
{139311}{139346}Better: I'll throw them in the river.
{139361}{139401}So when they'll come back|the two hags
{139405}{139437}will have to knock down the door!
{139469}{139502}Sorry, what did you just say?
{139554}{139655}Didn't you say that the two|old hags stayed home?
{139663}{139752}Right! As if they'd listen when|I speak! They're so selfish.
{139775}{139868}To spite me, they left cats|and everything and went.
{139894}{140001}- So the house, it's empty?|- Yes...
{140043}{140086}...and you... you have the keys.
{140090}{140123}What's does that have|to do with anything?
{140132}{140179}- Fine, goodbye...|- Bye.
{140187}{140214}- See you.|- See you?
{140218}{140279}Aren't you walking her there?|She's got the keys...
{140288}{140311}Which keys?
{140315}{140366}How, which keys? You walk her...
{140370}{140443}Ah! She has... ah!|Ah! Right, that's right!
{140447}{140489}I'm coming, I'm coming too!
{140493}{140520}The keys.
{140524}{140587}There's someone who|watches over us!
{140713}{140749}- You know what?|- What?
{140764}{140818}I'm really starting to like you.
{140884}{140912}Same here.
{140945}{141021}But with good intentions|or do you only like me?
{141071}{141194}I... I... like you
{141206}{141261}and with good intentions too.
{141687}{141727}You take my breath away...
{141792}{141819}We're nearly there.
{141847}{141869}Will I see you tomorrow?
{141873}{141976}Eh! Sure I'll see you, of course.|I want to.
{141999}{142065}Ah! No. I can't tomorrow... I can't.
{142120}{142235}I have to go to Milan... it's for|business you know. I'm sorry.
{142240}{142263}Will you stay long?
{142287}{142386}No, I'll be back soon and when|I'll be back... I'll see you...
{142390}{142463}I'll see you right away! Of course!
{142484}{142540}- Could you do me a favor?|- Sure.
{142551}{142602}Could you drop the keys|with the doorman?
{142650}{142751}But didn't you say you were going|to throw them in the river?
{142762}{142810}Yes...|Sometimes one just says things.
{142836}{142914}Should anything happen,|it would be my fault.
{142935}{142976}4|And... and what could happen?
{142982}{143026}Say... a fire.
{143039}{143087}It would be my fault|if I didn't leave the keys
{143091}{143157}with the doorman and he couldn't|get in. Say they'll steal something...
{143182}{143252}Oh, God, where did I put them?|Virgin Mary!
{143258}{143293}Who would want to steal?
{143303}{143340}Oh, God, where are they?
{143401}{143469}Four years at their service|and I never mislaid a single thing.
{143528}{143563}Oh God! I lost them,
{143584}{143636}what am I going to do now?|They won't believe me, you know?
{143652}{143720}Easy, take it easy. Let's see...
{143742}{143887}in the bottom of the bag...|here they are, here, see?
{143891}{143994}Damn it, you women! Head|in the clouds. Here they are.
{144072}{144108}Will you go right away?|Could you do it for me?
{144112}{144146}Sure, sure...
{144194}{144307}- This is me. Ciao, eh!|- Bye.
{144313}{144342}- Come back soon.|- Fine.
{144533}{144645}Please don't forget the keys|or I'll get in trouble!
{144663}{144718}I'm telling you not to worry. Bye...
{144818}{144840}bye...
{145041}{145114}Fifty, sixty... eighty...
{145230}{145294}eight and five...|...one hundred and fifteen.
{145315}{145341}Mario!
{145461}{145482}What do you want?
{145612}{145720}Where I am from we say: Only God|knows if it'll turn out right or rotten.
{145735}{145764}So what?
{145784}{145823}Well if the rotten part happens,
{145827}{145891}I would beg you|to look after my sister.
{145950}{146002}Respectfully, that is.
{146024}{146080}Well, if that's the case I hope|they will catch you.
{146249}{146319}Fine, sure, don't worry.
{146562}{146605}Carmelina is locked inside,
{146639}{146705}I have installed one more lock.
{146722}{146794}- Why?|- Because of you.
{146818}{146850}And I was wrong.
{146884}{146963}You're a good young man|who loves his mother.
{146983}{147114}And you're right,|'cause we only have one!
{147191}{147236}Of course...
{147510}{147551}Popcorn, candy!
{148030}{148074}- Well?|- No keys.
{148079}{148133}- Didn't you manage to get them?|- No.
{148137}{148211}Damn him, he's joking...|C'mon, take them out!
{148222}{148332}I'm not joking.|She ran away suddenly...
{148348}{148426}she jumped on the tram|and that was that.
{148430}{148481}- No keys.|- Damn.
{148485}{148551}- Lf... if... if...|- Listen here, you gotta tell me
{148555}{148650}who told you to go about|things scientifically!
{148654}{148716}- Give me here...|- What do you want? And you?
{148725}{148754}Who told you we need the keys?
{148758}{148883}Right, because you, you|won't go ahead without the keys?
{148906}{148955}I'm sure you want|the safe's keys too.
{148972}{148994}Sure.
{148998}{149084}How had we worked it out, before|that wretched girl showed up?
{149107}{149188}Coal bin... courtyard... window!
{149196}{149216}Window, right...
{149220}{149302}Fine, let's move it... Pliers!
{149324}{149373}- You Capanne'...|- What?
{149401}{149502}You'll be on the look out.|Let's go. Quick!
{150520}{150546}Ferribotte,
{150748}{150792}gimme the suitcase.
{150818}{150902}Slide down, you're good,|there's a pile of coal.
{150916}{150967}Go, go easy.
{151044}{151079}Did you land on the coal?
{151105}{151173}What coal? It's sewage!
{151285}{151320}It stinks! C'mon.
{151379}{151418}Easy, my arm!
{151422}{151470}You can't think about your arm|right now!
{152252}{152310}I keep taking my hat on and off.
{152732}{152755}Ferribotte,
{152821}{152854}gimme a hand!
{152858}{152898}I was drying myself off!
{153324}{153383}Bag, tools,
{153560}{153594}you idiot.
{153601}{153636}I thought it was locked.
{153722}{153746}Let's keep moving.
{153801}{153825}Quickly!
{154143}{154218}Lock it now. First one, go in!
{154816}{154861}- What's up!|- I banged my arm.
{154866}{154904}- Quiet.|- It hurts, no!
{154908}{154940}I told you to keep quiet!
{154953}{155040}C'mon... what a guy!
{155353}{155388}Go on, move!
{155476}{155497}Take it easy!
{155509}{155554}It wasn't me, you know!
{155915}{155965}C'mon, move it.
{156215}{156249}These were brand new!
{156502}{156584}- C'mon, c'mon!|- Easy, easy.
{156866}{156918}Wait, first one,
{156947}{156967}go on, c'mon.
{157455}{157495}You're so heavy! Damn it!
{157740}{157766}Hurry up!
{157959}{158008}- Don't talk!|- Ah, help me!
{158012}{158057}- Silence, quiet! I told you to keep quiet!|- Easy!
{158062}{158091}Silence!
{158140}{158221}- Don't pull me this way!|- Keep quiet!
{158522}{158549}First one go on...
{158553}{158591}Who's this 'Firstone' anyway?
{158633}{158736}Whomever, let's go, follow him.
{159344}{159360}I don't want to stay here.
{159365}{159383}Why not?
{159387}{159408}Because I don't want to.
{159412}{159427}Isn't it comfortable?
{159432}{159468}You haven't been honest with me!
{159472}{159515}Me? You haven't been honest|with me!
{159519}{159607}This isn't true. I was always|honest with you. Ask Adelaide.
{159611}{159638}She is a good one to ask!
{159642}{159713}Why should I believe you but|you won't believe her?
{159717}{159761}What are you saying!? You|can't compare me with Adelaide.
{159765}{159816}What's wrong with Adelaide?
{159820}{159868}I don't like her,|that's what's wrong.
{159872}{159907}And I don't like staying here.|I've already told you!
{159911}{159933}What's wrong with it?
{159937}{159966}Nothing, but I don't want to stay!
{159970}{159991}Tell me why?
{159995}{160040}'Cause you haven't been honest.
{160045}{160087}Because you've lied to me!
{160091}{160131}Yes! You're ducking so that|you won't get hit!
{160135}{160206}Imagine, "I" duck!|That's you and you know why!
{160210}{160261}No, I really don't know|what you mean...
{160265}{160300}You know it very well!
{160304}{160370}C'mon, let's hear it!|What do you know very well?
{160374}{160398}I don't feel like telling you!
{160402}{160455}Well suit yourself, but I won't stay|here a minute longer.
{160459}{160488}- Why?|- Because I don't want to.
{160493}{160523}Well, you said you would before!
{160528}{160564}And now you're touching me?
{160568}{160612}What did we come here for, then?
{160616}{160684}Because I was mistaken...|I thought you were honest!
{160688}{160742}Tell me, when haven't I been|honest with you?
{160746}{160775}You know it! You know it!
{160779}{160824}Well, you, you listen to that|Adelaide. That's your problem.
{160829}{160865}I don't want to stay here,|d'you hear me?
{160869}{160907}Answer me, though! Am I or|am I not right when I'm saying
{160911}{160942}you listen too much to Adelaide?
{160946}{161001}That isn't true! I've always|been honest with you.
{161005}{161041}The same here.|You must believe me!
{161045}{161069}That's not true!|I'm telling you!
{161073}{161112}Listen, I don't want to stay here!
{161122}{161147}Tell me, tell me why?
{161151}{161163}I won't.
{161167}{161189}You don't like it?
{161193}{161232}Yes, I do like it, but you're a liar.
{161236}{161285}Me? You lied to me first.
{161289}{161344}That's not true!|I've always been honest with you!
{161348}{161366}Listen...
{161370}{161395}Right, I don't want to stay here!
{161399}{161425}Ah, won't you tell me why?
{161429}{161496}I don't know how else to tell you.|You haven't been honest with me!
{161500}{161562}Here we go! When you don't know|what to say, you tell me I am lying!
{161566}{161633}Because you are! Listen, I don't|want to stay here anymore!
{161637}{161686}But first you said yes!|See it's you, not me.
{162031}{162111}Ah! We're on the horse's back...|carry on.
{162164}{162312}It's slippery.|I won't make it, you know.
{162380}{162442}Don't worry, trust me.
{162515}{162573}- We're going down here, it seems.|- Quiet!
{162724}{162760}- What happened?|- Keep quiet,
{162796}{162825}all of you quiet!
{163148}{163175}Here's the window.
{163384}{163414}Here we are boys.
{163658}{163728}- All ready to go?|- Yes... yes...
{163820}{163844}Careful...
{164248}{164336}- The plun... the plun...|- The plunger, I know.
{164662}{164748}Here, here...|take it away, take it away.
{164752}{164834}- Slowly, you're cutting my hand.|- Don't cut me, hear me?
{165576}{165603}Get down!
{165607}{165746}I'm exhausted. When I think that|girl nearly dropped us the keys...
{165891}{165958}Hold it, hold it!
{166172}{166220}Here. Here's the dining room.
{166315}{166389}- No, I'm wrong.|- This is the dining room.
{166414}{166441}Strange,
{166526}{166539}turn it on.
{166543}{166607}Don't turn it on,|first shut the window.
{166671}{166744}This is the wall.|Let's move the furniture.
{166863}{166892}Help me.
{167214}{167281}Hey tap it quietly, or|you'll wake the whole building.
{167285}{167329}I have to try it one way|or the other!
{167425}{167473}- I'd try this way!|- Yes!
{167477}{167551}Let's do it scientifically.
{167690}{167738}- Go on!|- Easy...
{167859}{167954}Oh, it's as soft as cheese.|Oh, God!
{167987}{168124}What are you doing?|Spot on the water pipe!
{168339}{168383}The light, turn off the light!
{168846}{168874}Shush!
{168988}{169043}Hello? Hello?
{169063}{169102}Mrs. Ciarrocchi?
{169128}{169173}I'm Fernando the night porter...
{169230}{169279}No, nothing.|Everything's fine here...
{169343}{169407}yes, yes, the girl's left.
{169444}{169482}No, she didn't take anything...
{169486}{169527}Yes, don't worry.
{169559}{169633}I've called you because|you said to call you
{169638}{169754}as soon as they return the keys,|no matter what time...
{169774}{169841}So I called. Was I wrong?
{169845}{169987}No! Yes, I have the keys,|don't worry ma'am...
{170007}{170133}The cats?|The cats are a little filthy.
{170179}{170251}Well, a little filthy, there.
{170261}{170370}Yes, it's dropped one right now|and run away.
{170381}{170450}I'm telling you,|in the dining room.
{170461}{170520}Yes... just wait a second...
{170525}{170591}I'll grab it and I'll let it out... Right?
{170806}{170858}Damn it! You filthy fiend!
{170950}{170994}Hello? Hello, ma'am?
{170998}{171042}Yes, yes, I got it...
{171056}{171128}The keys? No, they didn't bring|them back right now,
{171132}{171218}they brought them back while I|was waiting for my sister-in-law...
{171248}{171298}No, I didn't get them from Nicoletta.
{171302}{171397}I got them from a guy who said|he was her fiancé!
{171418}{171518}Well... He was a tall guy,|this tall, what do I know!?
{171548}{171659}Don't worry ma'am, right.|See you soon. Take care!
{171806}{171889}You wretch, miserable wretch!
{171897}{171956}What? If we'd come in|with the keys,
{171961}{171990}it wouldn't have been burglary
{171995}{172035}and we'd have been off the hook|for aggravating circumstance.
{172053}{172199}You're so stupid!|You're such cretins!
{172210}{172254}Don't you know why I did it?
{172362}{172427}- It's my alibi.|- Alibi?
{172431}{172574}Sure! That guy, the night porter,|saw me and I gave him the keys.
{172589}{172655}And I'm fine, right?
{172659}{172705}It couldn't have been me...|And you're my friends!
{172724}{172788}Actually...|I thought it was serious thinking...
{172796}{172875}Ah, you had your serious thinking,|but you're telling us just now?
{172882}{172935}And we are so stupid as|to believe you!
{172939}{172987}We're in the hands of a madman,|we're...
{172991}{173035}- Captain Hook!|- Quiet!
{173043}{173134}I see! You've fallen for the maid!
{173141}{173231}Me? Me? Don't listen to him, eh!
{173247}{173322}Tomorrow, as soon as|we get the money,
{173327}{173384}we'll split and I'll never|see her again!
{173401}{173472}Imagine, me...
{173558}{173584}Well, and even if it were?
{173588}{173644}There was no need for her|to get involved.
{173652}{173759}What did I tell you?|He risks our skin, for a...
{173763}{173829}Quiet, I have an iron fist you know!
{173833}{173913}- An iron brain too!|- Hold it! Be serious!
{173917}{173980}What's this? You wanna|compromise everything
{173987}{174045}for a stupid issue? Look!|Follow your elders!
{174064}{174108}Help me.
{174120}{174182}C'mon you two!
{174187}{174235}The door's heavy you know!
{174264}{174304}C'mon, let's rest it there!
{174377}{174397}Did you pile up the books?
{174401}{174441}Here, this is the last one.
{174453}{174580}Fine. Don't let go.|The pan, who's got the pan?
{174585}{174678}I do. It's not like we're breaking|the safe too, right?
{174684}{174746}I wish! Move more to your left,|on the corner.
{174777}{174864}Ah, sweet safe!|I wonder what you're holding!
{174868}{174912}- Who can say?|- Quiet...
{174974}{174999}here we are!
{175124}{175146}I'm going.
{175181}{175235}There it goes...|Hear the click?
{175292}{175345}- Is the wall holding?|- Yes, yes, yes...
{175351}{175393}Good, good, it's giving way, there...
{175453}{175542}I'm not one of those guys that|gets some dough, squanders it
{175547}{175672}and ends up losing his shirt.
{175747}{175792}I'll get a little house|with four rooms
{175826}{175930}and a bank account for the kid,|so he can remember
{175935}{175992}all the sacrifices|his father's made for him...
{176072}{176173}And you know what I'll do?|I'll get a beautiful mistress, see!
{176196}{176323}I'll give her a monthly allowance|of 25,000 lira, perhaps 30.
{176367}{176425}But she pays for her food...
{176640}{176699}Here we go, it's giving in!
{176790}{176931}C'mon Capannelle!|Instead of talking mistresses,
{176935}{177040}go get me a glass of water,|I'm thirsty.
{177109}{177182}C'mon, Pe'! C'mon.
{177820}{177856}What are you doing there?
{177872}{177916}What are you doing there?
{177933}{177968}Mother!
{178023}{178066}What has happened?
{178261}{178291}Move!
{178364}{178408}That's the wrong wall.
{178567}{178602}Damn it!
{178651}{178704}We really blew it!
{178726}{178807}Nicoletta told me they'd moved|the furniture.
{178816}{178873}This was the dining room.
{178939}{178998}This is what happened|to the Rosetta's cook.
{179018}{179101}What cook?
{179114}{179164}We know which one is the|real wall, right?
{179185}{179244}We'll break it|and we'll end up right there.
{179249}{179285}- Right in jail.|- Why?
{179293}{179331}What are you thinking about?
{179335}{179394}We need an hour and a quarter|to make another hole,
{179398}{179450}when we're on the other|side at least two hours
{179454}{179565}with the circular saw,|look at the time... look at the time!
{179612}{179741}Well forget about it.|See all this labor,
{179745}{179814}all this danger for nothing, fine.|Understood?
{179922}{179949}Just see!
{180004}{180038}Good work, eh?
{180046}{180160}Good work yes, you see,|a skilled job, right?
{180168}{180298}Scientific, that's what I'm saying,|are we capitulating now?
{180313}{180429}Understood? And if we sped up?|The doors are already off,
{180447}{180535}I say we can make it, right?
{180562}{180588}What do you want?
{180617}{180632}This is good.
{180637}{180678}Leave me alone, understood?
{180701}{180760}Impossible. We'll never make it,
{180801}{180875}stealing is a serious profession|you need serious people,
{180879}{180960}not people like you.|All you can do at your best is work.
{180978}{181037}Working... I know,
{181087}{181122}but working is tiring.
{181162}{181177}This is really good.
{181182}{181227}I don't want it, what is it?
{181241}{181277}Pasta and beans.
{181285}{181330}Well, I say,|I got you all the way here.
{181338}{181390}If we had some mishap,|am I to blame?
{181414}{181489}Everything was clear,|all written down.
{181501}{181537}- Listen to me.|- This is so good...
{181541}{181595}Stop thinking, that's the best thing|you can do for yourself.
{181609}{181712}You're strong, hand and shovel,|that's your style.
{181759}{181822}How do you open it? Damn it...
{181826}{181937}See, see one of the burglars!|Pull it this way...
{182054}{182105}There's ice too, look!
{182128}{182255}So, you say forget about it, we'll|lose all the expense money too.
{182286}{182330}There are four meat wraps.
{182335}{182371}Who are you blaming?
{182452}{182505}You know this is not bad! Good...
{182512}{182563}Sure, Nicoletta made it!
{182585}{182699}If we wanted to be really picky, it|could do with an extra drop of oil.
{182822}{182868}Honestly. Here, taste it.
{182873}{182947}No... I don't think so.
{182952}{182993}I'll warm it up a little...
{183000}{183025}I like it this way.
{183189}{183206}Taste here, throw it down.
{183211}{183319}At home we say:|Saucy woman makes a good mistress,
{183334}{183404}bland woman a good wife.
{183439}{183465}Understand?
{183760}{183796}This is really good.|I was really hungry.
{183881}{184018}Boys. I'm afraid we've broken|the gas pipe. It doesn't light.
{184061}{184155}Oh, God help us! Saint Rosalie!
{184678}{184727}Hey, this is my tram.
{184749}{184813}See you, I'm going to prison|to pick up the kid.
{184844}{184867}See you...
{184939}{184988}Listen here, when will I see you?
{185023}{185044}Why?
{185057}{185094}Well!
{185104}{185173}The less we see each other,|the better. Bye.
{185239}{185298}Actually, I've never known you!
{185572}{185601}I'm a veteran.
{186018}{186044}Let's go, c'mon!
{186396}{186432}You... what are you doing now?
{186436}{186481}I'll wait for the 31.
{186495}{186521}Ciao!
{186949}{186985}So, where are you going now?
{187034}{187058}Well...
{187092}{187178}Well, well, well, I understand!
{187187}{187254}That maid, she's cute you know.
{187261}{187446}Quit, quit calling her maid, she's not|going back to that, she's too frail.
{187479}{187533}Here they come! Act cool.
{187833}{187907}Damn Capannelle. Stop that alarm.
{187912}{188026}Oh, mother, it's the alarm! I can't|shut it, it's not easy you know!
{188112}{188140}Let's turn around.
{188522}{188608}We've been out here two hours,|won't you open up? We're fed up!
{188748}{188791}Get back in line with the others,|c'mon.
{188795}{188942}Ah see! What are they distributing,|winter provisions?
{188952}{189025}C'mon, you know very well|they're calling out for work.
{189047}{189106}Work... let's split Capannelle... Go...
{189128}{189199}Let me go... I'm not in here,
{189217}{189261}I'm just passing by!|Let's go...
{189413}{189489}Let go of me, let me go.|I'll leave on my own. Let go.
{189613}{189653}I say,

Hello, love.
What have you got?
Peter called while you were out.
He left this for you.
Tour dates.
This is tomorrow...
Good evening.
The Song Remains The Same.
It's fucking true!
It comes only suddenly inside the building.
No, no, man. You know, one of those...
- Are they good?
- No, they're fucking terrible!
Those photos.
- Not again.
- They're very sexual.
I think we ought to be part of it.
When you give him a call, nobody knows.
This is a song that sometimes takes a building...
...in a manner which our forefathers were very used to.
Did you hear that?
It's right though, isn't it?
That feeling that's left everybody.
The cosmic energy!
Everybody cheers.
Jimmy Page, guitar.
Not fast enough.
This is called No Quarter.
Don't fucking talk to me. It's my bloody act. I think I'll leave you anytime.
You couldn't even give them a starting line.
Are you telling me you let...
It wouldn't happen in Europe!
I don't know how the guy got in the building.
This isn't Europe or England.
I can see that. You're so inefficient!
- Somebody got it.
- Talk to me.
I'm the manager for this group.
You had people inside this building selling posters...
...and you didn't know about it!
I didn't know about it. As soon as we found out about it, we stopped it.
As soon as we found out about it and told you, you stopped it!
All right, so you found out before I did.
How much kickback are you getting?
None. I knew nothing about it.
Come on! You don't know what the concession is?
Your mate's selling the T-shirts and making the deals.
And he told Richard about it also.
He came back, didn't he?
He does everything, doesn't he?
He does the security one night...
One night he's the guard of the fucking dressing room.
That's fucking typical, isn't it?
As long as we screw an extra few bob out of the group...
You really think I get something out of it?
You are the fucking controller!
That's like saying that anyone who jumps on the stage, I'm responsible for, too.
Of course not. You're responsible to see that the concessionaire...
You rented it. You controlled it.
Isn't selling fucking pirate posters.
You have to wait for someone else to tell you what it's doing.
It doesn't matter so long as there's an extra nickel to be drained.
By exploiting Led Zeppelin, it's great.
With the fucking Stars and Stripes behind it.
We never took a dime in concession yet.
On anything.
This is called The Song Remains The Same.
Any tickets for sale?
Any tickets for sale?
How many guys out there?
Two now.
We're in good shape. Only two.
Can we get in?
- Ask these guys. They're in charge.
- Can we get in?
If it's up to me, yeah.
Thank you!
Hey, thanks a lot!
A lot of fun!
Jimmy Page, electric guitar.
Do you expect trouble?
No comment.
That's all you're going to get.
No comment is more incriminating than a comment.
- Is it?
- Yes.
No comment.
I think this is a song of hope.
Our percussionist, John Bonham.
Moby Dick.
One hundred thirty pounds of glory,
John Bonham!
Led Zeppelin's road manager says
he put the money in the deposit box...
... and when he went back it was all gone.
The police say there was money in the box,
but they can't tell exactly how much.
The group's personal manager, Peter Grant,
discussed the theft...
... at a news conference today.
It's brought back by our attorney, physically carried...
...because that's his function...
...and when he comes back...
...it's put into a safe-deposit box.
Police said they were questioning anyone
who had access to the safe-deposit box...
... but that's all they would say.
The money is reportedly the largest amount ever taken...
...from a hotel safe-deposit box in New York City.
We asked the client, there wasn't money in the box.
Probably one of his clerks.
He noted one of the transactions.
Today was our leaving day, anyhow, so we had that amount of money...
...because we had to pay our airplanes and hotels.
After he met with newsmen,
police took Grant himself...
... and two of his employees
to the precinct for questioning.
New York, goodbye.

Life's not fair, is it?
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.
And you shall never see the light of another day.
Adieu.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
What do you want?
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony.
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
I quiver with fear!
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.
Help!
Scar?
Drop him.
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.
Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That was today?
I feel simply awful!
Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should've been first in line!
Well, I was first in line, until the little hairball was born.
That hairball is my son and your future king.
I shall practise my curtsy!
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Oh, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Is that a challenge?
Temper, temper.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity. Why not?
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.
But when it comes to brute strength,
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
There's one in every family, sire.
Two in mine, actually, and they always manage to ruin special occasions.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.
Simba.
Dad! Dad!
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!
Sorry.
Dad! Dad!
Your son is awake.
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad! Come on, Dad.
You promised.
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.
Yeah!
Look, Simba.
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time.
- There's more?
- Simba...
Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
Really?
What are you doing, son?
Pouncing.
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't...
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.
The cheetahs are hard up, but...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.
Very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...
This is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Mufasa? Simba?
That's very good.
- Zazu!
- Yes!
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Aw, dad, can't I come?
No, son.
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.
Oh, young master, one day, you will be king.
Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
I despise guessing games.
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.
Oh, goody!
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom, and I'm gonna rule it all!
Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping forjoy.
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar.
When I'm king, what'll that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border?
Well, no. He said I can't go there.
And he's absolutely right.
It's far too dangerous.
Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.
Why not?
I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favourite nephew.
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.
All the more reason for me to be protective.
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Oops!
An elephant what?
Oh, dear, I've said too much.
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all.
Just do me one favour.
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember, it's our little secret.
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.
Come on. I just heard about this great place.
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane!
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?
So, where are we going?
It better not be anyplace dumb.
No, it's really cool.
So, where is this really cool place?
Oh.
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
I'll show you when we get there.
Oh.
Mom, can I go with Simba?
What do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
Please?
It's all right with me.
- Yeah!
- All right!
As long as Zazu goes with you.
No, not Zazu.
Step lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
So, where are we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Zazu.
Right. So, how are we gonna ditch the dodo?
Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna.
Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all.
Be-what?
Betrothed. Intended.
Affianced.
Meaning...
One day, you two are going to be married.
- Yuck!
- Eww!
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice.
It's a tradition going back generations.
When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.
Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, he's the future king.
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.
Not yet, I don't.
And with an attitude like that,
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king, indeed.
Not the way I see it.

Simba?
Nala!
All right! It worked!
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!
Pinned ya again.
This is it. We made it.
It's really creepy.
Yeah.
Isn't it great?

I wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Wrong! The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.
Oh, man!
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
Look, banana beak is scared.
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy, and right now we are all in very real danger.
Danger?
I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here?
I don't know, Shenzi.
What do you think, Ed?
Just what I was thinking.
A trio of trespassers!
And quite by accident, let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
Wait, wait, wait.
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.
And that would make you...
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?
You can't do anything to me.
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.
But you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.
Yeah, we could have whatever's lion around!
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?
What, Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No, why?
'Cause there it goes!
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.
Where's Zazu?
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped all the way to the birdie-boiler.
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!
Aaaah!
Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
- Like you?
- Oops.
Boo!
Simba!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That was it?
Do it again. Come on.
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.
If you ever come near my son again...
Oh, this is... This is your son?
- Oh, your son.
- Did you know that?
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?
- No, of course not.
- No.
Ed?
Toodles.
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.
I thought you were very brave.
Zazu.
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala.
Simba, good luck.
Simba!
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
- I know.
- You could've been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me, and what's worse, you put Nala in danger.
I was just trying to be brave, like you.
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
I was today.
- You were?
- Yes.
I thought I might lose you.
I guess even kings get scared?
- But you know what?
- What?
I think those hyenas were even scareder.
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!
Come here!
Gotcha!
Dad?
- We're pals, right?
- Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, let me tell you something that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
- Really?
- Yes.
So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you.
And so will I.
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.
It's not funny, Ed.
Hey, shut up!
Will you knock it off?
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.
No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, I hate dangling.
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
Man, I hate lions.
- So pushy.
- And hairy.
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...
Ugly!
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.
We were afraid it was somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
- Yeah.
- I see.
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.
I just hear that name and I shudder.
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!
It tingles me.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, did you bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Did ya, did ya, did ya?
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
Kill Mufasa?
Precisely.

You wait here. Your father has a marvellous surprise for you.
What is it?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it?
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of father-son thing.
Well, I'd better go get him.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
No. Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Lucky daddy was there to save you, eh?
Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours?
Oh. Okay.
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.
Shut up.
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.
Stay put.
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is. Let's go.
"Little roar." Puh!
Rarr!
Rrrarr!
Rarr!
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.
Stampede in the gorge.
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?
Zazu, help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There on that tree!
Hold on, Simba!
Dad!
Oh, Scar, this is awful!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.
Dad!
Scar!
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!
Long live the king.
No!
Dad!
Dad?
Dad, come on.
You got to get up.
Dad?
We got to go home.
Help!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.
Simba. What have you done?
There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me.
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course. Of course you didn't.
No one ever means for these things to happen.
But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.
Oh, what will your mother think?
What am I going to do?
Run away, Simba.
Run. Run away and never return.
Kill him.
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.
So go get him.
There ain't no way I'm going in there.
What, you want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt?
But we got to finish the job.
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! You hear that?
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live...
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.
So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future.
Yaaaah!
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.
I think it's still alive.
Eeeuw.
All righty, what have we got here?
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.
So we're keeping him?
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?
My point exactly.
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here and find some shade.
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.
You nearly died.
I saved you.
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee, he looks blue.
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eating you?
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.
The food chain!
So, where you from?
Who cares? I can't go back.
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon here says,
"You got to put your behind in your past."
No, no, no.
- I mean...
- Amateur.
Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
- Right.
- Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world.
Well, that's not what I was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me.

I would never have had to do this with Mufasa.
What? What did you say?
- Nothing.
- You know the law.
Never, ever mention that name in my presence. I am the king!
Yes, sire, you are the king.
I... I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches.
- Hey, boss.
- Oh, what is it this time?
- We got a bone to pick with you.
- I'll handle this.
Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah. It's dinner time and we ain't got no stinking entrées.
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.
- Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
- Oh...
- Eat Zazu.
- Oh, you wouldn't want me.
I'd be so tough and gamey and...
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.
I thought things were bad under Mufasa.
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...
I said... qué pasa?
Good. Now get out.
But we're still hungry.
Out!
- Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.
I ate like a pig.
Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Oh. Right.
- Timon?
- Yeah?
Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.
Oh? What are they?
They're fireflies.
Fireflies that got stuck up in that big bluish-black thing.
Oh, gee.
I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.
Come on. We told you ours. Please?
Well...
Somebody once told me that the great kings of the past are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?
Pfff!
- Who told you something like that?
- Yeah, yeah.
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb?
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.
Was it something I said?
Simba?
He's... He's alive? He's alive!
It is time.

And your mother, what will she think?
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.
King? Lady, have you got your lions crossed!
King?
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?
- Look, I'm still the same guy.

Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, right, Simba?
Maybe you'd better go.
It starts. You think you know a guy.
Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love 'em.

It's like you're back from the dead.

But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
Well, I just needed to get out on my own, live my own life.
And I did, and it's great.
We've really needed you at home.
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
- I can't go back.
- Why?
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.
- What?
- Hakuna matata.
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...
Simba... and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry?
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.
I left to find help, and I found you.
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through.
I would if you'd just tell me.
- Forget it!
- Fine!
She's wrong. I can't go back.
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.
You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!
But you're not.
And it's because of me.
It's my fault.
Come on, will you cut it out?
Can't cut it out.
It'll grow right back!

No.

Father?
Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could I?
You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than what you have become.
You must take your place in the circle of life.
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.
Remember who you are.
You are my son and the one true king.
Remember who you are.
No! Please, don't leave me!
Remember.

Change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
I know what I have to do, but going back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it for so long.
Jeez! What was that for?
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.
But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it.

He was, but now I can't find him.

Ho ho! You won't find him here!

I can't believe it. He's gone back!
Gone back? What do you mean?
Hey, what's goin' on here?
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.
- Who?
- Scar.
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!
Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king.
Oh.
Simba, wait up!
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?

Besides, this is my kingdom.
If I don't fight for it, who will?
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.
I see nothing funny about this.
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle for this?
Yes, Timon. This is my home.
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!
Well, Simba, if it's important to you, we're with you to the end.
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.
So what's your plan for getting past those guys?
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!
Come on, Timon. You guys have to create a diversion.
What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?
Luau!

- Yep, yep.
♪ You could be a big pig, too! Oi!
Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.
I'll look for Scar.
Sarabi!
Yes, Scar?
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing theirjob.
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.
No, you're just not looking hard enough.
It's over. There is nothing left.
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.
If you were half the king Mufasa was...
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!
Mufasa? No, you're dead.
Mufasa?
No. It's me.
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?
It doesn't matter. I'm home.
Simba?
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you alive.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Oh, Simba, you must understand.
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Oh, well, I would, naturally.
However, there is one little problem.
You see them?
They think I'm king.
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar.
Either step down or fight.
Oh, must this all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.
I've put it behind me.
But what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
So you haven't told them your little secret.
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.
I am.
It's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would be alive. It's your fault he's dead!
- Do you deny it?
- No.
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again, but this time daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now, this looks familiar.
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is just the way your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret.
I killed Mufasa.
No! Murderer!
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.
Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behold...
All right.
All right.
I did it.
So they can hear you.
I killed Mufasa!
Hee-yah!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.
Aagghh!
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!
Please, don't eat me.
Drop 'em!
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?
- He called him a pig.
- To me?
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr Pig!
Aaaaggghhh!
Take that, you stupid...
Take that and that!
Run, you yellow-belly!
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.
But Simba, I am family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault. It was their idea.
Why should I believe you?
Everything you ever told me was a lie.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.
No, Scar.
I'm not like you.
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?
Tell me. I mean, anything.
Run.
Run away, Scar, and never return.
Yes.
Of course.
As you wish, your Majesty!
My friends!
Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy.
Yeah. That's what I heard.
Ed?
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!
No, I didn't mean... No! No!
It is time.

Stop, you brat!
Let me go, Father!
This battle is the chance of a lifetime!
Crazy fool!
The chance to get killed!
Why do you want to be a gambler?
A farmer's place is in the fields.
A long life eating gruel - to hell with that!
I want good food and nice clothes.
I'm gonna live it up and die young!
Old man.
I'd like some water.
Why the hell didn't you stop him?
How could I?
Kids these days are all mad.
It's not just the kids.
Everyone wants easy money.
It's all thanks to gambling.
A roll of the dice and you're rich.
Can't tell whose money is whose anymore.
Have you heard the sake brewer's trading silk now?
Says he'll pay more than the silk merchant.
Yes, but... what difference does it make... with the town the way it is?
We don't even know when the next silk fair will open.
Hungry dogs come running when they smell blood.
Let 'em rip each other apart and dye the silk in their blood.
Then they can have their stinkin' fair!
SILK MERCHANT
Samurai, wanna make some dough as a bodyguard?
The going rate has hit the roof.
My commission's one ryo.
Which side will you take?
Seibei Manome runs a brothel.
All the women you want.
But he's going downhill.
I'd bet on Ushitora Shinden.
Look.
The inn at the corner.
That's his place.
Tell him Constable Hansuke sent you.
I'd take you myself, but I'm the law around here.
Don't forget, now.
I get one ryo.
Go ahead.
It's a public road.
Even dogs pass freely!
You won't get hired like that.
You gotta act big, show 'em who's boss.
They only look tough.
Chop off one of their arms and they'll behave.
Then you'll get hired.
Mind your own business, you bastard!
Come in.
RESTAURANT
- Sake?
- Food.
There's no business these days, so I don't have anything.
Even the rice is cold.
I don't mind.
Actually, old man -
I know.
You can't pay.
I'll bust some heads first.
No!
I've seen enough fighting!
The food's on me, but then get the hell out of town!
Thanks.
There he goes again!
The casket maker.
Only guy in town making any money.
Can't make coffins fast enough.
It's best not to have any gamblers at all.
One boss to a town we can tolerate, but two is a disaster.
Only the casket maker profits from that.
Knock it off, you bastard!
Gamblers are so cold-blooded and greedy, you wouldn't think they'd have paternal feelings.
But all this trouble started when Seibei decided to give all his territory to his son.
His right-hand man wouldn't stand for it.
Ushitora's his name, a real -
Strange name.
His ma began labor in the year of the cow, Ushi, but he bounced out in the new year of the tiger, Tora.
Talk about ringing in the New Year with a plague.
He left Seibei to start a rival gang, taking half of Seibei's men with him.
Only swords can settle things now.
They're both fuming, rounding up drifters and criminals for their gangs.
Instead of buying silk, they're buying thugs.
How's business, casket man?
How many coffins did you sell while I was away last night?
Two to your side.
What?
And four to the other side.
Not too bad.
Ushitora's brother, Inokichi.
A wild boar, befitting his name.
He's a half-wit, but dangerous when mad.
He's returned with three new recruits.
What a disgrace!
That's our constable.
He's supposed to arrest the riffraff, but just look at him.
He's not the only one, though.
Have a look.
An imposing fa鏰de, but the owner
Tazaemon is worthless.
He's our cowardly mayor, a silk merchant by trade.
He'd managed to survive by siding with Seibei, but when Ushitora rebelled...
Tokuemon, the sake brewer, sided with Ushitora.
Tokuemon says he's the new mayor, and he even started selling silk.
Tazaemon is finished.
He bangs his prayer drum all day, hoping for Seibei's victory.
Hear that?
Damn them all!
This town is doomed.
Now do you see?
You'll gain nothing by getting sucked into this evil.
Eat quickly and leave.
I've had enough rice.
Give me some sake.
I like it here.
I'll stay awhile.
Why?
Don't you get it yet?
Yes, I do.
That's why I'm staying.
Listen, old man.
I'll get paid for killing.
And this town is full of men who deserve to die.
Think about it.
Seibei, Ushitora, the gamblers and drifters - with them gone, the town could have a fresh start.
You're nuts!
Not if you had nine lives!
I won't do it alone.
How then?
Sake.
I'll think while I drink.
Everyone in this town is crazy!
But you're even crazier!
I want to talk to Seibei.
Who the hell are you?
Wanna hire me?
I'll be your bodyguard.
I'll show you what I'm worth.
The two-bit samurai again?
What do you want this time?
- You guys have such cute faces.
- What?
You talk tough but couldn't hurt a fly.
Adorable.
Don't take us for fools.
See this tattoo?
I wasn't in prison for nothing!
I'm a wanted fugitive.
They'll crucify me if I'm caught.
Same here.
They'll stick my head on a pike.
Not to brag, but I've committed every crime in the book.
So you won't mind if I kill you?
- What?
- Kill us if you can!
It'll hurt.
We're gamblers.
We ain't afraid of the sword.
There's no cure for fools.
What?
Casket maker. Two coffins.
No, better make that three.
All right, make me an offer.
What'll you pay me to finish them off?
How about three ryo?
I'm going to Ushitora.
I bet he'll pay more.
Four then!
Five!
Six!
Add a zero to the end.
Ten! I'll pay you ten!
Twenty!
Twenty-five!
Thirty!
All right!
Fifty!
Very well.
Twenty-five in advance, with room and board.
My men wish to welcome you.
But first, a drink.
We gotta talk.
Stupid wench has no manners.
You're mad to pay 25 in advance to a complete stranger.
What if he runs off in the night?
Leave it to me.
He won't have time.
I plan to attack today.
Ushitora's men must be terrified after he killed three of their gang.
We'll win for sure with him leading us.
I see.
But then we'll have to pay him 25 more.
What if we kill him afterwards?
We'd get the whole 50 back.
- That's going too far!
- Quiet!
If you can't even do that, forget about being the heir.
Honor means nothing to gamblers.
Your mother's right.
You can't build a fortune unless you're known as a killer and a thief.
You kill that two-bit samurai.
Treat him nice and he'll let down his guard. It'll be easy.
The men won't respect you unless you show you can kill.
But I killed one of Ushitora's men!
One man!
Don't flatter yourself!
Some son you are.
What are you so afraid of?
Whether you kill one or one hundred, you only hang once!
Twenty-five ryo exactly.
Master, let's drink and get acquainted.
My son, Yoichiro.
My wife, Orin.
My four strongest men:
Magotaro, Yahachi,
Matsukichi and Sukeju.
Where's Master Homma?
By the way, may I ask your name?
Me?
Sanjuro Kuwabatake...
But I'm almost 40.
You must be joking!
As names go, it's good enough.
I'm a complete stranger, anyway.
Master, why sit over there?
Come sit here.
Here will do.
He gets 50 ryo, and I only get two.
He's in a different class.
Someday I'll show you my true worth.
Maybe sooner than you think.
How about today?
We raid today at noon!
In plain daylight, boss?
We haven't won until we kill
Ushitora and Inokichi.
They could run away at night.
Don't be afraid!
With Homma and this master leading us, we're stronger than ever.
Twelve o'clock noon!
Hurry up!
What are you doing?
You're not gonna sneak away that easily! Get in there!
We paid a lot for you!
Get in!
Master, please come!
Master, please hurry!
Ushitora's men have come out!
All right, follow the master!
You wanna fight?
Do it yourself.
I'm not interested.
Sorry, missus, but I don't intend to be killed after your victory.
Here's your 25 ryo.
Son of a bitch!
Chickening out at the last minute!
Where's Homma?
Find him!
- He ran away in broad daylight.
Which one of you is Ushitora?
I am.
What do you want?
Seibei has offended me.
I've cut my ties with him.
That's all.
Why, you -
Watch out!
This fight's gonna be bad!
It's gonna be bad!
What're you waiting for?
You can't back down now!
All right!
An inspector from Edo is coming!
You got lucky this time, you swine.
You're the lucky one!
Your head is mine when he leaves!
All you fugitives hurry up and hide!
The same goes for all of you!
Tell everyone to open their doors!
All's quiet around here, got it?
Not even the dogs are fighting.
Open up!
Open shop!
Act as if everything's normal!
Got that?
Old man... that inspector's a nobody, but he sure has a swank palanquin.
What's so funny?
His men are drinking tea.
So?
Take a look.
Spiked tea.
Don't be so angry.
If I could've had them massacre each other, it would've spared me a big housecleaning.
Too bad they were interrupted.
- Get out!
You're out of your mind!
You think so?
It's obvious. You think they'll just overlook what you did?
Ushitora and Seibei won't stand quietly by.
Sure, they'll come talk to me eventually.
Question is, who'll show up with a pile of money first?
All they care about is winning, so they both want me.
Just wait and see.
Hey, is that your nitwit mayor?
Is that Tokuemon?
Now it makes sense.
No wonder the inspector has such a nice palanquin.
By the way,
I'd like a drink too.
You've got nerve!
You're stone broke!
You want something?
You're tough.
I like you.
Aren't you angry
I killed three of your men?
They were worthless.
I'm Ushitora's brother -
- Inokichi.
- You know me?
I hear you're strong.
Not that strong.
Master!
Don't be a stranger.
Have a drink with us.
Or are you still angry?
- I should ask that of you.
- Don't be mean.
You took my joking too seriously, silly man.
Come on, let's go.
No, you don't.
We were gonna have a drink.
Right? Start the sake flowing!
Make it your best.
It's on me.
Never!
My brother'd beat me to a pulp!
And I'd be kicked out of the house!
- Bitch!
- Yeah, what?
Hey, casket maker.
Drowning your sorrows?
The inspector's long visit must have killed your business.
You've stayed ten days already yourself.
Don't be like that.
Your shop has flourished because of me.
Shut up!
This isn't a brothel.
If you want a place to stay, go to Seibei's.
Bad idea.
Both sides are fighting for me.
I'll stay here and let them keep hoping.
Everyone but him out.
Come to my place. Now.
What's the rush?
The inspector's leaving tomorrow.
A magistrate was killed in a town 24 miles from here.
He doesn't seem too concerned.
He won't learn of it until tonight.
You seem to know everything.
Was the magistrate's murder your doing?
Possibly.
The inspector's presence is costing me a lot.
So are my hired men.
I see.
Speaking of which, here's 30 in advance.
Thirty more if we win.
Come right away.
I'd feel bad not giving Seibei a chance to better your offer.
Ready to exploit any weakness, aren't you?
Tough luck.
I'll decide my price after the inspector leaves.
Cheer up.
The inspector's leaving.
Really?
Fantastic!
What did Ushitora want?
Son of a bitch!
The slaughter's gonna start again?
Looks like it.
What's taking them so long?
It's about time one of them made me an offer.
Some samurai.
All you talk about is money.
This is dangerous and dirty work.
It's only worth it if the price is right.
You'd only be a bodyguard.
With some bodyguards, the employers have to watch their backs.
What's that fool up to?
He's been running back and forth all day.
Gonji, a bottle of sake.
Forget it. I'm not gonna let you celebrate the butchery!
I'm not! I'm miserable!
They're making peace.
They are?
And I bought a lot of lumber for coffins.
What do I do now?
I'm sorry for you guys, but now the town will quiet down.
You idiot!
Gamblers only make peace to prepare for a bigger fight.
They can't have the silk fair if they're fighting.
No silk fair means no gambling rooms and no income from their territory, so they make up for a while.
A truce is merely the seed for an even bloodier battle.
You got that?
There's nothing more dangerous.
Still, they were so determined to destroy each other.
How'd they manage to calm down?
I think Unosuke suggested it.
Unosuke?
Ushitora's youngest brother.
He returned last night from his travels.
Evil bastard came back, did he?
He looks as gentle as the zodiac Rabbit he's named after, but he's a wolf inside.
A whole year you've been gone.
Even the winds welcome you!
Want to see something interesting?
What's going on?
Same thing at your place?
Makin' fools of us!
They end their feud, then send us away with crumbs in our pockets!
Sons of bitches!
We'll show 'em!
Bastards!
What are they moaning about?
Ushitora made us risk our lives, and that was just yesterday!
Hachi, quiet!
I'll tell ya, Kuma,
I can't take it anymore!
Let's go report it to the law.
Then that Ushitora's gonna -
That hurt!
Get up!
Let's go!
Why'd you do that?
- Come on!
- No!
Ushitora's a real bastard.
Where the hell did you come from?
What'd he pay you to kill that magistrate? One ryo?
Don't we wish!
Just two silver pieces.
That's a raw deal.
But the information will come in handy.
You're a gold mine.
Now I can blackmail Ushitora, or even sell you to Seibei.
Get up.
Get up!
It's a bargain.
If you take them and report it,
Ushitora's done for.
But boss, what about our truce?
Your son and Unosuke are negotiating at the mayor's place now.
So what?
It'd be perfect if Ushitora got arrested during the talks.
Ready, ladies?
Haven't had a woman in a while, have you?
Take your pick and have fun.
It's dangerous around here.
Wait!
Take care of your purchase.
It would be a total loss if Ushitora got them back.
Lock them up in the storehouse.
Get me Ushitora.
Who the hell -
Get me Ushitora!
Boss!
What is it?
So it's you, is it?
I don't need a bodyguard at the moment.
Too bad you turned down my earlier offer.
Hachi talks too much.
If you're too cheap, you pay more in the long run.
Two silver pieces - what an insult.
He and Kuma got drunk and blurted out everything.
Those bastards!
Where the hell are they?
One of Seibei's men overheard them and captured them.
I followed. They're locked up in Seibei's storehouse.
Sons of bitches!
You don't get information like this for free.
Take as much as you want.
You're my bodyguard from now on.
This is enough for now.
I'll consider the bodyguard part.
Uno, you don't know him, do you?
This guy's tough as hell.
Ino! Uno! What are you doing?
Get in here now!
What is it?
Don't kill Yoichiro!
Get his sword and take him to Brother!
Get going!
Seibei!
We have Yoichiro!
Did you hear me?
Listen carefully, and don't try anything funny.
If you want him back, bring us Kuma and Hachi!
We'll trade!
Each side will send three unarmed men to the guard tower at 2:00 a.m.!
Got that?
- Pretty good.
- It'll get better. Just watch.
Don't forget to call the hour at 2:00!
Old man, give me something to eat.
Take what you want from the pot.
I won't get any business with all this trouble brewing.
You know, old man, this town is starting to boil again, just like this pot.
What have you done?
Did you write this new little drama?
Half of it.
Unosuke just rewrote the other half.
It's 2:00 a.m.!
Ready, Ushitora?
We're coming, Seibei!
I'll push them forward, and you let go of your rope.
Seibei!
That was a dirty trick.
We're even now.
If you love Yoichiro, shave your head and ask my brother to take over as heir.
Just as I thought!
Uno, look here!
Hey, Ushitora, you see this?
I'll be keeping her!
Ask the horny old sake brewer what he says to that!
That was amusing.
Mommy!
Where's my mommy?
I'll show you.
Don't you want to look?
I can't see her!
You will soon.
Mommy!
Kenbo!
Nui!
Hansuke, hurry up!
Mommy!
Coward! Why didn't you bite your tongue off and die?
You caused us so much trouble!
Ungrateful bastard!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Seibei!
You'll be hearing from me!
I can't wait!
I've got a few things planned myself!
Don't come any closer.
He cried himself to sleep.
Poor fellow.
His wife was too beautiful.
It all started when he lost to Ushitora at gambling.
If she were ugly, he'd only have lost his house.
But old Tokuemon was drooling all over her.
Ushitora saw a chance to draw Tokuemon to his side.
He took the wife and house and dangled them in front of Tokuemon.
This poor fool built a hut right next to his former house just so he could watch helplessly as Tokuemon ravishes his wife every day.
I don't want her anymore!
I gave her up for good!
Then why the heartbroken look?
Going home?
Won't you get beaten up?
Weren't you told not to see her?
I'm used to it.
I don't mind.
Ushitora has his men watching over her.
She can't even see her son.
Good-bye.
Guys like that make me sick!
I've decided to be your bodyguard.
You have my gratitude.
I want 30 in advance.
That's a steep price.
I'd refuse if I were you.
But he's so tough!
Tougher than this?
Don't say that, Uno.
If I refuse, he'll go to Seibei.
That would be bad!
Buy him then.
Here. Thirty ryo.
Thirty more when we win.
Of course.
You have my word.
If that's settled, let's drink to it.
To our partnership!
Fine, but is the woman safe?
What woman?
Tokuemon's woman.
If they get her again, you'll lose for sure.
Don't worry.
I've got six roughnecks on watch.
That's not enough.
You need at least one as tough as this guy.
Brother, should I go?
I'll go along and see how they're doing.
Thanks.
It ain't a fun job.
You gotta stand in the cold when Tokuemon comes around.
He doesn't seem to be here now.
Is that where the jackass who lost his wife lives?
I almost forgot!
I gotta beat him up!
Hey, you!
Hanging around
Tokuemon's woman, huh?
How many times we gotta tell you not to see her?
Ino, there's trouble!
Everyone's dead!
All six men have been killed!
Tell Ushitora, quick!
Who's there?
Get your husband and run!
Idiot!
Mommy!
Nui!
Run for it!
Here's 30 ryo.
I stole it from Ushitora.
Take it.
You idiots!
What are you waiting for?
Stop that!
I hate pathetic weaklings!
Start crying and I'll kill you!
Ushitora's coming!
Get lost!
We'll thank you later.
Idiot! Don't ever come back here!
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What happened?
- Take a look.
What a mess.
Didn't I tell you?
Six men weren't enough.
Must have been
15 or 16 men.
Where's the wench?
Gone, of course.
Seibei's pretty clever.
Brother!
Son of a bitch!
My silk's burning!
Please put out the fire!
I'll give you anything!
Don't move!
Hand over the wench and we'll save the shop!
What wench?
Don't play dumb!
Give her back or else!
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up!
My sake's pouring out!
Do something!
Stop up the holes!
I'll give you anything!
Help!
This is Seibei's doing!
Come with me, men!
What happened?
Why so glum?
Your business should be booming.
No.
When the fighting gets this bad, they don't bother with coffins.
Another bottle.
Comin' right up.
You're unusually friendly today.
What's going on?
Gives me the creeps.
Aren't you angry that I became
Ushitora's bodyguard?
Not at all.
You're not a bad guy after all.
What?
You're not really bad.
You just pretend to be.
He came by last night.
Who?
The man who makes you sick.
He told me everything.
Oh, and another thing.
He said to give you this.
Aren't you going to read it?
Sure, it's just a long, tedious thank-you note.
But read it.
He risked his life to bring it.
Shut up!
I'm busy drinking!
We need to talk.
About what?
Ino just got back from a recruiting expedition.
- Get any men?
- No.
No wonder.
None of your former hires are exactly singing your praises.
But Ino heard an interesting story from one man.
He saw Tokuemon's woman crossing the ridge with her husband and little brat.
That was the morning after our six men were killed.
Which means that
Seibei didn't kidnap her.
It would seem that way.
Then who killed our men?
Ino, before you came running to tell Brother, did you see those men dead with your own eyes?
No. He told me -
By the way, those six were sliced up real good.
You're the only one around here that skilled with a sword.
So?
It occurred to me... that maybe you killed them.
But Uno, he's our bodyguard.
Why would he do that?
That's what I don't get either.
Hold it.
What's this?
"To the honorable samurai from Kohei and Nui."
You sure it's okay to leave him untied?
Sure. He's nothing without his sword.
Where am I?
This is the brewery.
This is the gate to hell.
Watch it!
A pat from you is like a beating from a normal man.
You want another thrashing?
Where are you going?
That's the shortcut to hell.
You're not supposed to kill him.
Don't worry.
He's still groaning.
Do you know who I am?
Then listen.
Master Tokuemon wants to talk to you personally.
You must know where the woman is.
You can't trust him.
He's out to save his own skin.
The master's talking.
You keep quiet.
I dislike long-winded talk.
The quicker we settle this, the better.
Tell me where the woman is.
In return, I'll let you live.
What's the matter?
It's a generous offer.
You're not going to refuse, are you?
I won't talk!
What?
- Wait! Don't kill him!
- Don't worry.
Kannuki, teach him a lesson.
How about it?
You gonna talk?
Hell no, you half-wit!
Don't kill him.
Don't get blood on that storage chest.
Thanks to him, we have to sleep here now.
I'm gonna beat him up again.
He's getting on my nerves.
Huh? I could've sworn
I locked this door.
The bastard's gone.
What?
Don't scare me like that!
Brother, this isn't funny!
Morons!
No point looking where it's light!
Search where it's dark!
Old man, open up!
It's me.
I know I'm quite a sight, but could you do your staring later?
Didn't I warn you?
You're too damn reckless.
Save your lecture!
They'll be here soon!
Tell them I went to Seibei's place.
Got that?
Did that two-bit samurai come here?
Lie and you'll be sorry!
Yes, but he went to Seibei's place.
Don't believe the old fool.
He and Two-Bit are in cahoots.
But Seibei would gladly hide him to find out where the slut is.
That guy's really something.
He wouldn't stay put with his head cut off.
Fine. We'll kill
Seibei's entire gang.
I only held back because of the woman.
Gather some straw and smoke them out.
Smoke 'em out like raccoons and kill 'em? Fun!
Pull yourself together.
But what'll you do now?
Go next door and buy a coffin.
How can you give up like that?
You idiot!
I'm not dying yet.
There's a bunch of guys
I have to kill first.
Is this safe?
What if Ushitora's men check?
They don't have time.
Take a look.
What's Ushitora doing?
Smoking out Seibei and his men.
Sounds interesting.
Set me down. I wanna watch.
That's crazy!
Set me down!
I can't see from here.
Move further out.
Uno, it's me! Don't shoot!
Idiot!
Don't leave your post!
Kannuki's guarding the back.
Listen, I killed those two guys who killed three of ours.
You came out to tell me that?
Get back in there!
You won't get away, you wench!
Come here, you greedy bitch!
Where are Seibei and Yoichiro?
- I don't know!
- Tell us or we'll kill you!
Mommy!
Seibei, come out!
Yoichiro's begging for mercy!
Seibei!
You win! I'm coming out!
Don't kill me or my son!
All right!
All my territory is yours!
You can take over!
You filthy scum!
Only the samurai is left.
Where is he?
- There's nobody in there.
- That can't be.
- See for yourself.
- He can't just vanish.
He's all beaten up.
He can't go far.
Old man, let's get going.
Son of a bitch!
The casket maker ran away!
That's not good.
Anyone else around?
It gets worse.
Inokichi's coming this way!
We have no choice.
Talk him into helping you.
- But -
- Just try it!
- Just in case.
- Thanks.
Hey, whaddaya doin'?
The casket maker and I were gonna bury this body, but the bastard got scared and ran off.
Would you give me a hand?
Are you kidding?
Hell, no!
- Afraid of a dead man?
- What did you say?
You talk big, but fear's written all over your face.
What?
I'm not afraid of nothin'!
Then hurry up and help.
Couldn't be easier.
You sure? We're going to the cemetery.
I saw ghosts there a while back.
Ghosts?
Hell, I see ghosts and I feel relieved!
Good. Let's go then.
- Is this far enough?
- Yes, thanks.
Where are the ghosts?
They only appear to scaredy-cats like me, not to brave guys like you.
I'd feel bad leaving you here alone.
I'll help you bury him.
That's all right.
Weren't you looking for someone?
You're right!
Brother's gonna beat me!
Are you all right?
That was all very amusing.
Can you walk?
There's a small temple nearby.
I can walk.
You don't look like one of the living.
I'll come back to life with a few days' sleep.
It's even worse when you smile.
You're late, old man.
I'm hungry.
It's me!
Gonji's in trouble!
What happened?
He got caught on the way here.
The rice and ointment for you gave him away.
Where'd they take him?
Seibei's place.
Ushitora has moved in there.
You plan to fight with that?
- I'll make sashimi outta them!
- Wait.
Use this. Being a coffin maker has its advantages.
It's wrong to use a dead man's sword, but it's the best I had.
Get away while he's fighting
Ushitora and his men.
You told him I got caught?
You stupid meddler!
Hurry!
Don't come any closer!
Mommy!
Children shouldn't play with swords.
Go home to your mother and live a long life eating gruel.
You're a nice guy.
I've got a favor to ask.
What?
Without my pistol...
I feel sort of naked.
I can't go to the other world without it.
Please... let me hold it.
Don't worry.
I fired it twice.
There's no more bullets.
Thanks.
I can't.
Everything's going dark.
Damn it!
Who's banging the prayer drum?
I don't need any prayers.
Hey!
Two-Bit! Are you there?
I'm here.
I'll be waiting for you... at the gates of hell.
Look at him.
He died as recklessly as he lived.
Hansuke!
What is it?
Go hang yourself.
It'll be quiet in this town now.
Old man.
See ya around.

Where is he? Where is he hiding?
I don't know. I've been looking for him since yesterday.
Aah! Oh.
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is he?
I don't know.
What are you gonna do to him?
You stay here in case that rat shows up.
Okay.
Who you protecting, you dumb asshole?
A stoolie who rats on his own friends?
They were your friends too.
I got it. You wanna end up like that bitch, huh?
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theater.
You stay here with this barrel of shit.
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.
Uh--
Easy, easy....
This way. Hurry!
There down. Mott Street.
Go. Go. Go.
Noodles.
Noodles.
Noodles.
Untie me.
Stay that way. No, stay.
I want them to know I did it.
Where you going?
I'm gonna go get Eve.
Don't.
Why?
They-- They already been there.
Do you need anything?
Money?
I got more than I need.
-Yeah, it's all yours now.
Where to?
Sir, where do you want to go?
Anywhere. First bus.
Buffalo?
One way.
That'll be $1.20.
I wanna rent a car.
Would you fill this out, please?
Go, go.
Go ahead, shoot the dice, man.
Shoot the dice. Shoot the dice.
Shoot the dice.
That's right. That's right, man.
That's right.
Noodles.
I brought back the key to your clock.
Lock the door.
When did you get back?
-Today.
-Why?
-They got in touch with me.
-Who?
I thought you might know.
Me?
I don't know nothing about nobody no more.
You gonna offer me a drink?
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.
Please sit down.
Who's Robert Williams?
I am.
"We wish to inform you that following the sale of the Beth Israel Cemetery...."
Yeah, the synagogue sent these out if you wanted to relocate your loved ones.
I got the same letter on account of my father.
Only the synagogue didn't send that.
I got that last week.
The rabbi told me he sent those out about eight months ago.
Yeah, that's right.
That's just about when I got mine.
So, what else did he say, the rabbi?
He said that I was lucky.
The bodies of Philip Stein...
...Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.
And they were up in a very fancy cemetery in Riverdale.
What's this all mean?
It means...
..."Noodles, though you've been hiding in the asshole of the world, we found you.
We know where you are."
It means...
..."Get ready."
For what?
That's the one thing it didn't say.
What do you think?
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.
Hm.
I moved everything in here.
I had to sell the house, the backroom.
You know, I always thought you might have helped yourself to that million bucks.
But now I know.
No.
You're on your ass worse than ever.
But I thought it was you who--
No, you thought wrong.
The suitcase was empty.
Then who took it?
That's what I've been asking myself for 35 years.
If it bothers you, I can sleep here.
-You can have my room.
-No. It's okay.
-How's your sister?
-I ain't seen her for years.
She's a big star now.
We should have known, huh?
You can always tell the winners at the starting gate.
You can always tell the winners, and you can tell the losers.
Who would've put a penny on you?
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.
Yeah, and you would've lost.
Well, you're beat. Good night.
Good night, Moe. Thanks.
What have you been doing all these years?
Been going to bed early.
Deborah, Papa says you should help.
No.
We've got customers all over.
We can't do everything.
Try. I've got my elocution lessons.
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.
Sorry.
Sorry, I can't make it today.
See you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Sorry, Fats.
Noodles!
Bugsy's got a job for us.
Hurry up. He don't wait.
Who you calling a cockroach?
So, what are you?
You're filthy, you make me sick.
You crawl up toilet walls just like a roach. So, what are you?
Let go!
I make you sick, huh? Then how come you showed me your tush?
Hm. To a roach.
Go look at yourself, David Aaronson.
She don't leave me alone, I'm gonna give her what she's asking for.
-What's Bugsy want?
-We gotta wake up a deadbeat.
That schmuck at the newsstand didn't pay.
Here's your money, sir.
It's beautiful.
Ha-ha-ha.
-Look at it, it looks great! Wow!
Come on, guys.
Come on, come on.
Now make up your mind.
-Noodles, let's take the dollar.
-Yeah.
Skip, here you go.
That one.
Him.
Hey, Sam, I'll see you next Thursday.
That one.
Hey, and bring your wife along.
Are you nuts?
Bugsy said we could take the dollar or we could roll the drunk.
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.
We'll wait.
-Well, you roll that one over there.
-What's to roll? He drunk it all.
Bounce that little shikker.
Jacket.
It's Fartface.
Shit!
We should've took the dollar.
Could've had 10 hot corned-beef sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.
Look, the wagon will hide us from Fartface. Get ready!
Now! Throw your jacket over him.
Hey, mister, you sick? Aw, poor guy, you'll be okay. Come on, I'll help you.
Come on, up you go.
Now, you're worse than my Uncle Nathan.
Why do you want to get soused?
You can't even walk. I'll take you home.
Go, Mama.
Stop right there. Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
What the hell are you kids doing here?
-What are we kids doing here?
-We're getting it up the ass.
Yeah, getting screwed.
Is there a law against it?
Can you spare a dime for pisherkehs that just got it up the ass?
Come on, get out of here.
Come on, get off the street.
Go on, get out of here.
Get off the street.
Go ahead. And don't come back.
I don't want to ever see you here again.
All right?
Hey, stop by for you later.
Yeah, but knock here on the john first.
My old man's praying, and my old lady's crying. And the light's turned off.
What the hell should I go home for?
At least in here I can read.
Where are you going?
Mama, don't get worked up.
You got pots to clean.
Peggeleh?
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.
Hi, Peggy.
At least you could lock the door.
Don't you like it?
I've seen better.
-You seen lots?
-How many you seen?
I'll tell you how many. None.
Let me see yours.
Looksies, no feelsies.
Peggy. Peggy, I-- I-- I--
I want--
-You like it, don't you?
-Not for free, I don't.
You bring me a charlotte russe with whipped cream, then you can do anything you like.
Tomorrow. I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Look, I don't give credit.
I promise. I promise.
You better stop squeezing me, or I'm gonna poop in my pants.
Well, are you getting out?
Come on, come on.
Give me six copies.
Drop your pants and I'll stick it to you again.
-What do you mean, "again"?
-That's a long story.
And look what time it is.
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.
Hold it a minute.
Now it's 6:35.
And I ain't got a damn thing to do.
Just you wait, asshole.
I'll do something with your time.
Wait! Hey!
Since we're talking about time...
...it looks like you're gonna break that lamp at 6:36.
-Where'd you pinch this?
-It's mine.
-Prove it.
-I gave it to him.
Oh, yeah?
Who the hell are you?
-Where you from?
-The Bronx.
And you give away watches?
He's my uncle.
-And who gave it to you?
-My Uncle Nathan.
My little brother.
Tell your uncle to stop by the precinct.
He's dead.
-Alcoholic.
In Kishnev, Poland.
Hm.
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.
-Requi-- What's that mean?
-Pinched, by him. At 6:37.
Just remember,
I got my eye on you two.
I got my eye on you too.
Take it! Take it!
Take the lamp off. I can't hold it.
Max.
Who's this?
My uncle.
-That one. With the cream.
-The 5-cent one?
Yeah.
For the twopenny one she only gives you a hand job. I can do that myself.
Not that one!
That one.
You sure?
Wrap it up pretty.
Good morning. Peggy home?
She's taking a bath.
That's great.
Would you tell her I'm here?
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.
Wait.
What do you want?
-Me?
-Mama said you were looking for me.
-Oh, ye-- No. The guys told me that--
-What?
-I'll come back some other time.
Noodles!
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!
What?
Did you get it?
His asshole blinked, but we got him.
Nice going, Fartface. And on duty too.
Heh. Uh, ha, ha. You boys caught me with my pants down that time. Heh, heh.
No, we caught you with your schmuck up the tuchus of a minor.
-Scram. Put this someplace safe.
That's all right. Ha, ha. Hey, hold it!
Where you going?
Stop! Hold it! Wait a minute!
Hey, you, stop! Hold it.
-What are you gonna do with that plate?
-Depends. What time is it, Max?
I think it's time we got our watch back.
-Okay, boys, we're even.
-The hell we are.
You'll be collecting your pension before we're even.
Hiya, fellas.
What do you boys want?
First off...
-...you're paying Peggy for us.
Ha, ha.
Okay. That's it?
Go ahead while I tell him.
Ha-ha-ha. I can't believe it.
My first time, and a lousy cop's paying for it.
Look, what else do you kids want for that plate? Huh?
Noodles was telling me about a guy called Bugsy.
Seems he's boss of this neighborhood, thanks to you.
-Meaning what?
-Meaning he pays you off.
Will you slow down?
What is your hurry? Take it easy.
If you keep this up, you're gonna come too fast.
Do you see what I mean?
You're so stupid. I can't believe it.
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?
-I close an eye once in a while.
-Well, now you close an eye for us.
Why? What are you kids up to?
He'll tell you.
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy, we're working together.
Bugsy'll flatten you.
Besides, I don't put up with no trouble on my beat.
You'll put up, and you'll shut up.
You hear nothing, and you see nothing.
Just like you did for Bugsy.
Shit!
Aw, don't get upset. That makes it worse.
It can happen the first time.
-It's them two talking out there.
-Can't you see you're ruining the mood?
We made our deal.
-So take a walk.
Come here, honey.
-Feel good, bubeleh?
-Ha! He'll never get it up.
Relax. Okay. Calm down, calm down.
Okay. Okay, come here.
I'm glad the baby's better.
Happy Pesach, Deborah.
Happy Pesach, Becky.
Hurry. We're gonna be late.
-Oh, there's Deborah.
-Sorry I'm late. Mama needed help.
Good girl. I just locked up, and I'm giving you the keys.
I thought I'd just practice my dance routines. That's all. All right?
Debbeleh, make sure you don't let the goyim in.
-Okay, bye.
-See you later, Debbie. Bye.
Get down off of there, roach.
That record's just like Ex-Lax.
Every time I put it on, you have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
-Give me a drink.
-We're closed.
Nice people don't drink on Pesach.
They go to the synagogue.
So, what are you doing here?
Somebody's gotta keep an eye on the place.
There are a lot of little thieves out there.
One of them could get into your house.
Especially if you leave the door open.
You can pray here too.
Here or in the synagogue, to God it's the same difference.
Come over here and sit down.
"My beloved is white and ruddy.
His skin is as the most fine gold.
His cheeks are as a bed of spices."
Even though he hasn't washed since last December.
"His eyes are as the eyes of doves.
His body is as bright ivory.
His legs are as pillars of marble."
In pants so dirty they stand by themselves.
"He is altogether lovable."
But he'll always be a two-bit punk...
...so he'll never be my beloved.
What a shame.
Somebody's there.
There ain't nobody.
It's Max.
Ah. So that's who it was.
Noodles!
Go on, run.
Your mother's calling you.
Noodles!
Just gonna go see what he wants.
Hey.
-Yo.
-You been here long?
-No.
Were you in there?
You're one lousy kisser.
I seen you go in there after that ball-buster.
Here's the stuff from last night. We got
4 for the silverware, 6 for the typewriter.
Shitsy Lipschitz wouldn't cough up any more. We gotta get somebody else.
I came to divvy up.
-Tomorrow, with the others.
-I also came to pick you up.
-I can't come right now.
-The houses, the stores are all empty.
We got our pick. You pick that.
Yeah.
Some partner I got. Have fun.
How's it going, boys?
Who's that?
Bugsy.
I hear you guys are in business for yourselves now, huh?
I hear youse are doing real good.
Ain't you gonna introduce me to your friend here?
I'll introduce myself.
Excuse the glove.
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
That's my cut.
You don't work for me, you don't work for no one.
-I don't like bosses.
Ha, ha.
You was better off you stayed in the Bronx.
It would have been better for you too.
-I'm gonna kill him one of these days.
-Yeah?
Meantime it looks like he's killed us.
Deborah, open up the door.
Deborah, open up the door.
Deborah.
That stuff, is it ready for the club?
-We're loading it.
Eh. Che cazzo succede down here?
-Al, we got the big boys with us today.
-They wanna work for us.
-Doing what Bugsy did. We want his job.
Do you get that? Ha, ha.
We the best escorts you ever gonna get.
A fangulo a ma, escort your mother's ass out of here.
Okay. Let's go, Noodles. We'll peddle your invention somewhere else, huh?
Hey, wait a minute.
What invention?
-You ship your stuff by the river, right?
-Sometimes.
And when you get caught by the Coast
Guard, you throw all the cases overboard.
-You lose the whole shipment.
So?
For 10 percent, we'll save it all for you.
-What do you got, a submarine?
-We got salt.
You got what?
-Salt. Me and the boys are rolling salts.
-Yeah. We need 3 tons of salt per shipment.
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to school where you belong.
What is it with all this salt?
Hey, hey, we got salt on our noodles.
Show them.
This is full of salt.
All right, come here.
So?
-Keep your shirt on.
We gotta wait for the salt to dissolve.
-Well?
-Hey, what's wrong?
Hey, look.
Hey. Wow!
Great!
-Look at that!
-It's great.
-Noodles.
-Look at it.
I see them! What did I tell you?
-Yeah.
Yeah!
Hey, Noodles.
Hooray. Hooray for us!
We did it.
Come here, Max.
We did it.
No, Max, no!
Max.
Max.
Max!
Max!
What would you do without me?
There.
From here on, we establish the shared funds of the gang.
They belong to all of us together and to none of us alone.
And we solemnly swear to put in 50 percent of everything we make. Agreed?
Agreed.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Agreed.
I wanna take another peek.
Announcing the immediate departure...
...of the Lackawanna Railroad,
Hudson Valley Express, Poughkeepsie...
...Albany, Utica and Buffalo.
All aboard.
This goes to Fat Moe.
We don't tell him what it's for.
And he gives it back only when we're all together.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Agreed.
Bugsy's coming! Run!
Noodles.
I slipped.
Bastard!
-Aah!
Schmuck.
Wanna go in?
Yeah.
You a relative?
An uncle.
It's open.
"Erected to their everlasting memory by their friend and brother...
...David Aaronson, 1967."
Can I take that for you, sir?
Your limousine is waiting.
Maxie.
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.
You're looking a little better.
Come on. Better get you off the streets.
-Some limousine.
-Ha, ha. What are you talking, huh?
We own the company now. It's a good cover. You'd be surprised. It pays off too.
My mother wrote me you was in the body-snatching business.
By the way, I appreciate everything you did for my family.
Forget it. It's your dough.
It's all down in black and white in the company books.
You're the company. You and Patsy and
Cockeye. Gravediggers and equal partners.
Heh. Hey, enough of this, huh?
Business before pleasure.
We got a rush job. Here.
Come here. Look at this. Come here.
Sudden death. Fucking tragedy, huh?
-Twenty-six years old.
-Twenty-six?
- What a shame.
-Great stiff. She died of an overdose.
And I'm ready for another. Ha-ha-ha.
Come on, Noodles. Pump the life into her.
You didn't turn pansy in there, did you?
There you go.
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.
Ha, ha. Don't worry. A pansy he ain't.
Thanks.
You're welcome, Noodles.
Whoops. Uh, sorry.
Thanks. Good night.
Hey, you want a little pick-me-up?
Oh, no, thanks. I've had mine.
Did you give her your all?
What do you think?
Bet your life I did.
Wait till you see this place. Got the best....
It's over here.
-Where we going?
-To a place that never closes.
Whoops. Watch yourself.
How's he doing?
He's doing great.
What's this?
Our place.
We got the hottest spot in town.
Eh? This is the real Fat Moe's.
Get rid of that rag, will you?
-What do you think?
-It's beautiful.
-Eh? You like it?
-Beautiful. Beautiful.
Hey, give me that.
-Noodles. Look who's here.
Patsy, look.
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here! Come here!
Patsy.
Oh.
-You look fantastic.
-Wait a minute.
How you doing?
-Look how big you got.
-Me?
Noodles. Oh. Oh, God.
-Noodles!
Freight train, coming through.
Hey. Hey, come on.
Hey, let's have a toast, for chrissakes.
-You look like shit.
-What do you want? I just got out of prison.
-Nice guy.
-Hey. Hey, Noodles, get a load of this.
Look.
Hey, Scotch heating.
-Yeah, a buck a cup.
Whoo!
-A buck a cup?
-Yeah.
-How much it cost us?
-Costing us?
-Yeah.
-A dime, including overhead.
-Hey, Noodles. Fat Moe.
Oh. Heh.
You look terrific.
-Look like you lost an ounce or two.
You think I would lose hemorrhoids.
Can't recognize him without an apron.
-L'chaim.
L'chaim.
Welcome home.
What the fuck kind of maître d' are you?
New guy rolls into the joint, you don't even show him around.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
-I didn't know. Eh, Noodles, I'm sorry.
You're some bunch of shtunks.
-You don't come up and get me?
He's the shtunk.
-Shtunk?
-Yeah, shtunk.
-He said you weren't out till Monday.
-You can get him the next time he gets out.
-Ha-ha-ha.
-God forbid. God forbid.
Whoa! Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.
Come on, let's see if you can guess who it is.
Mmm.
Charlotte russe. With a little too much whipped cream.
Peggy.
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.
Whoa!
My Peggy, she's worth every penny of it too, my red-hot mama.
Come on, come on. Eh, eh, eh.
You fuck.
Timber!
You've seen your old pals, now I want you to meet some new ones. Come on.
Peggeleh, I'll see you later.
You gonna lay here all night or what?
Cockeye wanted to play with the band.
I'm serious.
Come on.
-Aren't you going to say hello?
-Hello.
-Your brother's a real friend.
-He's a romantic.
-Max tell you I was getting out today?
-Max? No.
-You remembered yourself?
-No, Moe. It's always Moe.
Yeah.
You mean you weren't counting the days?
Of course I was. 4344, 4343.
I lost track at 3000.
-That wasn't my choice.
-Yes, it was. It still is.
Well, anyway, did you come here to welcome me back at least?
I still live here. I was on my way out.
Moe said I should at least say hello.
I hope Moe didn't have to bend your arm or anything like that.
No.
Welcome back, Noodles.
Hey, Noodles.
You dancing?
Every night at the Palace Theatre.
I've made some progress since I danced here among the brooms and the empties.
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.
Every night.
Noodles.
Go on, Noodles, your mother's calling you.
It's good to see you again, Noodles.
My pleasure.
-Did you get the wine?
-Dago Red. The best.
How you doing?
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It was a good movie.
-Hey, Max, how are you?
-Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
-This must be your friend Noodles.
-Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.
-Hi, Noodles, how are you?
-I'm all right.
It's very nice to meet you. But you don't have to call me Mr. Monaldi like he says.
I like my friends and people I respect to call me Frankie.
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.
Sit down, relax. You're home now.
This is my very dear friend Joe.
He came all the way from Detroit to ask me to do him a favor.
And I wanna do it for him.
I don't have to tell you who Joe is, how far he got, or how far he's gonna get.
He's not only my dear friend, he's my brother.
Frankie, I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.
I mean, the mustard doesn't even help.
These guys with you?
I told you these fellas are with me.
You could trust them.
You're in very good hands.
Just tell them exactly what you want them to do.
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.
Why us then?
If it's kid stuff, why don't you have the kids from Detroit do it?
Excuse me, Noodles. What he means is that it's something that's very simple...
...but for now, he needs kids from outside to handle it.
He just found out they're gonna move these diamonds to Holland in a few days.
So it's something came up right away.
You understand?
Hey, Joe.
Tell these guys the story about, um, the pussy being insured. What is it?
Tell these guys how you stumbled on this whole thing with the jewels....
Oh. Come on.
Tell them the story.
The pussy insurance. The insurance pussies. What is it? Tell them that story.
Life is stranger than shit, that's all. It's a pisser. No big story.
I got this insurance agent, this Jew kid named David.
This kid conned me into every policy in the world. Every policy, name it.
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.
I'm drinking with the boys one night, he comes in with his wife...
...a pretty brunette with a nice ass who works for a jeweler.
And he's still on the hustle, this guy.
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...
...the most serious policy that should be, you don't have me covered for."
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."
"You make me a policy that when it don't work, I get a payment...
...I'll write out a check now."
He thinks, he says, "Oh, I don't know if the actuality gauges govern this...
...but we can make a policy.
But you gotta guarantee you're in good health now."
"Oh, that's simple. Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.
If it stands up, then you know
I'm in good health to begin with."
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.
Not only that, she likes it. And she tells me, she blabs when her boss, the jeweler...
...is shipping stones to Holland...
...where he keeps his stash in a little drawer in the safe. Everything in the world.
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.
I never paid the first premium on the new cock policy.
Cock insurance.
Life is funnier than shit.
But...
...be easy with the girl.
I mean that. Be easy with the girl.
Oh, my God!
Open it!
Who's gotten in?
Had to go and be a hero, huh?
Open it.
-No.
Open it!
Don't-- No, don't hurt him!
-Don't hurt him!
Get this cunt out of here.
You animal! You asshole!
-Come on. Come on, hit me.
What do you mean?
-Hit me.
What, are you crazy?
-Straighten up and fly right.
-I'm all right.
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.
Come on, knock it off.
-I'm all right. Let go.
Come on, cut the act.
-Hit me!
She said hit her.
Go ahead, rap her in the mouth.
Hit me!
I'll hit you! You bitch!
You animal!
Put a cork in her.
No. Oh.
No.
No. Don't.
Don't. No!
No! You dirty bastards! You're--
Bastards!
Try the secret compartment.
Attaboy.
Thanks.
Wow. Nice matzo balls.
Huh?
Whoa.
Those are beautiful. Look at that. Hm?
Okay, better wrap them up.
We're going. You coming?
Coming.
-Morning.
-You get the stones?
Aw.... Pay him.
-Any problem?
-No trouble. Kid stuff.
You okay?
-How come you didn't tell me?
-Being inside can change you.
I'd already made the deal with Frankie to get rid of Joe.
With Frankie Monaldi, you don't say "yes," then "no." Couldn't...
-...take the chance you'd change your mind.
-You're right. I would have said no.
Frankie Monaldi is as big as they come.
He's got the combination in the palm of his hand.
If we're not careful, he'll have us in the palm of his hand.
You don't get nowhere alone.
I thought you were the guy that said you didn't like bosses.
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.
Let's just think about it.
They're gonna ask us to come in with them. There's a lot in it for us.
Today they ask us to get rid of Joe.
Tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you.
Is that okay with you?
Because it's not okay with me.
All right.
Let's just forget about it.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, let's go for a swim.
All right, what are you doing?
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.
-What are you doing?
Hey!
Are you crazy?
Shit.
That asshole!
I can't believe you did this!
District Attorney James Lister was killed in an explosion of a car...
...belonging to Secretary of Commerce
Christopher Bailey...
...as he was leaving the secretary's Long Island estate.
Mr. Lister, who was killed instantly in the blast, was scheduled to testify...
...in Washington on Thursday before a Senate committee.
A committee investigating what has come to be called the Bailey scandal.
A special team of detectives has been assigned to the case.
As for Secretary Bailey, he was not available for any statement at this time.
Did you know those guys?
--offices of his longtime legal advisor,
Irving Gold...
...in hopes of getting some comment.
Mr. Gold, you're aware that District Attorney Lister...
...is the second witness in the Bailey scandal to meet a sudden and violent end.
The first was Thomas Finney, undersecretary of commerce...
...who fell to his death from his 15th-floor office just a month ago.
Do you think there's a connection--?
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What the hell's keeping you here?
The only remaining witness is the man who...
...rightly or wrongly has given his name to this whole affair, Secretary Bailey.
-I'm curious.
What does the secretary think?
The secretary has no worries.
Sir, if he has no worries, why then has he retreated to his place on Long Island?
Far from retreating, he's busy preparing his attack on the questions...
...he will be asked by the committee.
I'd call them accusations more than questions, sir.
-The secretary has no worries.
But the public does.
Particularly in view of the rumors about rigged contracts, bribery...
...the international Mafia. Especially those dealing with the illegal use...
...of the Transport union pension funds.
Could you tell us anything about that?
Gentlemen, I deny all of these rumors and allegations against my organization.
Our hands have always been and will continue to remain clean.
In my entire life, I've fought to keep the American labor movement clear--
Him, I know.
--forced speculation, criminal elements...
...or corrupt politicians.
If any mistakes have been made--
He's still giving out the same old bullshit.
If any guilt at all exists in this situation, it lies elsewhere.
What's this I've been reading about you in the newspapers? Hm?
Inflammatory words from a union boss?
You still aren't gonna stop the workers or the social movement.
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!
We don't give a good fart about the socialist workers and their movements.
We just want you out of the factory so we can get the furnaces working again.
This is the last offer you're gonna get.
You want to sign it or what?
Tell your bosses they can wipe their ass with it.
Fill her up.
This is my last--
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.
It's me, Crowning.
-Crowning.
-Yeah.
That'll do, boys.
What'll do?
We almost got the kid where we want him.
And we got the boss where we want him.
Easy.
Easy.
Put them down.
Put your guns away, boys.
Just swapping prisoners.
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?
Union boy over here for Mr. Boss Man.
Well, look who's here. Ha, ha.
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.
Which reminds me.
How's that cancer in your gut coming along, Chicken Joe?
-Untie him.
-I don't take orders from you.
We're not asking you to take orders, Joe.
We're telling you.
Now go ahead, untie him.
Untie him.
Untie him.
Who are you?
Who's paying you?
I think this is really gonna piss you off there, Mac.
I think it's those dirty, dirty politician friends of yours.
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell him we don't want you in with us.
Our fight's got nothing to do with liquor and prostitution and dope.
You'd better get used to the idea, pal.
This country is still growing up.
Certain diseases it's better to have when you're still young.
You boys ain't a mild case of the measles. You're the plague.
And bastards like him are immune.
That's the difference between us and them!
Take it easy.
The difference is that they're always gonna win...
...and you're gonna keep getting it up the ass.
Sooner than you think.
Chief Aiello, moving policemen into the factory came as a surprise to everyone:
The press, the unions, especially the strikers.
Well, what did you want, sweetheart, a declaration of war?
Ours was a peaceable operation.
Wasn't that contrary to new union laws?
I'm chief of police, not chief of the people.
Was there any violence by the strikers to justify--?
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."
But you let scabs move in and start working.
Young lady, you wanna talk to me, call them "unemployed workers."
With your permission, I'll take these flowers to my missis before they wilt.
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy!
Chief, one more question.
We heard he's the youngest stockholder in that factory you occupied.
What'd you mean by that?
They say management expressed their thanks with a birthday present for the baby.
You know, slander is a serious offense.
Especially when it comes from a hack reporter.
You wanna find out how serious?
But since this is my first boy after four girls...
...I'll declare amnesty.
Ha-ha-ha. Behave yourself.
Go.
Thank you. Oh.
-He's eating?
-Mm-hm.
-For five.
-For five? Well, why not?
You could feed an army with these two milk plants. Ha-ha-ha.
We could open up a dairy.
Oh, hey.
Who loves you? Who loves you?
I love you.
And I love you.
And I love you.
Lucy!
-Don't you have to feed him at 6:00?
Uh-huh.
Come in.
-Oh, here he is now.
-That's my son.
That's my son. Oh, oh.
That's my son. That's my son!
Ha-ha-ha.
Jesus Christ, they change fast.
Yeah, but he looks like my old man.
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.
And look at that, the same devilish pride, huh?
Hey. Hey, hey.
Did you see his dickey?
-Vincent.
What?
-The girls.
-The girls!
Sooner or later you have to learn that after me, the boss in the house is him.
He's got balls just like his papa.
-Whoa! Hey!
-Let me have him.
No, no, no. I'll do this.
I'll do this, huh? Yeah.
Look. Hey, hey.
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha.
Let Papa change you, huh?
Come on, look.
Give me your little-bitty smile.
Come on, come on, come on.
What the fuck is this?
-What is this? Huh? What's that?
No! No! Oh, no!
-Look.
-It's the right number.
The right number?
I'll break your goddamn neck!
Find my son, or I'll burn down this goddamn building!
Hello! Hello.
-Would you shut up?
-Oh!
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.
Well, who's this?
Never mind--
To who am I talking?
Who the hell are you?
My son, where is he?
Where the hell do you think he is?
He's in the maternity ward. He never left.
He just got a little restless so he wanted to change his bed.
And the other kids got the same idea so they also wanted to change their beds.
So there you got 30, 40 screaming babies jumping from one bed to another...
...switching tags, so now we do have a real problem.
Piece of shit whoever you are!
What the fuck are you saying?
-Huh?
-...can't find my son!
Oh, no, no, no.
Luckily we were there to see that everything was under control.
If you want, we can put everything back where it was.
Except there's one problem.
-You gotta meet us halfway.
-Halfway. Tell me!
Why do you care who wins the strike?
That's got nothing to do with me!
What did I do?
What did you do?
First of all, you let the scabs in.
Second of all, you got the cops in there protecting them.
-That's my right. I'm a cop!
-All right, shut the fuck up.
Now, listen to me very carefully.
You're gonna call off your dogs and let the strikers work it out with the bosses.
I want my son back now.
Do that, we'll give you your kid's new number.
You don't do that, look for your kid yourself, and good luck.
-So, what is it gonna be?
-Okay.
-I'll call my men off today.
-Attaboy.
You know, Aiello, for a rotten, rat-bastard son of a bitch...
...you're not as stupid as I thought.
-We'll be in touch.
-When will you call?
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you.
-Bye.
-I gotta know--
-So?
-We got a deal.
-To a very smooth talker.
-Yeah.
-Mazel.
At least.
-Peggeleh.
-Noodles.
Where's that switch list?
The switch list?
-Yeah.
-I can't find it.
What?
I can't find it.
-What'd you do with it?
-I think I dumped it with that jacket.
What a yutz.
Oh, Pat.
Wait a minute, listen.
Listen, Noodles,
Noodles, wait. I remember.
The boys' numbers was odd-- Was even, and the girls' numbers was odd.
-That's very simple.
-You took good stock.
Hey, know what?
Let's give him an even number.
Uh, eight. Let's pick an eight.
Eight.
Yeah, it's a good number.
Wait a minute. What about the other little pischers?
We're better than fate.
We give some the good life, give it to others up the ass.
All right, boys, let's settle up.
It's Saturday.
Settle-shmettle, Peggy,
I'm gonna take mine out in trade.
Oh, you're such a nudge.
Hey, you know what?
I wish I was switched when I was a kid.
What makes you think you weren't?
I don't believe it.
Hey, you guys, come here.
Take a look at who's over here.
-That suit you, Peg?
Okay, fine, Max.
-What have you got?
-Over there.
Well, what--?
Holy shit! Noodles, Noodles!
Come here, come here.
Look.
The blond by the piano.
-Yeah, who's that? Yeah.
-Who's that?
You and this broad were practically engaged.
Ooh.
Beat me. Ooh, beat me. Ooh, I love it.
Ha, ha.
-Who was it? The Detroit cock-squasher?
Yeah.
Peggy.
Not her, she looks different.
You know that platinum blond in the flower dress? She's by the table.
See her? Call her in, will you?
-Carol.
-Carol, whatever.
Just tell her there's a bunch of her old friends here, you know what I mean?
Carol.
Carol!
Noodles, pfft, come here.
-Somebody here wants to see you.
-Who?
You know these guys?
No.
I don't think so.
No. Ha, ha.
No. I'd remember a bunch of good-lookers like these.
Oh, well, how could I forget?
There was, uh....
There was only one of you
I got to know personally, though.
Which one?
Let's see how good a memory you've got for faces.
You.
No.
Him.
We've been hanging out so long together, we're starting to look alike.
"Hanging out"?
Charmed.
You can call me Carol.
We've already met.
Pleasure.
The pleasure...
...is all mine.
Mmm.
So you left Detroit, huh?
No, her and her husband just come in on the weekends.
Yeah, it beats the seashore.
Well, she takes on maybe 10 guys and her hubby watches through the peephole.
Beats the hell out of the movies.
I wonder what that jerk is up to in his cubbyhole now.
He must be wondering, where is his fucking wife?
Why don't we make it a threesome, huh?
Can't you see he's got other plans for tonight?
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.
I'm not that kind of guy.
Besides, I'm afraid if I give you a good crack in the mouth, you'd probably like it.
Have a good night, fellas.
See you later.
-Been waiting long?
-All my life.
You wanted a place by the ocean so I had it opened. It was closed for the season.
All these tables are for two people.
Pick whatever one you want.
I like this one.
Here, sit down.
Oh, I'll have the asperges sauce vinaigrette and then a Châteaubriand.
I'll decide later.
-Monsieur?
-I'll have the same.
For the wine?
You decide.
I'll just have water.
-You decide.
-Thank you.
You've been around.
Where'd you learn all them
"parlez-vous français" dishes?
Who's teaching you that stuff?
You mean a sugar daddy who tries to teach me how to act?
I read books. I learn everything.
I want to know everything.
Doesn't it make sense to have plans?
Yeah, it does.
What about me? Am I in these plans?
Noodles....
You're the only person that I have ever--
Ever what? Go ahead.
Ever what?
That I ever cared about.
But you'd lock me up and you'd throw away the key, wouldn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah.
And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.
-So?
-So I got to get to where I'm going.
-And where's that?
-To the top.
Now you sound just like Maxie.
Youse are both alike, that's why you hate each other so much.
Do you want me to leave?
No, I don't want you to leave.
You dancing?
-You asking?
-I'm asking.
I'm dancing.
To keep from going crazy, you have to cut yourself off from the world.
Just not think about it.
You have to, uh....
You know, years that went by, it seemed like...
...no time at all, because you're not doing anything.
But there were two things I couldn't get out of my mind. One was Dominic.
The way he said "I slipped" just before he died.
The other was you.
How you used to read me your Song of Songs, remember?
How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter.
I used to read the Bible every night.
Every night I used to think about you.
Your navel is a bowl, well-rounded with no lack of wine.
Your belly, a heap of wheat surrounded with lilies.
Your breasts...
...clusters of grapes.
Your breath, sweet-scented as apples.
Nobody's gonna love you the way I loved you.
There were times I couldn't stand it anymore. I used to think about you.
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."
And that would get me through it all.
You know how important that was to me?
Noodles, I'm leaving tomorrow to go to Hollywood.
I wanted to see you tonight to tell you.
No.
No! I--
No! No. Ah!
No. Please, no. No, please. No!
No! Oh, no! No, please!
No, no! Please, no, no. No.
No!
Deborah. Deborah.
Get away! Get away!
I'll be right back.
Take her home.
Take her home.
All aboard!
Well...
...look who's back.
What's this?
It's a throne.
It was a gift to a pope.
-Cost me 800 bucks.
-It's from the 17th century.
So, what are you doing with it?
I'm sitting on it.
-You got any coffee around?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Hm.
While you were on vacation, we were working overtime.
The union paid off.
That's your share.
Yeah. Even that geek.
You know, Jimmy "Clean Hands"...
...respects us.
Eh, I shed a little blood for the cause.
Yeah, it's all in the papers.
Morning Telegraph, they didn't like it.
It says, "Underworld joins strikers in brutal battle."
But The Post, they liked it.
"Ends justify means in decisive gangland encounter."
And they're the ones that kvetched about the Atlantic City job.
Heh. Newspaper guys never know what the fuck they want.
-Well, you could have looked for me.
We did.
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.
So fucking doped up you didn't even recognize him.
Yeah, you were. Heh.
You called me "Deborah." Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.
We do our business together and fucking broads do not get in the way...
-...and you know it!
Yeah?
-Yeah.
-Then what's she doing here?
Today ain't Saturday. She should be in
Detroit, screwing on the assembly line.
Well, she's screwing here now.
And only with Max.
Oh, yeah?
-With her husband peeping through?
-No, I left him.
You live with her, bring her here, and you tell me not to mess with broads.
-You forget one thing.
What?
-I don't give a fuck about her.
-Max--
Shut up! Shut up! Shh!
Maxie, tell me something.
What'll you spend your honeymoon on?
-Maxie--
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!
Just shut up!
You want me to dump her?
You want me to kick her out of here?
Want me to kick her ass out or what?
You want me to kick--? Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Get out!
You gonna tell me I don't have a way with women? Ha-ha-ha.
-Hello.
This is Jimmy. Who's this, Max?
No, it's Noodles.
Okay, listen.
We're gonna need you guys today.
I'm gonna be making a tough speech, and I think you--
Go, go!
Start the engine.
I'll be right with you.
Mr. Gallagher wants you to know how much he appreciates what you did.
To show his appreciation....
Here's an envelope for the both of youse.
If we gotta complete the job,
I'll let you know.
Whoa! Whoa!
Wiped out by a blast of Cordon Rouge.
What would Crowning and his bosses say after that, eh?
Never be afraid of you, then, would they?
They're still not afraid of me.
It was you boys that scared them off.
And you didn't want these guys.
Aren't you lucky you got party leaders...
...like myself who care about the union?
Hey, the strike is settled. We won.
That's what counts. Am I right, Jim?
It was tough for Jimmy not to be there to sign the contract though, huh, Jim?
No.
What's tough is, you boys did more in a night than I could in two years of talking.
Forget it.
To the hottest newcomer...
-...in American unions.
There you go.
Jimmy Conway.
Now you're talking.
Roll out the barrel.
May God bless.
Drink up. Suck it right down.
You must be crazy giving him drinks. We're going to operate.
Oh, what's the rush? They already told me
I'd be a gimp for the rest of my life.
Don't worry, Jimmy, with one leg a little shy, you're gonna take giant steps.
Yeah. And always one step right behind you, Sharkey?
Make sure they work on the right leg, Jim.
-It's only blood, huh?
-Mazel.
You boys got yourself a real martyr for a friend. Make it work for you.
Yeah, but what the hell are we gonna do with a martyr?
Times change. Prohibition ain't gonna last much longer. Take it from me...
-...a lot of you guys will be out of work.
-Go on, Mr. Sharkey. We're interested.
You ever think of setting yourselves up in business?
All those trucks they're using to haul liquor, soon be selling them for nothing.
I'm talking about hundreds of vehicles controlled by a national organization...
...and supported by a powerful union headed by Jimmy Conway.
Whatever you ask, there's no way he can turn you down.
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.
Jimmy "Clean Hands" in business with us?
They won't be clean for long, with the hands he's gonna shake.
Everything in good time.
-We're not interested.
-What's the matter, you got a problem?
We got plenty of money tucked away.
Why not invest it? What is the problem?
I'll put the party behind you.
And I got friends in high places.
I'm not interested in your friends, and I don't trust politicians.
You still think like some schmuck from the streets.
If we'd listened to you, we'd still be rolling drunks.
-Are you broke?
-Don't bust my balls.
I am talking about real money.
This is real money to me. It's a lot of money. You want any of it?
-You carry that stink of the streets.
-I like the stink. It makes me feel good.
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.
And it gives me a hard-on.
You're carrying dead weight, Maxie.
One of these days, you're gonna have to dump it.
Maxie. Let me know when you're gonna dump me.
Meanwhile, I'll take a vacation in Florida.
I got a yen for the seashore.
Hey.
Listen, I was thinking it over and, um....
I guess I kind of got a yen for the seashore myself.
You wanna go swimming?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.
Read all about it! Read all about it!
Read all about it!
Hey, Maxie.
-Max.
-Huh?
How much money we got put away?
Why?
Because we're unemployed.
About a million bucks.
-Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
-In my underwear.
-I'd have found it there.
-Hey.
Huh?
We gotta reorganize, Max.
And I got a couple of good ideas.
Me too.
If I had a million bucks,
I'd take it easy.
We'll take it easy when we got 20.
-Fifty.
Where you gonna get that?
Right here.
What's that?
It's a dream.
A dream I've been dreaming all my life.
I swear to God, Noodles, you and me together, we can make it come true.
What is it?
The Federal Reserve Bank.
It's the biggest step we can take, Noodles.
You're really crazy.
Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't you ever say that to me again!
What chance is there that a crazy thing like this might succeed, hm?
Don't ask me, ask Max.
You know as well as I do that this is suicide, pure and simple, for everyone.
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell him.
You got your own methods.
Yeah, I tried.
He doesn't want to screw anymore.
All he thinks about is this job.
Tear gas, hostages, now he's gonna do this.
He's gonna do it with or without you.
Noodles, we've never liked each other.
We put up with each other for Max's sake.
So why don't we just get together once...
...and do something for him?
And after that...
...we can go back to being enemies.
You know, if you were all in jail first...
...there wouldn't be any bank job.
I got the idea from your friend Max.
What do you mean?
He laughs at you. He makes fun of you.
He says Eve has got you by the balls.
Every time you walk past this place, you shit in your pants.
You'd do anything for the cops to pick you up so you wouldn't have to do this job.
Is that true, huh?
Well, then do it.
Do it. Put him in jail.
Put him in jail. Not long.
Just long enough so he can get the idea out of his mind.
If you can't stand being away from him, put yourself there too.
Better off than being dead.
You know what to do.
And if you don't, I will.
Get out. Take a cab.
I'm busy. I got things to do. Get out.
Noodles?
Make up your mind fast, huh?
What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?
Why are you going out tonight?
Why bother now that prohibition is almost over?
Everybody's selling. We got friends who have a lot of booze they wanna get rid of...
...for practically nothing.
So we figure, why not?
I'm gonna be gone for a while.
I'll be waiting at the hotel.
I like it when you come home late and wake me up.
I'm not gonna be home tonight.
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow either.
I thought these things only take a couple of hours.
Ladies and gents, I drink to the demise of Fat Moe's speakeasy.
Who the hell wants to drink here legally anyway?
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.
Here's another one.
Ha-ha-ha.
Here's mud in your eye.
Boys.
Let's drink to our last shipment.
Because there's more onboard tonight than just booze.
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten years that were really worth living.
Yeah.
Aah.
Noodles.
Noodles.
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.
How long will I have to wait?
A year and a half, more or less.
Six months off for good behavior.
-What are you gonna do?
-Don't ask.
Operator.
Police, please.
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.
Hello.
Who's speaking? Can I help you?
-Hello?
-Yeah.
I got a good tip for you.
Yeah, who is it?
Yeah, it's Max. Open the door.
-What's the matter with you? You sick?
-No, I'm fine.
You don't look it.
Maybe you'd better stay home tonight, huh?
-Why?
-Heh.
You know, I've been watching you all night.
And you've been drinking like a fish.
Trying to get your courage up?
We're only bringing in a shipment of booze.
It's got so you're even scared to do that.
Maybe you just better stay home tonight.
With Eve. Heh-heh-heh.
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.
Maybe Sharkey was right.
Maybe I ought to just dump you.
You're really crazy.
Never say that!
Don't say it!
Max made fools of us, Noodles.
He wanted to die.
Did you know his old man died in the nut house?
Max didn't want to end up the same way.
So he put the idea in our heads to tip off the cops.
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first...
...just to get himself killed.
Uh, what is this?
Opening night.
Fifteen years ago.
Uh, who's this?
Patron saint of the place.
And some actress.
Do you know her?
No.
Hello, Deborah.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
What is someone supposed to say after...
...more than 30 years.
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good."
Or, "I was hoping I'd never see you again."
I never thought I would.
There's a difference.
Yeah. At least you recognize me, that's something.
Actresses have good memories.
You want a drink?
I'm having one.
Margo?
-Yes, miss?
That's all for now. You can go.
All right, miss.
She called you "miss."
You never got married?
No.
You live alone?
No.
Where were you?
I was out of town.
Have you been back long?
A couple of days.
Are you staying?
That depends.
Why do you want to see me?
Two reasons.
First, I wanted to see if you did the right thing...
...turning me down to become an actress.
Well?
You did. You're terrific.
"Age cannot wither her."
It's like the play was written for you.
What was the other reason?
The other reason...
...is to decide whether I should go to a party tomorrow night.
A party?
Yeah, on Long Island.
A Secretary Bailey.
Do you know Secretary Bailey?
No.
But I was invited anyway.
But if you don't know each other, why were you invited?
I don't know.
I thought you might know why.
Me?
Why me?
Because you know him.
-Who is it?
David.
-No, David.
Can I come in?
No, no, no. Just wait outside,
David, I'll call you.
Okay, I'll be right here.
-What does Secretary Bailey want from me?
-You came here to ask me that?
-Why did he send me an invitation?
-I don't know. I don't know.
Why should--? Why should I know about your invitations? I don't know anything. I--
What do you want from me? Why did you come here? I know nothing, nothing.
Now you're a lousy actress.
Who is Secretary Bailey?
Secretary Bailey is a rich businessman.
He came to the United States as a starving immigrant and made a lot of money...
...in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where he's lived for 30 years.
I know all that. It's all in the papers.
What else is there?
He married a very wealthy woman.
They had a child.
She died when the child was born.
A few years ago, he went into politics.
Moved here.
That's all past history. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about now.
Right now he's in trouble.
Why can't you just tell me you've been living with him all these years...
...and that you're his lover?
Age can wither me, Noodles.
We're both getting old.
All that we have left now are our memories.
If you go to that party on Saturday night, you won't have those anymore.
Tear up that invitation.
There's an exit back this way.
Noodles, go through it.
Keep walking.
Don't turn around.
Please, Noodles.
I'm begging you. Please.
Are you afraid that I'll turn into a pillar of salt?
If you go out that door, yes.
This is Secretary Bailey's son.
His name's David, just like yours.
Please go in.
What are you waiting for?
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.
Sit down, Noodles.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.
Well, I was curious.
So many important people in one place.
Yes. Well, the rats usually desert a sinking ship.
But in my case, they appear to be flocking onboard.
Yeah, well, I read about your troubles in the newspapers.
But a man in your position, with all your power and all your privileges...
...has to assume a certain amount of responsibility...
...a certain amount of risk.
Why'd you ask me to come here, Mr. Bailey?
That invitation doesn't mean a goddamn thing, and you know it.
All that counts is what was in that suitcase.
The money and the contract.
It didn't say who the contract was on, though.
Haven't you figured that out yet?
You, Mr. Bailey?
I haven't had a gun in my hand for many, many years.
My eyes aren't too good, even with my glasses. My hands shake.
-And I wouldn't wanna miss, Mr. Bailey.
-Cut the bullshit, Noodles.
I'm already a dead man.
At least give me the chance to settle the debt that I owe to you.
I'll never make it before the investigating committee.
They're scared to death
I'll implicate the whole bunch of them.
They gotta get rid of me.
Today is as good a day as any.
You do it, Noodles.
You're the only person
I can accept it from.
You see, I found out where you were.
I brought you back here for this.
To even the score between you and me.
You can get out through there.
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Bailey. You don't owe me a thing.
Your eyes were too full of tears to see it wasn't me burned up on that street.
It was somebody else.
You were too shocked to realize that the cops were in on it too.
That was a syndicate operation, Noodles.
You're crazy.
You said that to me once before, a long time ago.
But my mind was never as clear as it was at that moment.
I took away your whole life from you.
I've been living in your place.
I took everything.
I took your money.
I took your girl.
All I left for you was 35 years of grief over having killed me.
Now, why don't you shoot?
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.
Sometimes to defend myself, sometimes for money.
And many people used to come to us.
Business partners, rivals...
...lovers.
Some of the jobs we took and some we didn't.
Yours is one we would never touch,
Mr. Bailey.
Is this your way of getting revenge?
No.
It's just the way I see things.
It's 10:25...
...and I've got nothing left to lose.
When you've been betrayed by a friend, you hit back.
Do it.
You see, Mr. Secretary...
...I have a story also.
A little simpler than yours.
Many years ago I had a friend, a dear friend.
I turned him in to save his life...
...but he was killed.
But he wanted it that way.
It was a great friendship.
It went bad for him and it went bad for me too.
Good night, Mr. Bailey.
I hope the investigation turns out to be nothing.
It'd be a shame to see a lifetime of work go to waste.
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
Through the night
With a light from above
From the mountains
To the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God bless America
My home sweet home
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
In the last year of the World War, the Tomainian nation began to weaken.
Behind her lines revolution had broken out.
Her diplomats were frantically suing for peace...
while at the front
Tomainia's army fought on...
confident its war machine was invincible...
confident its war machine would smash the enemy's lines.
Big Bertha, a cannon that could hurl a projectile a hundred miles...
was this day to make its first appearance on the Western Front...
was this day to strike terror into the hearts of the enemy.
Seventy-five miles away was her target, the cathedral of Notre Dame.
Range: 95,452!
- Range: 95,452!
- Yes, sir!
- Stand clear!
- Fire!
Hey!
Stand by your trigger.
Yes, sir.
Range correction: 95,455!
- Range: 95,455!
- Yes, sir!
Breach secured!
Stand clear!
Ready! Fire!
Defective shell.
We'll examine it. Come on.
Come on.
- We'd better check the fuse.
- Yes, check the fuse.
Yes, sir. The fuse.
Look out! Come on! Run!
- What's that?
- An air raid!
- They're after Big Bertha!
- Right! To the antiaircraft gun!
- To the gun!
- Quick!
Hey! Have you gone crazy?
Come down out of there!
Get up there, will you!
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?
- Sorry, sir -
- Sir! Report from Captain Snout!
The enemy have broken through!
Every man to the front!
Muster the gun crew, quick!
You, report to Sergeant Bloom.
- Come on!
- Yes, sir!
Get your hand grenades there, soldiers.
Come on there.
Get your hand grenades.
Hey, soldier! Where's your hand grenade?
Hey, come here!
- Where's your hand grenade?
- Haven't got any, sir.
Give him a hand grenade.
Go on.
Keep moving. Come along.
Move forward.
Hurry it up.
Come along. Hurry up.
Pardon me, sir, but to work this -
How do you -
Pull the pin, count 10 and throw it.
Let 'em have it!
Hey, come on!
Hey, this is no time to scratch.
Here, pull yourself together.
Take this.
Forward!
Hey, you men! Fall in here!
Hey, you, come on!
Hurry it up there!
Order! Arms!
Prepare to attack!
Forward!
Captain!
Capitán!
There you are.
Oh, excuse me!
The enemy!
Come on, fellas! Let's get him!
Good afternoon, sir. May I come in?
- Who is it?
- Friend.
Come in.
- Sir.
- What division?
21 st Artillery, sir.
Take this. Hold 'em off.
And keep firing.
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Yes, sir.
Help! Comrade, help!
- What is it?
- I'm exhausted.
Quick! Help me to my plane!
Yes, sir.
- Thank you, my lad.
- Steady.
I'll see you get the Tomainian Cross for this.
That's all right, sir.
I'm only too willing to oblige.
Oh, you saved my life.
- Thank you.
- I'll strap you in.
I'm weak.
I can't make it alone.
- You'll have to stay with me.
- All right, sir.
- Can you fly a plane?
- I can try.
Quick! Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.
- Take charge of that gun, Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!
The enemy! They're coming!
Quick! Lift my hand to the throttle!
We'll fool 'em!
- Here. Hold on to these dispatches.
- Yes, sir.
If we can deliver them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win the day!
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh, don't say that.
I'm sorry, old man.
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.
Oh, wait - Please! Hey!
Hey, mister!
- Hey!
- Where am I?
- Don't you know me?
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Of course.
- Yes.
Yes, I - I feel better now.
- Ah.
- The blood's returning to my head.
What's below?
- Looks like the sun.
- The sun?
- Seems to be shining upwards.
- Strange.
- How's the gas?
- Terrible. It kept me awake all night.
No, no, no!
The gasoline in the tank!
Oh. Almost empty.
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?
Time?
About, approximately, one minute to 12:00.
Strange.
Look at that.
Seem to be defying the laws of gravity.
Water!
- Huh?
- Quick! I'm going to faint!
Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh -
You'll get - We'll get into trouble if you faint any more now.
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Now be careful.
- Here now. Just hold it.
- Quick.
Hold it. Hold it. I think I can - We'll just see -
Faint. Water.
- What on -
- Oh, water.
- Here, take it!
- Oh! Quick!
There's something wrong.
Oh, I can't reach it.
Oh, water! Faint!
Ah! Oh, it's all gone!
What's the matter?
- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.
I'm trying to.
We're upside down.
- I know it.
- Give me that stick!
Impossible.
Oh. There it goes.
We're out of gas.
Well, I suppose this is the end.
- Cigarette?
- Not now.
Then I shan't need this anymore.
What month is it?
April.
Spring in Tomainia.
Hilda will be in the garden now tending the daffodils.
How she loves daffodils.
She would never cut them for fear of hurting them.
It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil.
Sweet, gentle Hilda.
A beautiful soul.
And she loved animals.
And little children too.
We've landed! Dispatches!
Comrade, where are you?
Comrade!
Comrade, the dispatches!
Tell me, where are they?
- Are you hurt?
- Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!
- What's that?
- Hurry, man!
If I don't deliver these dispatches at once, we're defeated!
- Well, the war's over.
- What?
- We lost.
- Lost?
Hynkel Party Takes Power!
Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier, ex-barber, veteran of the World War...
suffered a loss of memory and remained an inmate of the soldier's hospital for many years.
He was ignorant of the profound change that had come over Tomainia.
Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation with an iron fist.
Under the new emblem of the Double Cross liberty was banished...
free speech was suppressed...
and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.
...und ze sauerkraut!
Baloney.
Baloney -
Adenoid Hynkel has just said...
yesterday Tomainia was down, but today she has risen.
Democratzy shtunk!
Democracy is fragrant.
Liberty shtunk!
Liberty is odious.
Free sprechen shtunk!
Freedom of speech is objectionable.
Tomainia has the greatest army in the world.
The greatest navy in the world.
But to remain great we must sacrifice.
We must tighten our belts.
Hail Hynkel!
Ah, Herring.
Poopschen Herring.
Bismarck Herring!
The Phooey now speaks to the Field Marshal Herring, the minister of war.
From the hearten...
Und Garbitsch. Herr Garbitsch.
He is now addressing
Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior.
Herr Garbitsch.
Herring shutten smelten fine from Garbitsch...
und Garbitsch shutten smelten fine from Herring.
Herring und Garbitsch.
His Excellency recalls the struggles of his early days...
shared by his two loyal comrades.
Ah, und the Aryan... und the Aryan maiden -
Ah, the Aryan maiden.
Ah, the delicatessen mit ze schoe...
und the flaxen mit ze stress.
Ach, und the Holstein...
mit the muss.
Ah, ze muss!
Und der kinder Katzenjammer.
The Katzenjammer mit the...
Hail Soldiers for Hynkel!
Zein the Aryan...
und now der Juden.
Der Juden!
...da sauerkraut mit the Juden.
Und da strangulation mit da...
Der Juden.
Ohh, der Juden.
His Excellency has just referred to the Jewish people.
Und now...
Europe...
Blitzkrieg French...
and final straff und en France...
and straff mit eine Finland!
Und mine straff mit Russia...
Tomainia!
In conclusion, the Phooey remarks...
that for the rest of the world he has nothing but peace in his heart.
We now pause for station identification.
This is the Peri-mutuel Network...
bringing you direct from Tomainia
Adenoid Hynkel's address...
to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross.
The English Interpreter is Heinrich Schtick,
Adenoid Hynkel's personal translator...
who is apparently reading from a prepared manuscript.
Stand by for further commentary.
Go ahead, Tomainia.
His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.
Ach! Ohh! Your Excellency!
Are you hurt?
Straff! Straff da fluten flavin da cheesen cracken!
Da fluten da banana!
Da banana!
- Da banana!
- Da bitte booben!
- Banana!
- Banana!
Dein big booben!
Cheesen crackers!
Banana.
Inside, da booben.
You ride in the other car.
Thank you, children.
His Excellency seems well pleased...
as he's greeted by a committee of Tomainian children and their mothers.
Now he pauses before a woman with a child.
Camera.
Even the baby is thrilled...
and seems all smiles at His Excellency's attention.
Hail Hynkel!
His Excellency leaves the scene of his triumph...
and will return to the palace along
Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture...
where he will pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces...
The Venus of Today and The Thinker of Tomorrow.
- How was it?
- The speech?
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.
Thought your reference to the Jews might have been a little more violent.
- What?
- You've got to rouse the people's anger.
At this time, violence against the Jews might take the public's mind off its stomach.
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.
Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately.
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.
What's good about it?
Well, conditions could be worse.
If you think they could be worse, you have a great imagination.
Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.
Well, you're better off than a lot of other people.
- What have you heard from the barber?
- Still in the hospital.
Aye. Ever since the war he's been there.
Yep.
Why don't you try and rent his barbershop for him?
He won't let me.
Every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
It seems a pity it should be idle all these years.
Well, why worry?
With the taxes the government will soon take it away from him.
Aye, perhaps you're right.
It isn't such a good morning after all.
Now you said it.
- Hannah.
- Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?
On the mantelpiece you'll find my tobacco pouch.
- Will you get it?
- All right, Mr. Jaeckel.
Yeah, seems everyone is full of troubles.
Ah, everyone.
Look at Hannah, poor girl.
A hard worker.
Can't get a job.
Father was killed in the war.
Mother died last year.
Can't earn enough to pay the rent for her room. What can I do?
I can't throw her out.
- You'll need some more tobacco.
- Where are you going?
I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.
Oh, you'd better take the key.
Mrs. Jaeckel and myself are going out.
I'm locking up all the doors... in case the storm troopers will start their monkey business again.

# As we go marching by ##
Look, fellas! Tomatoes!
And potatoes!
I think I'll take a box home.
Mister, please, please.
Hey, fellas, the truck!
Hold it there, will ya!
You have no right to do this.
That's all right.
Just charge it to my account.
Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!
Why don't some of you do something?
I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.
Now what would you do, my pretty maid?
Ah, you're very brave all together, but not one of ya got guts to stand up alone and fight.
- Aw, shut up!
- Is that why you got a truck?
- To run away in case somebody hits you back?
- Shut up, or we'll take you down.
All right, come on and take me.
You'll get a lot of medals for it.
That's all you can do is to pick on women and rob defenseless people.
Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.
Here!
Oh, I'll have to do it all over again.
Pigs.
- Send in patient 33.
- Yes, sir.
Here's an interesting case.
Amnesia. Jewish soldier.
Been here since the war.
Has an idea he's been here only a few weeks.
Has he any idea what's happened in the meantime?
Not the least.
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop, which he believes he left only a few weeks ago.
Poor devil. He'll have many surprises waiting for him.
I'm afraid so.
- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.
Gone?
But he was to be examined.
- I know, sir, but he disappeared.
- Disappeared?
Well, let him go.
It isn't a serious case.
Besides, there's little more we can do for him.
Hey, go on.
Beat it up there.
Come on! Get outta -
You! Go on!
What do you think you're doing?
- I really don't know.
- Well, you leave that alone.
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!
I appreciate that.
When you talk to me, hail Hynkel and salute.
Who are you anyway?
I'll show you who I am.
Come down to headquarters.
- Say, that's my shop!
- I don't care if it is or not.
- You leave me alone!
- Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?
Come on down, pal.
I'll show you.
Now let me tell you something -
Are you a policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone!
Attacking a storm trooper, huh?
- Take him down!
- You'll hear from my lawyer!
- Come on, you little -
- Why, you -
Turn him around!
He bit my finger!
Pardon.
Oh, I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't mean to hit you.
You were wonderful.
I enjoyed that.
- But don't stand there. You'd better beat it.
- No, I'll call a policeman.
- No, no, don't do that.
- Why not?
You crazy?
- Look out. There's more coming.
- More what?
Wait a minute!
Come in here!
What's wrong with you?
There's no use being foolhardy.
- Who?
- Shh!
Stop the car!
Hello! What's this?
Who hit you?
- I don't know. I think there were a gang of 'em.
- Here, you'd better go along, get fixed up.
We'll investigate later.
- What time is it?
- Come on. Get in.
I don't see what is -
It's all right now.
They've gone.
Thanks, mister.
That did me a lot of good.
You sure got nerve, the way you fought back.
That's what we should all do - fight back.
We can't fight alone, but we can lick 'em together.
We didn't do so bad, did we?
So long.
Oh, excuse me.
You're the barber, the one that was in the hospital.
Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
We didn't think you were ever coming back.
But the storm troopers, they'll be looking for ya.
Storm troopers?
You'd better hide.
Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.
- Is this the man?
- That's him.
Hail Hynkel.
Who's he?
Don't fool with me.
I said, hail Hynkel!
- All right.
- Put out your hands.
Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
Bring him outside.
Yes. Come on, you.
Come on!
Before we take you down you'll finish this. Here.
Go on. Paint that.
Why, you -
That's him!
Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!
I've got an idea.
A bright idea.
Sure! That's it!
- And... give it the works!
- Heave ho!
Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!
Attention!
First in command.
- Yes, sir.
- What the -
Second in command.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, never mind.
- You!
- Yes, sir.
What the devil goes on here? And who told you to hang people from lampposts?
- No one, sir.
- My orders were to keep these streets tidy.
- What was the trouble?
- A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir.
- Where is he?
- There.
Break ranks.
Oh, so there you are.
Stand him up.
Get up.
You!
Don't you remember me?
The war.
You saved my life.
- Me?
- Strange.
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Well, don't you remember?
The enemy tried to capture us, but we got away in my plane.
Plane?
And then we crashed.
Cra -
Oh, yes.
Now I remember.
- Well, how are you?
- What has my friend done?
Our men were painting his windows,
Commander, and he resisted.
Any brave man would resist.
- I'm sorry this occurred.
- Oh. No harm.
I'm sure that in the future you will not be molested again.
However, if you or your friends are ever in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know.
Who did that?
Oh. One of my friends.
Oh. Of course.
Hynkel's palace was the center of a gigantic enterprise...
an enterprise that would build the world's greatest war machine.
Behind this undertaking was the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...
whose amazing genius ran the entire nation...
whose ceaseless activity kept him busily occupied every moment of the day.
Hup!
Marshal Herring is waiting,
Your Excellency.
Enough.
Hail Hynkel.
Your Excellency,
I believe we've got something now.
A bulletproof uniform.
Material as light as silk.
- Where is it?
- I've arranged for a demonstration in the anteroom.
It will only take two minutes.
I can spare one.
- Professor Herr Kibitzen!
- Hail Hynkel!
Your Excellency, actions speak louder than words.
- A bulletproof uniform!
- And 100% perfect!
Shoot.
Far from perfect.
Zevell!
- My secretary. Where is she?
- In the outer office, Your Excellency.
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.
Hail Hynkel.
Take a letter.
No! No, no!
- Hello?
- This is Field Marshal Herring.
I'm in the Tower Room.
We've got something marvelous.
All right. I shall be up.
- What is it?
- A parachute.
The most compact in the world.
Worn like an ordinary hat.
It will open in 25 feet.
Demonstrate, Professor.
Hail Hynkel!
Herring, why do you waste my time like this?
Send Garbitsch here.
Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency.
Enough.
Hail Hynkel.
Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this, these appropriations?
25 million for prison camps when we need every penny for the manufacturing of munitions.
- We've had to make a few arrests.
- A few? How many?
Nothing astronomical.
Five or ten thousand.
- Oh.
- A day.
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters, that's all.
- What do they dissent about?
- The working hours. The cut in wages.
Chiefly, the synthetic food - the quality of the sawdust in the bread.
What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply.
Nevertheless, the condition is getting dangerous.
The people are overworked.
They need diversion.
The people? Bah!
We might go a little further with the Jews.
Burn down some of their houses.
Spectacular assault on the ghetto now might prove diverting.
We must do something more dramatic.
Now is the time to invade Osterlich.
- How soon can we be ready?
- According to Herring, three months.
I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's army might invade Osterlich before me.
We must strike now.
In that case, we should require foreign capital.
- Borrow it. Borrow it.
- The bankers have all refused.
But wait. There's one man who might make us a loan - Epstein.
Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?
Yes.
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow the money from Epstein.
It might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people.
Very well then.
We'll change our policy towards his people.
Tell Commander Schultz that in future all persecution of the Jews must cease... at least until we've negotiated this loan.
I don't understand it.
The whole ghetto is so quiet now.
You can't imagine what was going on while you were away.
Oh, this Hynkel business.
You weren't here.
You were in the hospital, unconscious.
Believe me, you don't appreciate what a good time you were having.
Well, if things get worse we can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.
Sooner or later we'll have to go.
- Excuse me.
- Anyway... it's nice to see you back.
It's like the old days again, eh?
- Yes.
- How's business?
Very slow. Very slow.
Trouble is, the men are all in concentration camps.
You should go in for fixing up the women.
Nice money in the beauty parlor business.
You know anything about it?
Me? No.
Well, you can learn.
You can practice on Hannah.
Yes!
Of course.
Hannah, get up in that chair.
We are going to make you look beautiful.
Beautiful? What for?
He's going to practice on you for a beauty parlor.
You're not gonna put mud on my face, are you?
Ah, we are going to take some off.
Make me look beautiful?
Sure. We can't make you look any worse.
- Hannah!
- Oh, there's Mrs. Shoemaker for the laundry.
That's all right.
I'll give it to her.
- You sit here and enjoy yourself.
- What?
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.
I like your shop since we fixed it up.
I wish I had a business like this.
There's no future in housework.
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop someday.
But I can never save.
Money slips through my fingers like that.
Trouble is, I've always lived up to every penny I've earned.
Why shouldn't I? You're here today and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?
- Do you believe in God?
- Well -
I do. But if there wasn't one, would you live any different?
I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone.
Things are looking brighter now.
Maybe you're the reason, saving Commander Schultz's life.
Funny how they've left us alone lately.
Seems too good to be true.
Do you ever daydream?
I do.
That's the only time I'm really happy - dreaming.
Back.
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?
- Do you know we're very much alike?
- Are we?
Yeah.
We're both absentminded.
- You think so?
- Yes.
I like absentminded people.
Do you know the story about the man that put his watch in boiling water... and held the egg in his hand?
No!
Very good.
They say all great men are absentminded.
It's a sign they're smart.
My folks didn't think so.
Of course there's an excuse for you.
You were injured in the war.
I was born that way.
Wonder why women never grow whiskers.
Hmm? What?
I s -
What -
- Oh, my!
- Isn't that foolish of me!
I could kick myself in the shins, I could.
I'll give you a shampoo.
That's good.
Voilà.
Gee.
Ain't I cute!
How'd you do it?
You should try it on yourself.
If you were fixed up, you'd look handsome.
- Yes?
- Yes!
No.
Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!
There's the potato man.
I have to go.
Potatoes!
One, please!
Take it easy there.
Well, did you hurt yourself?
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.
How do you do?
Something's happened. I know it.
The storm troopers, they helped me up.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they stopped hating us... if they'd leave us alone and let us go about our business like we used to.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't have to leave and go to another country?
I don't want to go away. With all the hardship and the persecution, I love it here.
Perhaps we don't have to go.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
Period.
Danke schoen.
Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
Not even a sharp pencil!
I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers!
- I'll get you a pen.
- Don't bother.
I won't send it.
Get out! Get out! Get out!
We've just discovered the most wonderful, the most marvelous poison gas!
It will kill everybody!
All right, later, later, later.
B-76 to see Herr Herring.
- Who's that?
- A lady.
My secret agent.
Your secret agent.
Tell her to come here.
Have B-76 come right in.
Hail Hynkel.
- Oh, Garbitsch, what do you hear from Epstein?
- Most encouraging.
Our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans, so the loan is bound to go through.
- Good.
- Hail Hynkel.
Come here.
- Well?
- The men are planning a strike at the arms factory.
- Who's the leader?
- There were five of them.
- Have them shot.
- They were, Your Excellency.
- How many do you say were going on strike?
- The whole factory - 3,000 of them.
Have them all shot. I don't want any of my workers dissatisfied.
But, Your Excellency, these men are skilled craftsmen.
Why not let them work till they can train others, then shoot them?
We cannot afford to be lenient!
The whole rhythm of production will be affected if you shoot them now.
"Rhythm of production. "
All right, have your rhythms.
You may instruct your operatives to spare the strikers and permit them to return to work... but to mark them for future reference.
That is my department.
I'll attend to that.
This way, madam.
Strange. These strike leaders - they're all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.
Brunettes are troublemakers.
They're worse than the Jews.
Then wipe them out.
Doucement.
Not so fast.
We get rid of the Jews first.
Then concentrate on the brunettes.
We shall never have peace until we have a pure Aryan race.
How wonderful.
Tomainia, a nation of blue-eyed blondes.
Why not a blonde Europe, a blonde Asia, a blonde America?
- A blonde world.
- And a brunette dictator.
Dictator of the world.
Why not?
Aut Caesar aut nulles.
The world is effete, worn-out, afraid.
No nation would dare to oppose you.
- Dictator of the world!
- It's your destiny.
We'll kill off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes.
Then will come forth our dream - a pure Aryan race.
- Beautiful blonde Aryans.
- They will love you. They will adore you.
- They will worship you as a god!
- No, no! You mustn't say it!
You make me afraid of myself.
Yes, dictator of the world.
We'll start with the invasion of Osterlich.
After that we won't have to fight.
We can bluff.
Nation after nation will capitulate.
Within two years the world will be under your thumb!
Leave me.
I want to be alone.
Aut Caesar aut nulles.
Emperor of the world!
My world.
This is the Happy Hour program.
Make your work a pleasure.
Move with the rhythm of music.
Our next selection:
Brahms' "Hungarian Dance No. 5."
Fifteen cents, please.
The Happy Hour program now signing off.
At 6:00 all stations will carry
Adenoid Hynkel's address...
to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross.
Seems like the old days again, don't it?
I wonder how long they are going to last.
Don't you read the papers?
It is rumored that Hynkel is going to give the Jewish people back their rights.
Hmm. Maybe.
What do you want?
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us anymore.
Now don't that make you feel good?
No, sir.
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is, you're so used to bad times you're unhappy without them.
Mary? Mary!
Get my Sunday shoes.
- You'll find them on the window sill.
- All right.
- I can't find the shawl.
- Don't bother. I've got the shawl.
- What's going on upstairs?
- It's Hannah.
They're dressing her up to go out this evening.
- Is that so?
- She's got a beau.
- Who is it?
- The barber.
Now turn around.
Oh, my dear, those hands.
- What's the matter with them?
- Those calluses - they're so rough.
- Maybe I'd better not go.
- Don't be foolish.
He knows you do housework.
Wait a minute.
I'll get a pair of mittens from Mrs. Morris.
- Mrs. Morris?
- Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!
Aggie.
- Yeah?
- See if he's ready yet.
All right.
Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.
Bad news.
The invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed.
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend us the money.
Epstein refuses, huh?
Send for Schultz!
Commander Schultz.
Epstein refuses!
That contemptible Epstein!
What did he say?
He complained of the persecution of his people... and said under no circumstances would he have any dealings with a medieval maniac.
He'll deal with a medieval maniac more than he thinks!
First I shall deal with "his people. "
Your Excellency?
Schultz, call out the storm troopers.
We're going to stage a little medieval entertainment in the ghetto.
At such a time, Your Excellency,
I think it's ill-advised.
What?
Demonstrations of this kind are demoralizing the whole country.
Indeed.
And since when have you been so concerned about the ghetto?
I speak in the interests of our party and for the cause of humanity.
Schultz.
You need a vacation.
Fresh air.
A little outdoor exercise.
I shall send you to a concentration camp.
Guards!
Place Commander Schultz under arrest.
Very well, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people.
Your policy is worse than a crime.
It's a tragic blunder.
Traitor! Traitor!
You're nothing but a double-dyed democrat!
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?
Excellency, here are the notes for your speech.
Thank you.
I'll not need them.
What I say tonight will not be directed to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross... but to the children of Israel.
- Ah. Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good night.
Good night.
Do you know, that Hynkel isn't such a bad fella after all.
Most amusing.
Here you are.
Get a Hynkel button. Get a Hynkel button.
A fine photo of the Phooey on each and every button.
Two? Here you are, young man.
... the double-crossin'!
But the Juden! The Juden!
...und the ghetto...
The ghetto -
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.
Come on, let's hurry.
Wait a minute. No!
...the Juden. The Juden -
The Juden! The Juden!
Hey.
What's that?
Turn off the radio!
Listen!
# The Aryan, the Aryan #
It's the storm troopers!
No, no!

Mother, get the women and children up here.
Lock all the doors.
Here. You men, stay right here.
We've got to make a stand.
We might as well die as to go on living like this.
# The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #
Wait a minute!
We have a social call to make here!
It's Hynkel!
Wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?
Commander Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court.
These Jews were attacking storm troopers.
I don't care what they were doing.
The orders were to keep out of here.
There! You saw that for yourself!
I can't help it.
Those are Commander Schultz's orders.
Come on. Let's get going.
Come on.
# Aryan #
# The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan ##
Orders or no orders,
I'm gonna get that girl.
Out.
Aww.
Extry! Paper!
- Schultz arrested! Paper!
- Did you hear that?
- He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- What?
Commander Schultz has been arrested!
- TTroopers!
- Listen.
- A Jew corrupted our commander!
- Let's kill the lot of them!
Commander Schultz is under arrest, accused of treason!
And you know why. Schultz was a friend of the ghetto, a friend of that barber!
- Let's get the barber!
- We want the barber!
We want the barber!
- It's the storm troopers! They're after you!
- We want the barber!
- You better get up on the roof.
- No. I'll stay here.
Come on! They'll kill you!
- No, I'll stay and fight!
- Don't be a fool!
Do you want to be murdered?
Get on to the roof. Quick!
- Come on! Come on!
- Agar, get inside.
We want the barber!
We want the barber!
We want the barber!
All right, here we are!
Smash in the door! Come on!
Come on, boys!
Come on, boys!
We'll give the barber a haircut!
- All right, where are the bombs?
- Come on. This way!
Let 'er go!
# Aryan, the Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #
There goes the barbershop.
Never mind. We can start again.
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.
Wonderful green fields, and they grow apples and grapes.
Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard in Osterlich.
And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there, he said he'd take me with him.
Now we can all go together.
It'll be wonderful living in the country.
Much better than a smoky old city.
And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money.
We can buy a chicken farm.
There's nice money to be made in chickens.
Look at that star.
Isn't it beautiful?
One thing - Hynkel with all his power can never touch that.
It's all right now.
The coast is clear. Listen.
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.
What?
He's holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
Hannah, you too come down... and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.
All right. I'll be down.
I don't understand it.
This crazy midnight supper.
What does this Commander Schultz want of us?
He wants us to blow up the palace.
What?
We Jewish people shouldn't get mixed up in such a business.
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.
I knew he was up to some mischief.
Sure, he is!
I came in the kitchen this evening... and found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.
Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?
We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
In order to carry out this plan, one of us must die.
In ancient times, the Aryan tribe of Langobardians... made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
Tonight at this feast one of you will be chosen.
Each man will receive a pudding.
Concealed in one of these is a coin.
Whoever gets that coin must give up his life for the liberation of his people.
But he will join the long line of history's noble martyrs... and will rid his country of a tyrant.
Ooh!
I know that it is the wish of all of us... to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal...
I cannot.
Why?
Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.
It must be done by somebody like us.
I can't see it like that.
Gentlemen, if this is a question of my honor, it's very embarrassing.
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.
And let me say on behalf of myself and the others... that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator.
Until then, hail Hynk -
Oh, what am I saying?
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor.
Proceed.
Gentlemen, the coin is here.
What's the meaning of all this?
Somebody made a fool of us.
- You're quite right. I did.
- What?
I put a coin in every pudding.
Mr. Jaeckel!
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people.
We're in enough trouble as it is.
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.
Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs.
Good night.
What's this?
Good night.
Good morning.
By the papers they are saying Commander
Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.
Here it is. Read it for yourself.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Hannah, here. Read that.
"Mystery still surrounds the disappearance... of ex-Commander Schultz.
At police headquarters it was believed that the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.
A certain Jewish barber, reported to be a friend of Schultz... is also wanted for questioning. "
Me?
Well, if it's just for questioning, it can't be serious.
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning, and we never heard of him since.
Shh!
- Who is it?
- It's me - Mr. Mann.
Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?
- How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?
- How do you do?
Did you hear what they're saying in the papers... about Commander Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
Oh, I know, I know.
Well, don't you think that it's serious for you if they find him here in the house?
Shh!
Don't you realize there are spies everywhere?
Spies?
What's the matter with him?
Didn't you read he's wanted for questioning?
Oy.
Where's the commander?
He's in the next room.
Let me tell you.
If Commander Schultz is found in this house... we'll all go to the concentration camp for life and get our heads cut off in the bargain.
Am I giving you an argument?
Then get rid of him.
You can't throw him out.
Of course not.
But I should like to know, how long is he going to stay here?
That's all.
Come. Your breakfast is on the table.
- Mr. Mann?
- Thank you.
I have breakfast waiting at home.
Take the other side of the street and search every house.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- What's wrong now?
- They're looking for Commander Schultz.
- Commander Schultz?
- He's supposed to be hiding in one of those houses.
Oh, they're always looking for somebody.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in!
- For heaven's sake, hurry up!
- Open the door.
- They're coming this way.
- What?
The storm troopers are searching every house.
Quick! Tell the commander.
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- The storm troopers, they're going to search the house.
- What?
- You'd better get up on the roof. Quick! Both of you!
Wait a minute!
- We can't leave all these things about.
- That's right. All of you, pack my valises.
You pack this valise.
- Clear this shelf. Quickly.
- Oh, yes.
Pack this and this.
Oh, this mustn't be found here.
Open the door.
Listen! They are here!
Get up on the roof. Quick!
- I'll take this.
- Be sure they don't leave anything behind.
- My golf clubs.
- The hatbox!
- Here. Take this.
- Come on! Let's hurry!
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with him.
You stay here. You'll see him later.
Here. Take this.
- I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
- All right.
Oh, take this.
Come on. Quick! Come on.
Open in the name of Hynkel!
Stop!
- Look where you are.
- Look where?
Look where you are.
Wait, I can't - I can't see.
Wait a moment.
- My bag! You've dropped it!
- No, it's right here. Here it is.
Don't drop the other one!
Don't drop the other one!
My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!
Come off of there. They'll see you.
Quick! This way!
Whoa! Steady!
Now be careful.
Yes, sir.
You were lucky you didn't break your neck.
Yes, sir.
You'll pardon me.
Sorry.
You guard the back -
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
I shall have to bother you again.
There he is!
Well, good morning. How are you?
Oh, so-so.
Commander Schultz, who's your friend?
Remember, your silence will be appreciated.
- Yes, sir.
- Take him down to the wagon.
Come on.
- Hey! Where you going?
- To the smoking room.
Ah, come on! Down this way!
Osterlich.
Ja.
Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce... that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
This was made possible by the enterprise and genius... of Field Marshal Herring... upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
...der Wiener schnitzel -
...da genius.
Turn around. No. Ah, yes.
Gentlemen... to Field Marshal Herring.
To the invasion of Osterlich.
Elephant.
Hello? Yes. Yes.
Wait.
Napaloni's mobilized his army on the Osterlich front.
What?
Already 60,000 men are on the border.
He's going to take Osterlich!
I can't believe it.
You can't believe it?
But, Your Excellency, I -
- You let him steal a march on us!
- No, I -
You can't believe it?
I did everything that was -
I had the ground covered.
Haven't you any brains?
..."pinheaden"...
No! No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no - No!
- Declare war on Napaloni!
- Napaloni?
Yes, Napaloni! Listen, you blockhead! Mobilize every division of the army and the air force.
- Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
- But war will be the end of us.
- Do as I tell you.
- Madness.
- Shut up!
- Very well. Will you sign this?
- Yes, I'll - What is it?
- A declaration of war.
I'll sign it. A pen.
I'll sign it.
A pen!
I'll sign it! Napaloni.
Der grosser peanut!
Der cheesy ravioli!
There!
Hello?
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.
Napaloni?
- You talk to him.
- What shall I say?
Be nice, affable, pleasant.
Hello?
Well, well, well. How are you?
Fine.
No, he hasn't been playing very much lately.
You went around in '92? Really?
You want to speak to His Excellency?
Just now he's a little hoarse.
Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk.
May I take a message?
He says no doubt you've heard of the movement of his troops on the Osterlich front... and he'd like to discuss the matter with you.
Ask him to come here.
His Excellency would be delighted to invite you to Tomainia... where you could discuss the matter.
Very well.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.
Good-bye, Your Excellency.
He's coming.
Good. We'll give him the works.
We'll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known!
Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.
What shall I do with this?
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.
Peace is declared.
2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square...
awaiting the arrival of Benzine Napaloni.
Entering the station is our beloved Phooey, ready to greet his distinguished guest.
This historic meeting will cement a friendship...
that has long existed between our Phooey and the dictator of Bacteria.
Order... arms!
His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador.
- How do you do?
- Thank you, sir.
Garbitsch.
See about the photography.
When Their Excellencies meet... tell the press to see that our Phooey is well-photographed.
- Full face, not the back of his head.
- Yes, sir.
Benzino Napaloni's private train is now coming into the station.
And from a pink and white car...
- Napaloni and his wife will step onto a crimson carpet...
- Present arms!
where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome.
What's the matter with this stupid -
Hey! What's all of this-a mix-up-a?
Come on. They've gone too far.
At ease! Bring along the carpet.
Papa, why can't we get out here?
- There is no carpet.
- Who cares about a carpet?
Il Dig-a-Ditchy, me - Napaloni.
I never get out without a carpet.
Come on.
Lay it down here. Quick.
- Hurry up!
- It's going back again!
What?
What do you do? You salami?
Let's get out!
Let's get out while it's stopping!
Shut up!
Hurry. Quick. Put it down.
Take it away. Take it away.
Stay here. Stay here until they've made up their mind.
You got-a the carpet?
Well, put 'em-a down!
Hmm. Oh, come on, come on.
Here he is.
- My friend!
- Napaloni!
- This is indeed a pleasure.
- Thank you.
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.
Pictures, Your Excellencies?
Oh, sure. Salute!
Another one, please.
Ah, this is really a pleasure to be here, my friend Hynkel.
Oh, you want another picture?
Just a moment.
There.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- My bambino!
- All right. It's all right-a, Mama.
- Get rid of those men.
- Where is my ambassador?
- Dismissed.
- There you are. Hello, Spook.
- Your Excellency.
How do you feel?
Good! Look after Mama.
Oh, Hynkie, did you meet-a my wife?
- Your wife?
- That's her.
- I -
- Let's go.
Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.
Present... arms!
Napaloni! Napaloni!
Clock is a-two minutes-a slow.
This way.
Napaloni! Napaloni!
Napaloni!
It's-a very nice-a people.
- I say, the people are very nice.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- He is my husband!
- Keep back!
- You make a mistake!
- Let me go!
- You make a big-a mistake-a!
- Get back!
Please!
At all costs, Napaloni shall not invade Osterlich.
That country belongs to me.
At this meeting we shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
This interview is solely to impress upon him the force of your personality.
- Hmm.
- To make him feel your superiority.
This man Napaloni is aggressive, domineering.
Before we make our demands, we must put him in his place.
- Precisely. But how?
- By means of applied psychology.
In other words, by making him feel inferior.
This can be done in many subtle ways.
For instance, at this interview,
I have so arranged... that he will always be looking up at you... you looking down at him.
At all times his position will be inferior.
Mmm. Excellent.
Then again, we shall seat him here beside your bust... so that if you relax, that will always be glaring at him.
And?
Where is he now?
Resting.
When he arrives, I have arranged... that he shall enter from the far end of the room.
Another psychological triumph.
He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire length of the floor toward you.
Very good.
Yes?
His Excellency
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.
He's coming! He's coming!
Quick, get me a flower. A flower.
Remember, at all times you must be above him, before him.
Entering or leaving, you must be first.
Hello, Hynkie!
Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!
How-a you feel?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ah, my brother dictator!
You are a nice little man, a-Hynkie!
I'm so glad to see you again.
And my friend the Garbitsch!
Hello!
Ah, this is a lovely place.
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice-a cold shower.
And that bathtub - as soon as you get the plumbing fixed, it'll be in-a good-a shape.
Your Excellency, won't you sit down.
Oh, shoot, shoot.
Well-a, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you -
I must be-a growing.
Not sure why they gave me a baby stool.
This-a stool is not for me.
I like it-a better up-a-stairs here.
You know-a something, Garbitsch?
This is a lovely country.
Very nice-a people.
I thought the public extremely enthusiastic on your arrival.
Sure. They like to see new faces.
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.
What's that? What's that?
I'm sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the - at the rail -
Madam Napaloni at the railway station.
Oh, she's not used to public life.
She can't take it.
Match.
Oh - I'm sorry. I'm -
No, that's all right.
Don't apologize. I find-a one.
I am simply crazy about this a-palace.
Ivory and gold - that makes a lovely combination.
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Say, tell me something-a, Garbitsch.
What's on the program?
- There's the grand ball this evening.
- Grand ball?
The grand ball. And this afternoon, a review of the army.
Review of the army?
Well, that won't take-a long.
- I'm afraid it will.
- Oh? So you got a big army, huh?
Modesty forbids.
Yes, seems I've heard something about it.
If I'm gonna review the army,
I think I'll get me a shave.
- We have a barbershop in the palace.
- Is that so?
Hynkie, you look a little blue under the gills.
- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.
- Good!
- Very well. This way.
Ah, this is the barbershop.
I can-a smell 'em.
Ah, now this is-a sweet - a- very sweet.
- Do you like it? It was the emperor's library.
- Makes a good a-barbershop.
- Too old fashioned. I want something modern.
- Is that so?
You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous.
I like something to look at.
So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling... so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.
And when it's tipped this way,
I shall have a view through the glass ceiling.
- What's above-a the ceiling?
- The ballroom.
Then in my summer palace
I have a barbershop.
Is that so?
Yes.
That also has glass walls.
You don't tell me.
Oh, yes.
With goldfish swimming inside.
Wait a minute.
Goldfish swimming inside-a the walls?
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feed 'em?
You can't. They're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new barbershop.
- Very interesting. Very interesting.
- Yes? Do you like it?
This is the Hynkel Stadium.
Before a half million spectators, the greatest display of arms the world has ever known...
marches by in review.
Our beloved Phooey and Il Dig-a-Ditchy are seated...
in the reviewing stand, thrilled by this historic event.
What?
Nothing. I'm just chewing.
- Ah, yes.
- Would you care for some peanuts?
- Thank you. I've had some.
- Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook.
Now passing -
Tomainia's heavy artillery.
It's all right.
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
I just called up a half hour ago to start 'em over.
- Where are they coming from?
- Aroma.
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.
That's right. They should be here now.
I don't know what's detaining them.
Now passing -
Tomainia's light artillery.
Hmm. That's very light.
And here come the armored tanks...
the pride of Tomainia's army.
The latest design, the last word in modern warfare.
Wait a minute.
Where's the propellers?
- Propellers?
- Sure. For going under the water.
- Tanks that go under the water?
- Submarine work!
You never heard of aero-marine tanks that go under the water and then fly up-a-stairs?
- What's that?
- Tanks that go under the water and fly in the air.
Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now.
We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
Flying dreadnoughts.
- What's that?
- My planes!
Now passing -
Hynkel's flying division number 34.
Our planes!
You're right. They're yours.
Ah, Garbitsch.
The invasion of Osterlich.
It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border.
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting - duck shooting or something.
At the appointed time, you will show up at the village of Pretzelberg... meet the army, step into an automobile and cross over into Osterlich.
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital to receive you.
First, Napaloni must remove his troops from the border.
That question will be decided tonight.
Where is Napaloni?
I'll see if I can find him.
In the meantime... it might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
It'll carry weight.
You mean I will carry weight.
You find him. Let me know at once.
- Madam Napaloni.
- Your Excellency.
Why so triste?
'Cause I no speak-a.
No? May I have the pleasure of this dance?
Oh, yes.
Allow me.
Madam, your dancing was superb.
Excellent.
Very good.
Good.
- Ah, my dear Adenoid!
- Benzine!
I've been-a looking for you all evening.
What do you say we have a sandwich... go to some quiet little place where we can sit down and talk-a things over, huh?
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea! Gentlemen, to the buffet.
Of course. This way.
There's an old Tomainian proverb.
That's very funny! I wish I understand it.
Now, about the border situation.
- Ah, yes, yes. No problem.
- Oh, it should be no trouble at all.
- Shh, shh.
- Not at all.
- What's the matter?
- Wait.
Out!
You two, out!
Out.
- Out?
- Out.
Out?
Out.
As I was saying, about the border question.
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.
- Just a matter of detail. Mere formalities.
Strawberries.
Pardon me.
Have you English mustard?
- English mustard, Your Excellency.
- That's the hot-a stuff?
- Very hot.
- Ah, good shape, good shape.
- Cream.
- Cream, Your Excellency.
Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm gonna make this very simple.
This is the treaty -
You agree not to invade Osterlich...
I agree not to invade Osterlich.
We sign-a the treaty, then I remove-a my troops from the border.
Good. In other words, when your troops are off the border, I sign.
- That's-a right.
- Very good.
Oh, just a minute.
You don't understand.
First we sign-a the treaty, then I remove-a the troops.
Precisely. I sign when your troops are off the border.
Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.
Hold-a this.
Now, look.
You a-sign this-a treaty a-first... then I remove-a the troops after.
- Well, what are we arguing about?
- You just said I remove-a the troops a-first.
You don't expect me to sign while your troops are there on the border?
You don't expect me to remove-a the troops until you sign?
- Why not?
- Why should I?
- Why shouldn't you? Osterlich is a free country.
- So?
Your soldiers are there, on the Osterlich border!
And they'll stay there until you sign this-a treaty!
You'll take them off, or I'll blow them off!
Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere.
Your Excellency, to quote an old Latin phrase -
He's a-right! Speak-a to him!
Strawberries.
Where's my-a sandwich?
Well, give me another one!
- Can't we sit down and discuss this -
- I'm a guest-a here.
Nobody talk to me in my own-a joint like that!
Can't we sit down and discuss this thing without passion?
I am not-a passionate.
I am-a just, that's all.
I want him to sign-a the treaty.
I'll remove the troops.
Can't you understand?
What would my people think... signing such a treaty when your soldiers are there on the Osterlich border?
I will not-a move a-soldiers until you-a sign!
Not until you clear that border will I sign anything.
- Then my soldiers remain!
- Then I kick them off!
One move-a from you, Hynkie, and my artillery take-a like this and blow you to pieces!
Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!
You want to start a world-a war?
I'll get you one!
You and the world!
I'll throw in the ocean!
- Mmm!
- Gentlemen, please!
I'm-a coming home!
I cannot talk to this ignoramus!
Strawberries!
Your Excellency, we have a very important position... that I must urge upon you.
I know what you must -
If you would -
What's wrong?
I don't give a hoopy!
I got-a my guns here in the pass!
If he start-a something,
I'll blow him to "passes!"
Excellency, what's the matter?
What ails you? What has -
- Your Excellency, this isn't like you.
- Hey! What is the matter?
Hey, Garbitsch, come here!
What is the matter with-a Hynkie?
He's put mustard on his strawberries.
Mustard -
What else-a can you expect from Hynkie?
Il Dig-a-Ditchy!
What? What's the matter? What?
My little bambino!
...the Bacterian -
... Tomainia -
You cannot treat-a the Bacterian people this way!
I'll take the Bacterian people and I'll tear them apart like this!
- Excellency, please!
- Look! Look what he's-a doing!
It's an insult to my people!
Look, he's-a pulling spaghetti!
The spaghetti!
He either sign-a the treaty, or we have a war!
- Ooh!
- Listen! Listen!
Give me a-something! Quick!
Give me a-something! I want to -
- But it's all right. I have an appointment.
- What's this?
I'm from the international press.
How's the conference progressing?
Very successfully. How did you get in?
Excuse me, will you?
How did this man get in here?
You know the regulations of the palace in regard to reporters. Go down to Captain Block.
Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter the palace under any circumstances tonight.
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Of course, there are minor details to be cleaned up, things that you must -
Excuse me. We're very busy.
- Oh!
- Gentlemen, please!
The press are outside. The whole world will know that we're fighting.
- So what?
- Can't we come to some agreement?
- Not until he-a signs!
- I sign nothing!
Your Excellency,
I must speak to you alone.
- Do you mind?
- Mind? I don't a-mind!
- What is it?
- Sign. Sign.
Why should he have the advantage?
What does it matter, a mere scrap of paper?
The moment you sign, he'll take his troops off the border.
We can move in without losing a man.
I'll sign.
What?
Hold-a this!
Ah, my little Hynkie!
My-a dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble!
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms!
Officers tied up in the guard room!
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped! Come on!
The planes are searching for us.
Let's make for the woods.
No. We must keep in the open.
The border's that way.
The invasion of Osterlich.
Now... or never.
Ducks!
Did you hear that?
Came from over there. Come on.
Da Blitzen!
Cheese and crackers!
...da Blitzen!
A yodeler, huh?
Where'd you get that outfit?
- What?
- Don't answer back!
Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, huh?
- He'll talk when he gets into camp!
- Come on!
There it is - the village of Pretzelberg.
Pretzelberg.
If we can pass through there, we're safe across the Osterlich border.
- Couldn't we go through the woods?
- Of course not.
The woods are swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.
We must face the music.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.
We must bluff our way through.
Remember, you're a storm trooper.
Here they come.
Can you see what they're doing?
- They're looking this way.
- Well, pay no attention. Keep going.
They're beginning to follow us.
Shall we run?
Certainly not.
- Just a little bit?
- Keep walking.
We could walk a little faster.
Hmm? Make up your mind.
- Perhaps we'd better slow down.
- No, no. Keep going.
- There's no hurry.
- Come on.
- What is it?
- He's here!
What? Bugler! Sound assembly!
Company! Attention!
Present... arms!
- You don't want to change your mind and turn back?
- No, keep going. Keep going.
- Hail Hynkel.
- Order... arms!
Your Excellency will be pleased to know that everything is under control.
- Good.
- Good.
I have been in continued communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.
- Is that -
- Good.
- Good.
- Are we ready to start?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Gentlemen.
Schultz, I'm certainly happy to see you with us again.
Thank you.
- Where are we going?
- You're invading Osterlich.
Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!
- Hannah!
- Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!
Present... arms!
Hail Hynkel!
Hail Hynkel!
Present... arms!
Your Excellency, the world awaits your word.
What's happened to him?
He looks strange.
And what's Schultz doing here?
Pardoned, I suppose.
Here.
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.
"Corona veniet delectis. "
"Victory shall come to the worthy. "
Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people.
No nation can progress with such ideas.
They stand in the way of action.
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.
In the future, each man will serve the interest of the state with absolute obedience.
Let him who refuses beware.
The rights of citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and other non-Aryans.
They are inferior, and therefore enemies of the state.
It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
Henceforth, this nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire... and the people of this nation will obey the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader... the dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich... the future emperor of the world.
You must speak.
I can't.
You must. It's our only hope.
Hope.
I'm sorry... but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone, if possible -
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich... and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful.
But we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls... has barricaded the world with hate... has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery, we need humanity.
More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent, and all will be lost.
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
These very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men... cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world... millions of despairing men, women and little children... victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed... the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die... and the power they took from the people will return to the people.
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes... men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives... tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel... who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts.
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.
The unloved and the unnatural.
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke it is written...
"The kingdom of God is within man. "
Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men - in you!
You the people have the power - the power to create machines, the power to create happiness!
You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful... to make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power!
Let us all unite!
Let us fight for a new world, a decent world... that will give men a chance to work... that will give youth a future and old age a security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people.
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!
Let us fight to free the world... to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed... with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress... will lead to all men's happiness.
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
Hannah... can you hear me?
Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.
The clouds are lifting.
The sun is breaking through.
We are coming out of the darkness and into the light.
We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world...
where men will rise above their hate...
their greed and brutality.
Look up, Hannah.
The soul of man has been given wings...
and at last he is beginning to fly.
He is flying into the rainbow...
into the light of hope, into the future -
the glorious future...
that belongs to you, to me...
and to all of us.
Look up, Hannah. Look up.
Hannah, did you hear that?
Listen.

We want an increase!
We want to be heard.
We're taxpaying citizens.
We're starving.
We're tired of waiting.
We want to see the minister.
We want to see the minister.
Silence!
You don't have a permit.
You must disperse.
Go home. Go on.
You should be ashamed.
The way you treat us is a disgrace!
Go home. Go on.
Let's go, old geezers. Come on.
Keep him quiet, for God's sake!
Quiet, Flike.
Scoundrels, all of them!
Quiet or they'll hear you and arrest you.
I'm not talking about the police.
I mean the organizers of the protest.
They should have gotten a permit.
They wouldn't give us one.
Then we should have stayed home!
A 20% increase would be enough for me to pay off my debts in a year.
I don't have any debts.
To tell the truth, I don't either.
- This is our chance. We can go.
- Let's go.
Good day.
I have no one, no son or brother, to help me out.
I'm just a good-for-nothing old man.
Orazio Valenti.
Umberto Domenico Ferrari.
Who can live on 18,000 lire these days?
My landlady charges me 10,000.
She even raised my rent, that old -
Go ahead and say it.
We're both men.
If she's a bitch, she's a bitch.
Do you need a watch?
No, I have a watch.
I don't have it with me, but it's a very nice watch.
I have two.
That's why I'm selling this one.
What make is yours?
It's nice. It has a gold case.
Well, here's where I live.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Who's done here?
How rude! I'm not finished.
Thank you.
Waitress.
Listen to this.
In a store it would cost you 20,000 lire.
- How much are you asking?
- 5,000 lire.
My throat feels scratchy.
- Be patient. It'll pass.
- I hope so.
See you tomorrow.
Here we are. He's so cute.
Hey, I saw everything.
Tomorrow I'll kick you out, and your dog too.
I'll kick you out, I said.
You're overreacting.
She'll lose all her customers.
Don't listen to a word she says.
- May I walk with you a while?
- Of course.
You can have it for 4,000.
4,000! That's a lot of money.
But a good watch lasts forever.
I don't care.
Look, I'll give you 3,000 lire.
There's more than that in here.
It's all in small change, I'm afraid.
- I said 4,000.
- It's all in here.
Listen, you can take the bag and give it back to me tomorrow at the cafeteria.
See you.
Spare some change.
See you.
Spare some change.
Who's in my room?
- Who's in my room?
- How should I know?
What's all this yelling?
Be quiet and stop yelling.
How dare you behave like this!
Quiet down and come with me.
Get it through your head.
- It's not your room. It's mine.
- What do you mean, yours?
They're dear friends of mine, just resting for a while.
And why bother making a fuss?
You're leaving at the end of the month anyway.
Leaving.
What a way to treat someone - kicking him out after 20 years!
Watch me! Meanwhile, pay your back rent.
I have the money right here!
Stop yelling!
Who's she think she's going to kick out?
Where would I go?
They skin you alive.
They want 20,000 lire for a rat hole, and then it's full of rodents.
- I know.
- Kick me out!
She charges 1,000 lire an hour for the room, you know.
1,000 lire every time.
- Could you give me the thermometer?
- Yes.
Here.
Do you feel sick?
Not too hard.
Did you hear the door just now?
She put them in the living room.
She could have done that before.
No, she couldn't.
There were two others in there.
The dirty, rotten -
Have you seen all the ants?
Can you see anything, Mr. Umberto?
No, nothing.
You can a little.
Did you know I'm pregnant?
My God.
And you say it just like that?
How do you want me to say it?
- Does she know?
- God forbid.
You can go in now.
Are you sure?
Three months, Mr. Umberto.
- Excuse me.
- Come in.
Come see.
Look.
The tall one is from Naples.
The short one is from Florence.
- Which one is yours?
- Both of them.
Which is the father?
I think... the one from Naples.
What do you mean, you think?
They both deny it.
Come here.
Come on. She's crying.
Answer me!
She's done singing.
Bring me a hot water bottle.
- What are you doing?
- He wants some hot water.
Come on.
Good boy.
Do you want to play with the ball, Flike?
Come in.
I pay the maid.
If you want hot water, hire your own maid.
I'm throwing your things out on the 30th.
I'm evicting you.
Kiss the baby for me.
Did you hear me?
Come here, boy.
Good boy, Flike.
Damn these ants!
Ants everywhere.
- What is it?
- Where's the thermometer?
On the dresser.
I have to put it back.
Otherwise, she'll yell at me.
Come here, please.
What do you want?
Take a look.
What do I have to do?
Look in my throat and tell me if you see a white coating.
It's so big.
Is there a coating?
She's hoping I'll die, but I'm not going to.
Take this to her.
That's 3,000 lire.
And get a receipt.
All right.
Mr. Umberto.
Mr. Umberto.
She says you owe her 15,000, and it's all or nothing.
I've got to go, or she'll yell at me.
Good evening.
How about 2,500?
I said 2,000 yesterday, and I say 2,000 today.
How about 2,400?
They have great sentimental value.
They're practically new.
I've never opened them because I didn't want to ruin them.
I'm only giving them to you because I have a fever.
Maria.
These ants are driving me crazy.
She'll have the rest when I get my pension.
Get me the thermometer.
She's made my fever go up.
To pay my debts, 
I'd have to go a month without food.
Did you do your assignment?
You didn't have time, eh?
Certain things can happen if you don't know your grammar.
Everyone takes advantage of the ignorant.
Now there's more. 
You'll have to wait till the 27th for the rest.
This is ridiculous.
First 3,000, then 2,000 more.
Take them back to him.
It's all or nothing.
Either he gives me 15,000 lire or I evict him. Go.
Well?
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Go right in.
Excuse me.
What are you doing? Down there.
Madam is at the end of the corridor.
Maria, shut the door!
Her fiancé.
I was the only successful one in all Macerata.
Good-bye.
Till tomorrow.
Yes.
What is it?
Yes, a cold.
San Martino della Battaglia 14.
Third floor.
Thank you.
What's going on?
Come in.
Stay there. I'll come to you.
Who's Mr. Ferrari?
I am.
I got dressed so I wouldn't keep you waiting.
Sorry. Umberto Domenico Ferrari.
Spalmagulli, Armando.
Please, come in.
I'll just shut my suitcase and then I'm ready.
Mr. Umberto, are you seriously ill?
Yes, it's serious.
Serious.
- You're leaving us in the dark over here.
- Shut up.
Are you kidding?
What are you looking at?
Come here. Good boy.
If he realizes I'm leaving, it'll be the end.
Down, boy.
Do me a favor.
Play with the dog a little.
Here's a ball and ruler.
I don't feel like playing.
I can't say good-bye to him, or he won't let me leave.
Very well.
Go on, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Come and play with the ruler.
- Is your boyfriend down there?
- Leave me alone.
Mr. Umberto.
Don't give him any milk, all right?
And please keep an eye on him.
All right.
He's fine. He's playing.
Please take care of him.
I won't forget you.
I won't be gone long.
Shall we go, Mr. Ferrari?
Yes.
Give me your suitcase.
No, it's very light.
Just pajamas and a bar of soap.
Keep it, then.
Bye.
Maria!
This guy's healthier than I am.
What's he doing here?
I'd like to keep him a little longer, so he can get the full treatment.
All right.
Thank you, Sister.
Say "ah."
That's fine.
Brush his tonsils with iodine.
You can go home tomorrow.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What?
I also have a pain here.
What kind of pain?
Nothing.
Can't you see your fever's gone?
It's just common tonsillitis.
If you were younger, 
I'd tell you to have your tonsils taken out.
But what's the use, at your age?
You should have insisted.
Mr. Umberto, you should have insisted.
I'd really like to save a little money, you know.
I'll teach you how to get them to let you stay here.
All I need is one week.
This ward is better than a hotel.
Did you ask the nun for a rosary?
Thank you. Oh, Sister-
He's such a nice person.
He'd like to stay a little longer.
He needs more treatment.
Can't you see how haggard he looks?
Just imagine: His pension isn't even enough to support his dog.
We'll see.
Thank you, Sister.
Ask her for a rosary.
Sister.
Could I have a rosary?
How are you, my dear?
I'm fine.
This was all I could bring.
A banana!
Sit down, dear.
Pull up that stool.
May I sit here?
Of course. Sit down.
What about Flike? How is he?
I wanted to bring him upstairs, but it's not allowed.
- He's downstairs in the courtyard.
- In the courtyard.
Flike's in the courtyard.
Shut that window!
Shut it!
So, is that the father?
Mr. Umberto, if you asked me to swear to it, 
I couldn't.
But I sense it was him.
What does he have to say?
Nothing.
When I come back, I'll make him talk.
I'll talk to both of them.
Even the short one, the one from Florence.
Both of them.
Give us another one, Sister.
Good morning, Sister.
Your daughter?
Excuse me, Sister.
How is our father?
He's very ill.
So he asked to borrow 4,000 lire, but I didn't give him a cent.
Good move.
Yes, she's marrying the manager of the movie theater.
That way she can get in for free.
I hope she doesn't have children.
She says you have to leave because she needs your room.
That's why she's getting married.
Absolutely not.
I'm paying my back rent, so she can't kick me out.
She can't evict me.
Mr. Umberto, he's waiting.
I'm not going to the shelter.
Get well soon, Mr. Umberto.
- Tell her I'm not going.
- Yes, I'll tell her.
Let her go to the shelter.
I'm not going!
During the war she called me Grandpa.
I gave her some meat from time to time.
After the war she went crazy.
She even hates my dog.
If you saw my dog, you'd know it's impossible to hate him.
Take care of yourself, Mr. Umberto.
But I'm coming back here, you know.
I'm gonna try again.
Good luck.
I'll come and visit you.
What's your address?
- Via San Martino della Battaglia 14.
- That's where I'll find you, right?
- Even the police couldn't get me out.
- That's the spirit!
Good-bye, and good luck.
- Excuse me, isn't the maid here?
- No, but the lady of the house is.
What are you doing?
I'm working.
This is my room. I live here.
Who said you didn't?
What are you supposed to do here?
A lot of stuff.
Excuse me.
Did the maid go out with the dog?
What dog?
My dog!
I'm not here to keep an eye on the dog.
I'm pregnant. You understand?
Good morning.
- Where's Flike?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.
Don't make me shout.
Where's Flike?
Madam opened the door and he left.
Where were you, you fool?
I kept the door shut, but she kept opening it.
If anything's happened to him,
I'll kill her.
Please hurry.
- What if I run someone over?
- I'll pay the damages. Just hurry.
- How much?
- 200 lire.
- Here.
- I don't have change.
Do you have change for 1,000 lire?
Could you make change for 1,000 lire?
Give me that glass.
- This one?
- Yes.
Fifty lire. 950 is your change.
- There.
- Thank you.
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my dog.
You're number 15.
Excuse me.
Is this where you kill them?
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Fifteen.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye.
Yes?
A mutt with intelligent eyes.
White with brown spots.
- He ran away from home.
- When?
Yesterday, or perhaps the day before.
What do you wish to do?
Do you want the dog or not?
- What if I don't take him?
- Then we'll have to kill him.
- You'll kill him.
- Filippo.
Yes, sir.
Take this gentleman to see the dogs caught in the last two days.
- Come with me.
- Thank you.
Well, what have you decided?
So you'll kill him?
We have to.
What else can we do with them?
- But 450 lire...
- Next.
We caught this one the day before yesterday, that one yesterday.
That one the day before yesterday.
That one ten days ago.
This one yesterday.
And this one the day before.
Watch out for the cart.
See, he's not dead!
Good evening, Mrs. Malantoni.
Good evening, sir.
What do you want from me?
We'll be going to your funeral, not the other way around!
You think I owe you something?
What are you yelling about?
You wretch! Pay your debts.
My debts!
That's not the reason you want to kick me out.
Tomorrow the doorman will kick you out.
There are laws, you know.
I pay my debts.
I worked for the Ministry of Public Works for 30 years!
I've always paid my debts.
Debts!
She doesn't even know what a bill is.
I have seven people to support.
Spare some change, please.
I have seven dependents.
Spare some change.
Thank you.
Battistini.
My dear Ferrari, how are you?
So-so. How about you?
I can't complain. How are things?
- You know. Getting by.
- Excuse me. I'm catching the bus.
I'll take the next one.
My dear Ferrari, how are you?
I'm having a dispute with my landlady.
I'm sure I'm going to win.
I'll get an injunction and stop her.
I'll pay 7,500 lire and I'll stop her.
All I need is half the money.
I have to find 2,000 lire.
- You're still at the same address?
- Yes, I'm not moving from there.
The landlady would like to kick me out right now.
You understand? 2,000 lire is all -
I'm sorry.
I don't want to miss my bus.
Good-bye, Ferrari.
So nice to see you again.
If you see Carloni, give him my regards.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
Thank you.
Ma'am, I have two children.
Thank you.
I have seven dependents.
Be still.
- Flike, what are you doing there?
- Commendatore!
How are you, Commendatore?
I was just wondering what Flike was doing here.
He's playing. He plays all day long.
He's so clever. How adorable.
He's so cute.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
- I can't. My bus is leaving.
- Just a cup of coffee.
- No, thanks. The bus is leaving.
- A drink. Something.
- Really, I'd love to, but I can't.
- At least allow me to walk with you.
- Of course.
- What are you doing these days?
- Nothing.
I'm a pensioner, so I'm just getting by.
I don't do anything.
Lucky you, with nothing to do.
You're late, sir.
Do you think there's going to be a war?
Who knows?
We're leaving.
Good-bye.
- Congratulations once again.
- Congratulations.
Thank you, dear.
- All the best, dear.
- You promised to come visit us.
- I promise.
- Come see how the baby has grown.
All right.
Give the baby a kiss for me.
- All the best.
- Thank you.
- All the best.
- Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't forget tomorrow, and don't be late.
We can't be late.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye.
- Paolo.
- What is it?
What is it, Olga?
My dear.
Careful.
Flike, you naughty boy.
You had us all so worried.
You ran away, didn't you?
Have a piece of cake.
She wants to make one big formal living room.
Mr. Umberto, eat the cake.
What's the matter, Mr. Umberto?
I'm tired.
Of her?
It's a little of everything.
Wherever you go, you'll be happier than you are here.
That's the way it goes.
Go on, eat.
Where's he going?
Leaving already, Mr. Umberto?
Yes.
Where are you going?
I found a place.
Nearby?
Yes.
Then we'll see each other from time to time.
Listen, you need to leave as well.
There are lots of jobs in Rome.
Don't stay here.
She'll kick me out the minute she finds out I'm pregnant.
Can't you go back to your hometown?
My father would beat me.
Will we meet again, Mr. Umberto?
I left a few things in the dresser.
You take them.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Get rid of the one from Florence.
Yes, Mr. Umberto.
I'm sorry, but you can't bring the dog on.
- Before 8:00 you can.
- You telling me the rules?
If it's a hunting dog, you can.
Otherwise, you can't.
I could say I'm going hunting.
For what?
Couldn't I have a gun in my suitcase?
All right.
Where are you getting off?
Via Leccosa.
Go.
- That whistle just keeps blowing.
- I'm so sleepy in the morning.
He's little, but he's mischievous.
- No, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
- If you say so.
- How many dogs do you have?
- About 20. Why?
Do you keep them here all day long?
We have fresh air and space.
I'd like to board my dog here.
Can I see where they sleep?
- They sleep in the house with us.
- Three of them sleep with me.
A blind one, plus two others.
They snuggle up against me all night.
I'm going on a trip.
I'd like to leave him here.
For how long?
A while.
Board is 100 lire a day.
Bread is expensive.
Right?
There are other expenses: tripe, pasta, tomato sauce, because we cook for them.
And besides the food, there's the bleach and everything else.
Tripe is expensive, and so is bleach and sawdust.
And we have to eat, too.
I'd like to leave you 5,000 lire.
Actually, almost 6,000.
Plus this suitcase full of stuff.
When are you coming back?
I don't know. We'll see.
See all this nice stuff?
You know, some people leave their dogs here and never come back.
What do you do then?
I run them off.
What do you expect?
Do you ever walk them?
There's a boy willing to do it, but he wants to be paid.
We keep them here.
We train them, and they get used to it.
No, they don't get used to it.
No. I'm not leaving him here.
Good-bye.
More money and less talk.
You wasted my time.
Daniela!
Mommy!
Hi, honey.
Good boy.
- Hello, Daniela.
- Hello.
Daniela, do you really love Flike?
Really and truly?
Yes.
Then you can have him.
Yes. And you can have the leash, too.
- Miss, this dog is mine.
- What do you mean, yours?
Yes, it's mine.
I'd be very happy if the little girl would take him.
Who will clean up after him?
Dogs are dirty.
Guess who'll end up with the dirty work?
- I'll clean up after him.
- Oh, sure.
No, her mother doesn't want a dog.
Come on. Let's go.
He's never any trouble.
He's as obedient as a child.
- You'll see. She'll be happy.
- Sure, it's a bargain.
But I'm giving him to her for nothing.
A dog like him, for nothing.
Right. And that's why you're getting rid of him.
Come on. Let's go, Daniela.
Walk, you spoiled little brat.
Come on.
Daniela, let's go.
Flike, come here.
Flike, come here.
Flike, look at the pinecone.
Come on. Here, boy.
Come on. Stand up.
Come on.
Come on. Run.
Here it is.
Come on, Flike. Up!
Good boy, Flike.
Run, Flike. Run!
THE END
Now you take it from here, slugger.
Joey?
Joe Doyle!
All right. What do you want?
Hey, I got one of your birds.
I recognized him by the band.
Yeah, must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.
Yeah, he flew into my coop.
Do ya want him?
Well, I gotta watch myself these days.
You know what I mean?
Well, listen, don't worry.
I'll take him up to your loft.
Okay, I'll see you on the roof.
That a boy. That a boy.
Come on, fella. Come on.
That a boy. Come on. Come on.
- Hey.
- Hiya.
How goes?
He's up on the roof.
The pigeon?
Uh, yeah. It worked.
I think somebody fell off the roof.
He thought he was gonna sing to the crime commission. He won't.
- I thought they was gonna talk to him.
- That's the idea.
I thought they was gonna talk to him and get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave 'em an argument.
No, I figured the worst they were gonna do was lean on him a little bit.
Like I said, maybe he gave 'em an argument.
He's been giving Johnny, the boss, a lot of arguments lately.
- He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.
- A canary.
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.
Hey, come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
Well, I'll be in there later, and-
Father Barry is here.
Same thing happened to my Andy five years ago.
- You're Pop Doyle, the boy's father?
- That's right.
Looks like he fell off the roof, or maybe he was pushed.
- Got any ideas?
- No.
He was the only longshoreman that had the guts to talk to them crime investigators.
- Who asked you?
- Everybody knows that.
Shut up. If Joey took my advice, he wouldn't be-
- Everybody knows that.
- I said shut up!
Look, I know how you feel about cops... but maybe if you could give me some leads, I could-
I kept telling him,
"Don't say nothing.
Keep quiet. You'll live longer."
I've been on the docks all my life, boy... and there's one thing I learned:
You don't ask no questions, you don't answer no questions... unless you want to wind up like that.
Edie. Edie, come here.
I want to talk to you.
Come with me.
Father, who'd wanna kill Joey?
Who'd wanna kill Joey?
Stay away from him. Stay away from him!
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!
Edie, Edie listen. Edie, Edie!
Edie, time and faith. Remember, time and faith are great healers.
- Father, my brother's dead, and you talk about time and faith!
- I know.
- My brother was the best kid in the neighborhood, and everybody said so.
- Edie, listen.
I'm in the church if you need me.
You're in the church if I need you?
Did you ever hear of a saint hiding in a church?
I wanna know who killed my brother!
What's the matter with you, punk?
Hey, boss, Packy wants another drink on the cuff.
- Give it to him!
- All right.
Here's your cut on the shape-up.
Eight hundred and ninety-one men, three bucks a head, that's, uh...
Charley, you count them.
Got a banana boat in 46 tomorrow.
If we pull a walkout, might mean a few bucks from the shippers.
- Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
- Ask two Gs.
$2,673.
These clowns can't fight.
There's nobody tough anymore.
- Hiya, slugger.
- Hi there, Johnny.
Hi, kid.
Look out, now!
Don't hit me. Don't hit me!
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?
- Right here, Mr. Friendly.
- Hiya, J.P. How's business?
Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.
He won't take no loans, and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.
- He's my wife's nephew.
- But he won't take no loans!
I gotta put him to work!
She'd murder me!
That's why I never got married.
Here's the interest on the day, boss: $532.
Here, you count it.
Countin' makes me sleepy.
Hey, Skins, you handle that sheet metal all right?
Yeah, it was easy. The new checker faked the receipt. Here it is.
When you talk to me, take the cigar out of your mouth.
- Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Here you are- 45 bills.
Hey, Terry, you count this.
Go on. It's good for you.
It develops your mind.
- What mind?
- Shut up. I like the kid.
Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley, huh?
We won a bundle.
Real tough. Big try.
I lost the count.
Okay. Forget it, Einstein.
How come you never got an education like your brother Charley here?
The only arithmetic he ever got was hearing the referee count up to ten.
You know, you're not too funny today, fat man.
Hey!
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley?
He ain't himself.
It's just the Joey Doyle thing and how he exaggerates the thing.
Just too much Marquis of Queensbury.
- It softens him up.
- Listen, kid, I'm a soft touch too.
Ask any rummy on the dock if I ain't good for a fin... anytime they put the arm on me.
But my old lady raised us ten kids... on a stinkin' watchman's pension.
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.
I didn't work my way up outta there for nothin'.
Look, I know that, Johnny.
I know it.
Takin' over this local took a little doin'.
There was some pretty rough fellas in the way.
They give me this to remember 'em by.
He had to keep his hand over his throat... to stay alive, and he still went after them.
- I know it.
- I know what's eatin' you.
Well, I got 2,000 dues-payin' members in this local.
That's $72,000 a year legitimate.
And when each one puts in a couple of bucks a day... just to make sure the work's steady... well, figure it out.
And that's just for openers.
We got the fattest piers... in the fattest harbor in the world.
Everything moves in and out, we take our cut.
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.
You don't suppose I can afford to be boxed out of a deal like this, do you... a deal I sweated and bled for, on account of one lousy little cheese-eater- that Doyle bum- who thinks he can go squealin' to the crime commission, do ya?
Well, do ya?
Well, no, Johnny.
I just figured I shoulda been told.
I make it $2,623.
You're $50 short, Skins.
Gimme.
I must've miscounted.
Gimme.
Gimme!
You come from Greenpoint- go back to Greenpoint.
You don't work here no more.
Here, kid. Here's half a bill.
Go get your load on.
- No, I'm okay, Johnny. Thanks.
- Go on. A present from your Uncle Johnny.
And Mac... tomorrow mornin' when you shape the men, put Terry up in the loft- number one.
- Sure, why not?
- Every day.
It's nice, easy work, see?
You check in and you goof off on a coffee bag. Okay?
Okay.
Hey.
You got a real friend here.
Now, don't forget it.
Why should he forget it?
Yeah. Thanks, Johnny.
All right. Payday.
Barney.
Mac.
Truck.
Hi, Terry.
- Hiya, kid.
- I was just gonna feed 'em.
I already fed 'em.
You must've been up early, huh?
I was up anyhow, so I figured I might as well.
Boy, they sure got it made, huh?
Eatin', sleepin', flyin' around like crazy... raisin' gobs of squabs.
Well, I better get over there.
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the floor,
'cause I don't want 'em to catch cold.
I'll see you around, huh?
Come on, Tony. Give me them tabs.
He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.
Sure he was.
That's why he got it in the head.
He couldn't learn to keep his mouth shut.
Pop?
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?
- The boys who work today'll be chippin' in gladly.
- That's right, Pop.
No thanks, fellas. I'm gonna shape.
Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?
- Johnny Friendly, that great labor leader.
- That's a good one.
Why don't you keep that big mouth of yours shut?
What are you, a wise guy?
If I was wise,
I wouldn't be no longshoreman for 30 years.
I'm poorer now than when I started.
- Wise guy.
- Big mouth.
- Don't mess with those guys.
- Oh, here.
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
Might come in handy.
- Go ahead. Wear it, Kayo.
- Thanks, Pop.
Mine's more full of holes than the Pittsburgh infield.
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah, yeah.
I got a coat for you.
Say, do you know Terry Malloy?
- No, I don't know him.
- Never heard of him.
Say, you're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
So what?
Didn't I see you fight a couple of years ago?
Without the birdseed- whadda ya want?
Oh, uh, our identification.
"Waterfront Crime Commission."
What's that?
I just want to ask you a few questions.
See, we're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime... and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
- I don't know nothin'.
- You haven't heard the questions yet.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
There's a rumor that you're one of the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.
Well, I don't know nothin'.
- Nobody's accusing you of anything, Mr. Malloy.
- I hope you understand that.
Just want to ask you some questions about some people you may know.
- People I may know?
- That's right.
- You better get outta here, buster.
- Now, slow down, boy, huh?
I don't know nothin', I ain't seen nothin', and I'm not sayin' nothin'.
So why don't you and your girlfriend just take off?
All right, Mr. Malloy.
You have every right not to talk... if that's what you choose to do.
- The public has a right to know the facts too.
- Yeah. All right.
- We'll be seeing you again.
- Never is gonna be too much soon for me, shorty.
Take it easy.
How do you like them mugs, takin' me for a pigeon?
- Who was it?
- I don't know who they are.
You're three weeks behind on the last $25, but I'm willing to take a chance.
Some chance at ten percent a week.
And if we don't borrow, we don't work.
May you rot in hell, J.P.
When I'm dead and gone, you'll know what a friend I was.
Why don't you drop dead now so we can test your theory?
Condolences.
Hey, Pop, look.
All right. Let her go, Tony.
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider with a turned-around collar.
Don't you?
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.
All right. Loften, Malloy...
Hendricks, Prochowski...
- Westerfield, McGryer.
- Three forty-one.
- Three forty-eight.
- Seventy-one.
I've been thinking about your question, and, uh... you're right, Edie.
This is my parish.
I don't know how much I can do, but I'll never find out... unless I come down here and take a good look for myself.
All right, I need some extra banana carriers.
Bananas again. I wonder when we're gonna get a boat from Ireland with some good Irish whiskey on it.
Dugan, my boy, you're dreamin' again.
All right. Kelly.
Richie.
Yeah, you.
What's the matter?
Nobody wanna work today?
Yeah, you.
Yeah, you.
Hey, who do you see to get a day's pay around here?
- Meatballs.
- Definitely.
Come here!
Hey, Terry! Grab that one!
Give me that!
- Give it to me!
- What? What?
Give it to me!
- Give me that!
- What makes you so special?
Things are lookin' up on the docks.
Don't you recognize her, dopey?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.
You give me that!
You Joey Doyle's sister?
Yes, I am.
Yeah.
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.
Well, it's been nice wrestlin' with ya.
Edie.
Pop? Here's your tab. Take it.
All right. Give it to me.
I can use it.
Now get back to the sisters where you belong.
I'm surprised at you, Father, if you don't mind my saying so... lettin' her see things ain't fit for the eyes of a decent girl.
All right, that's all.
Come back tomorrow.
Hey, what do you do now?
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.
I've been standin' here for five straight mornings... and that bum over there looks right through you.
You can't be around here.
Come on. Get outta here.
I'm sorry, Father. I didn't mean it.
- What do you wanna do?
- Come on. Let's go get a bowl.
Wait a minute. Is this all you do- just take it like this?
What about your union?
No other union in the country would stand for a thing like that.
The waterfront's tougher, Father.
Like it ain't part of America.
- You know how a trigger local works, Father?
- No. How?
You get up in a meetin', you make a motion... the lights go out, then you go out.
That's how it's been ever since Johnny and his cowboys took over the local.
Name one place where it's safe to even talk without gettin' clobbered.
The church.
What?
The bottom of the church.
You know what you're lettin' yourself in for?
- You got a cigarette on you?
- Yeah.
Right over there.
Hey.
- You working hard?
- Yeah.
You wouldn't mind working once in a while... just to justify this lofty position, would you?
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.
We have an extra detail for you- that's if you don't mind... being disturbed or anything.
The priest and this Doyle girl are gettin' a meeting together down at the church... and we, uh- we want a rundown on it- you know, the names and the numbers of all the players.
Wait a minute.
All right. You're nominated.
Well, why me, Charley?
I feel funny goin' down there.
- Besides, I'd just be stoolin' for you.
- Let me tell you what stooling is.
Stooling is when you rat on your friends, the guys you're with.
- Yeah.
- But if Johnny wants a favor... don't think about it- do it.
Now, go on. Join the congregation.
Well, I thought there'd be more of you here, but-
The- The Romans found out what a handful could do... if it's the right handful.
I'm just a potato-eater, but... isn't it simple as one, two, three?
One: The working conditions are bad.
Two: They're bad because the mob does the hiring.
And three: The only way we can break the mob... is to stop letting them get away with murder.
Now, if one of you would just answer one question...
we'd have a start, a very good start.
And that question is... who killed Joey Doyle?
Not one of you has a line on who killed Joey Doyle?
I have a hunch all of you could tell us something about it.
All right, then answer this one:
How can we call ourselves Christians...
and protect these murderers with our silence?
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.
How can you just sit there and not say anything?
And I'll always think of him as my best friend.
- But what do you want me to-
- Who asked him in here?
I'm just trying to find out what happened to Joey Doyle.
- Maybe you can be helpful.
- "Helpful"?
The brother of Charley the Gent?
They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Better leave Charley outta this.
You don't think he'd be "helpful"?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Maybe I will one of these days.
"One of these days."
Now, listen. You know who the pistols are.
You going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?
Are you?
Hey, Dugan, how about you?
One thing you gotta understand, Father:
On the dock we've always been D and D.
- "D and D"-- what's that?
- Deaf and dumb.
No matter how much we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.
"Rat"? Now, boys, get smart.
I know you're gettin' pushed around, but... there's one thing we've got in this country, and that's ways of fightin' back.
Now, getting the facts to the public, testifying for what you know is right...
against what you know is wrong.
And what's ratting to them is telling the truth for you.
Can't you see that?
Can't you see that?
It seems to me we've gone just about as far as we can at this time.
I think you'll agree with that, Father.
So I'd like to close with a few words from St. Matthew.
"Come unto me, all ye-"
What did I tell you, sticking your neck out?
This is a police problem, not ours!
- These people need our help, Vince.
- Okay! Okay!
Only don't blame me when they ship you off to Abyssinia.
I won't.
You'd better go home in pairs.
Two's is two, you know.
Come on!
- Pop! Pop!
- Come here. Don't go out there.
No, no. Come here.
Edie! Edie!
What happened to Pop?
He's an old man. They won't hurt him.
Get out, you!
Here, talk to me.
Are you all right, Dugan?
Yeah, considerin' they were usin' my head for a baseball.
Are you still D and D?
You still call it ratting?
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?
If I stick my neck out and they chop it off, would that be the end of it...
- or are you willing to go all the way?
- Down the line.
They'll put the muscle on you too... turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Here, wipe your face. Listen to me.
You stand up, and I'll stand up with you.
- Right down the wire?
- So help me God.
I think we're okay.
Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Well, they play pretty rough around here.
Well, I can make it home now all right.
Okay.
Which side are you with?
Me? I'm with me. Terry.
Hey, you got a dime for a cup of coffee?
Beat it, will ya?
Just a little dime you don't need?
Hey, I know you.
You're Edie Doyle.
- Come on, beat it.
- Your brother was a saint.
He's the only one who ever tried to get me compensation.
What are you doin'?
Get outta here, will ya?
You remember, Terry.
You was there that night-
- Get outta here.
- You remember.
Get outta here!
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.
You don't buy me.
You're still a bum.
So long, Edie.
Lord have mercy on Joey.
Who's callin' me a bum?
Everybody loved Joey.
From little kids to the old rummies.
Did you know him very well?
Well, you know, he got around.
- What did that man mean just now?
- Don't pay no attention to him.
He's drunk, he's falling down, everything.
He's just a juicehead that hangs around the neighborhood.
Don't pay no attention.
I'd better go now.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna bite ya.
I guess they don't let you walk with fellas where you've been, huh?
You know how the sisters are.
Yeah. Are you training to be a nun?
It's just a regular college.
Wait a second.
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.
Where is that?
It's in Tarrytown.
- Where is that?
- In the country.
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.
So how often do you get in here?
I guess I haven't been here since last Christmas.
We were gonna have a Thanksgiving party.
That's nice.
What do you do up there?
Just- What? Study?
I want to be a teacher.
A teacher? That's very good. You know-
Personally, I admire brains.
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.
He done a couple of years of college.
It isn't just brains.
It's- It's how you use them.
Yeah, I get your thought.
You know, I've seen you a lot of times before.
Remember parochial school on Pulaski Street?
Seven, eight years ago?
Your hair- Had your hair, uh-
Braids. That's right.
Looked like a hunk of rope.
You had wires on your teeth, and... glasses, everything.
You was really a mess.
I can get home all right now, thanks.
Hey, listen, don't get sore.
I'm just kiddin' you a little bit.
I just mean to tell you that you... grew up very nice.
Thanks.
You don't-
You don't remember me, do you?
I remembered you the first moment I saw you.
By the nose, huh?
Well, some people just got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Now you got me.
Boy, the way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.
They thought they was gonna beat an education into me, but I foxed 'em.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you have done it?
With a little more patience and kindness.
That's what makes people mean and difficult:
People don't care enough about them.
What, are you kiddin' me?
Come on. I'd better get you home.
There's too many guys around here with only one thing on their mind.
Am I gonna see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
- I really don't know.
- Come on.
Come on.
All right. You're all packed.
Here's your bus ticket, and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.
- I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.
- Edie, for years your mom and me... put quarters into the cookie jar... to keep you up there with the sisters... keep you from things like I just seen outside the window.
A daughter of mine walkin' arm in arm with Terry Malloy.
- You know who Terry Malloy is?
- Who is he, Pop?
He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...
who is Johnny Friendly's right hand, and a butcher in a camel-hair coat.
You tryin' to tell me Terry is too?
He tries to act tough... but there's a look in his eye.
Yeah, a look in his eye.
Hold your hats, brothers.
Here we go again.
Do you think he's one of them cases you're always... draggin' into the house and feelin' sorry for... like that litter of kittens you brought in?
The only one you wanted to keep... had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.
Look at him, the little bum.
He said he wants to see me again.
Look.
See this arm?
Two inches longer than the other.
That's from years of workin'... and sweatin' and liftin'... and swingin' a hook.
Every time I hoist a box or a coffee bag...
I says to meself, "That's for Edie... so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent."
Oh, Pop!
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.
Pop...
I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful for everything you've done- for giving me the education, for keeping me away from all of this.
But Pop, I've seen things that I know are so wrong.
How can I got back to school and keep my mind on things that are just in books?
That- That aren't people living?
I'm gonna stay, Pop... and I'm gonna keep on trying to find out who is guilty for Joey.
Heads up!
Hi.
What are you doin' up here on the roof?
Just looking.
Take a look at the champion flock of the neighborhood.
Fly pretty nice, huh?
"Golden Warriors"?
Yeah. I started the Golden Warriors.
You might say that I was the original Golden Warrior.
Hey. This bum here is my shadow.
He thinks I'm a tough man
'cause I boxed pro for a while.
Think you're a tough guy, huh?
- Joey used to raise pigeons.
- Get outta here.
Joey used to raise pigeons.
Yeah, he had a few birds.
I've been takin' care of 'em.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
I just go for it.
You know this city is full of hawks?
That's a fact.
They hang around on top of the big hotels... and they spot a pigeon in the park-
Right down on 'em.
You got a second? One second?
I wanna show you something.
Here you are.
What do you think of that fella?
She's a beauty.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
Oh, look what he went and did.
He's my lead bird.
He's always on top of the perch.
If another bum tries to come along and take his place, he really lets him have it.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Well, one thing about 'em, though:
They're very faithful.
- They get married just like people.
- Better.
And they stay that way till one of 'em dies.
That's nice.
Hey, go ahead. Fix the roof.
Here. You want that egg?
Thanks.
Do you like beer?
I don't know.
I'll bet you never had a glass of beer.
- You ever have a glass of beer?
- No.
Wanna have one with me?
In a saloon?
Well, yeah.
I mean, I know a nice little dump down there that... got a special entrance for ladies, and all like that.
Come on. It won't hurt.
Come on.
Yeah? Good.
- Hey, Mac?
- Yeah.
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.
Yeah. See the fight last night?
- No.
- Kid named Riley. Both hands.
Like you used to do.
I hope he got better dice than me.
Comedian.
Are you really a prizefighter?
I used to be.
How did you get interested in that?
Well, I don't know.
I had to scrap all my life.
I might as well get paid for it.
When I was a kid, my old man got bumped off, and- and, uh- never mind how.
And they stuck Charley and me in a- a dump they call a children's home.
Oh, boy, that was some home.
Well, anyhow, I ran away from there... and I fought in the club smokers and peddled papers... and Johnny Friendly bought a piece of me.
Bought a piece of you?
Yes.
Then, uh, I was goin' pretty good there for a while.
And after that, uh-
Well, I don't know.
What do you really care?
Am I right?
Shouldn't everybody care about everybody else?
Oh, what a fruitcake you are.
I mean, isn't everybody a part of everybody else?
And you really believe that drool?
Yes, I do.
Well, here we are.
One for the lady and for the gent.
Here's to the first one.
I hope it ain't the last.
Tink.
Go ahead.
Good?
No, not like that. One hump.
Hey, you wanna hear my philosophy of life?
Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met anyone like you.
There's not a- a spark... of sentiment or romance... or human kindness in your whole body.
What good does it do you besides get you in trouble?
And when things and people get in your way... you just knock them aside, get rid of them- is that your idea?
Listen, don't look at me when you say that.
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.
Fixin' him wasn't my idea.
Who said it was?
Well, everybody's puttin' the needle on me- you and them mugs in the church and Father Barry.
I didn't like the way he was lookin' at me.
He was looking at everybody the same way.
Oh, yeah?
Anyhow, what's with this Father Barry?
What's his racket?
- His racket?
- Yeah, his racket. Everybody's got a racket.
But he's a priest.
Are you kiddin'? So what?
That don't make no difference.
You don't believe anybody, do you?
Listen, down here it's every man for himself.
It's keepin' alive.
It's standin' in with the right people so you get a little bit of change jinglin' in your pocket.
- And if you don't?
- If you don't- right down.
It's living like an animal.
All right, then. I'd rather live like an animal than end up like-
Like Joey?
Are you afraid to mention his name?
No.
Well, what do you keep harpin' on that for?
Come on, drink up.
You gotta get a little fun outta life.
Come on. I'll stick some music on.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?
Help me if you can, for God sakes.
Edie, I'd like to help.
I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do.
All right.
I shouldn't have asked you.
Here, come on. Have a little beer.
Come on, come on.
I don't want it.
You just stay here and finish your drink.
Oh, no, no. Listen, don't go.
I got my whole life to drink.
Are you sore at me?
What for?
Well, I don't know.
For not-
For not bein' no help to you.
You would if you could.
Here I come!
Pick a winner.
Wait a minute.
First I gotta kiss the bride.
Come on, you kissed her before.
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?
- What's goin' on here?
- Gimme a cigarette.
You gotta stop smokin' so much.
Come on. We can get out through here.
What's the matter with you?
- Come on.
- That's a pretty tune.
Here's a stick of gum.
It'll do you good.
- Thank you.
- Do you like that music?
If I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but-
Come on. You wanna- you wanna spin?
Come on. Don't be afraid.
You dance divinely.
Say, we're doing pretty good.
The sisters ought to see you now.
Wait a minute.
I feel like I'm just floating.
Just floating.
Just floating.
Hey!
I been lookin' all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.
Right now?
Yeah, he just got a call from Mr. Upstairs.
Something's gone wrong.
He's plenty hot.
- I wanna take her home first.
- I wouldn't. I'll see the little lady home.
Just tell him I'll come over there when I'm ready.
Hey, Ed, wait up!
Who was that?
I don't know. Some mug.
Who was he?
Edie, you gotta quit tryin' to find out about Joey. It ain't safe.
Now, I'm telling you, it ain't safe.
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.
Excuse me, miss. You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
- A what?
- Be at the statehouse, courtroom nine...
What's the matter? I told you,
I don't know nothin' about that.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.
You're privileged under the Constitution... to protect yourself against questions which might implicate you in any crimes.
Listen, you know what they're askin' me to do?
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy, is tell the truth.
Good night, kid.
Nice wedding.
What are you gonna do?
I ain't gonna eat cheese for no cops, and that's for sure!
It was Johnny Friendly who had Joey killed, wasn't it?
Or he had him killed.
He had something to do with it, didn't he?
He and your big brother, Charley?
You can't tell me, can you, because you're a part of it.
Because you're just as bad as the worst of them.
Tell me the truth, Terry.
You'd better go back to that school out in daisyland.
You're drivin' yourself nuts.
You're drivin' me nuts.
Quit worryin' about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.
I should have known you wouldn't tell me.
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
Well, I think he still owns you.
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Don't say that to me, Edie.
Don't say that to me now.
No wonder. No wonder.
I'm only tryin' to help you out.
I'm tryin' to keep you from gettin' hurt.
What more do you want me to do?
- Much more.
- Wait a minute.
Much, much, much more.
Where are you goin'?
- Hi there, Johnny. I was just-
- Genius!
I was just comin' over there.
- Where were you? Chicago?
- No, I was on my way over there.
How many times you been knocked out, Terry?
- Knocked out? Uh, two times.
- That's once too often.
Your brains must be rattling.
What do you got up there? Chinese bells?
- What's the matter?
- I thought you were gonna keep your eye on that church meeting.
I was there. There was nothin' happenin'.
"Nothin' happenin'," he says.
Some operator you got yourself there.
One more like him, we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
I'm tellin' you, it was a big nothin'.
The priest did all the talkin'.
- He did?
- Yeah.
Half an hour later, a certain Timothy J. Dugan... had a secret session with the crime commission, and he done all the talkin'.
Well, Dugan- what does he know?
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all!
- Where'd you get that?
- I got it.
He got it. It's the complete works of Timothy J. Dugan.
- I knew he had the guts, but I never-
- "Guts"?
Why, that crummy pigeon!
He oughta have his neck wrung.
That's what we get for getting mixed up with this punch-drunk brother of yours.
He was all right hangin' around for laughs, but this is business.
- I don't like anyone goofin' off on my business.
- I wasn't goofin', Johnny.
What are you goin' around with his sister for?
- I'm not goin'--
- Just shut up!
Look, Johnny, it's just that... the Doyle broad, she's got him so he doesn't know where his feet is anymore.
- It's an unhealthy relationship!
- Definitely.
Get rid of her, unless you're both tired of living.
- You got her address?
- Yeah.
Look, we gotta do something to muzzle this Dugan, or he'll raise... the biggest stink this town has ever seen.
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.
The time to use it is now... pronto, if not sooner.
You know where you're goin'?
Back in the hold.
No more cushy job in the loft.
It's down in the hold with the sweat gang... till you learn your lesson, see?
You!
Let's go.
Wise up!
At last, an Irish shipment.
And loaded to the gunnels with fine Irish whiskey.
- See, Kayo? The good Lord takes care of his own in time.
- That he does.
Come on there, Kayo! Get it up!
- All right. Take it up.
- Take it up.
Take it away.
And don't go walkin' off with any of that!
You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage!
All right, all right.
Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Kayo, let me see you a minute afterwards.
What are you down here for? To see we don't steal any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?
- I want to talk-
- Get away from me, will ya?
- All right. Take it up.
- Take it up.
Take it away.
Okay.
Kayo, you're a walkin' distillery!
Watch it!
Get a doctor!
He don't need a doctor.
He needs a priest.
I came down here to keep a promise.
I gave Kayo my word that if he stood up to the mob...
I'd stand up with him... all the way.
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.
He was one of those fellows who had the gift for standin' up.
But this time they fixed him.
Oh, they fixed him for good this time.
Unless it was an accident, like Big Mac says.
Some people think the crucifixion only took place on Calvary.
Well, they'd better wise up.
Takin' Joey Doyle's life to stop him from testifying is a crucifixion.
And droppin' a sling on Kayo Dugan... because he was ready to spill his guts tomorrow- that's a crucifixion!
And every time the mob puts the pressure on a good man...
tries to stop him from doing his duty as a citizen... it's a crucifixion!
And anybody who sits around and lets it happen...
keeps silent about something he knows has happened... shares the guilt of it just as much as the Roman soldier... who pierced the flesh of our Lord to see if he was dead.
Go back to your church, Father!
Boys, this is my church!
And if you don't think Christ is down here on the waterfront, you've got another guess comin'!
Get off the dock, Father!
Tillio, don't do that.
- Whose side you on, boy?
- Let him finish.
Every morning... when the hiring boss blows his whistle...
Jesus stands alongside you in the shape-up.
He sees why some of you get picked and some of you get passed over.
He sees the family men worryin' about gettin' the rent...
and gettin' food in the house for the wife and the kids.
He sees you sellin' your souls to the mob for a day's pay!
The next bum that throws somethin' deals with me!
I don't care if he's twice my size!
Now, what does Christ think of the easy-money boys... who do none of the work and take all of the gravy?
And how does he feel about the fellas who wear $150 suits...
and diamond rings on your union dues... and your kickback money?
And how does he... who spoke up without fear against every evil... feel about your silence?
Shut up about that!
Just watch this.
Did you see that?
You want to know what's wrong with our waterfront?
It's the love of a lousy buck.
It's makin' love of a buck, the cushy job...
more important than the love of man.
It's forgettin' that every fella down here is your brother in Christ.
But remember: Christ is always with you.
Christ is in the shape-up, he's in the hatch, he's in the union.
He's kneelin' right here beside Dugan... and he's sayin' with all of you...
"If you do it to the least of mine, you do it to me."
And what they did to Joey and what they did to Dugan, they're doing to you.
And you, you. All of you!
And only you- only you, with God's help- have the power to knock 'em out for good.
Okay, Kayo?
Amen.
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!
Break it up. Lets go to work.
Edie, Joey's jacket.
I'm sure Kayo would wish you to have it back.
Terry?
Terry?
I brought you Joey's jacket.
Yours is coming apart.
Pigeons.
Yeah, they're nervous.
There was a hawk around here before.
Edie-
Father, I wanna speak to you a minute.
Remember what you said about Kayo Dugan... about keeping your mouth shut when you know the score?
I don't want to hear your confession.
I'll dig it out for myself... and I'll use it where it'll do the most good.
Now, you take your turn.
Father Gregory will hear you.
I don't wanna talk-
Wait a second, will ya?
Wait a minute.
I just wanna talk to you one second.
Listen to me. You gotta listen to me.
Wait a minute.
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up for the knock-off.
Come on. Take a walk with me, kid, and give it to me straight.
There's nothing I haven't heard.
Come on.
It started out as a favor.
"A favor"-- who am I kidding?
It's "do it or else."
But believe me when I tell you I just thought they was gonna lean on him a little bit.
I never figured they was gonna knock him off.
And I tried to tell Edie the other night.
I really tried to.
I wanted to tell her. She's the first nice thing that ever happened to me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- What do you mean? About telling her?
- Yes, about telling her... the commission, your subpoena.
- I know you got a subpoena.
- Well, I don't know.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
It's a question of who rides who.
But, you know, if I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel.
And how much is your soul worth if you don't?
They're askin' me to put the finger on my own brother.
Johnny Friendly used to take me to ball games when I was a kid.
"Ball games." Don't break my heart.
I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds.
So you've got a brother?
Let me tell you something:
You've got some other brothers.
And they're gettin' the short end... while your Johnny's getting mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds.
Ball games! Listen.
If I were you, I would walk right-
Never mind.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
"Conscience."
That stuff- That stuff can drive you nuts.
Good luck.
Hey, is that all you got to say?
Come here.
Edie called me this morning.
She's coming here to talk to me.
Come on. Why don't you tell her?
No curves.
Okay.
Thanks.
- You?
- Honest to God, Edie-
You gotta believe me. I swear to God, Edie.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here.
That joker from the crime commissioner's office.
Suppose I knew a guy that knocked somebody off.
Think I oughta turn him in?
You mean call a cop?
Are you kiddin'?
You don't think I oughta turn him in?
You was a Golden Warrior once.
That's right.
You started the gang.
You lookin' for me?
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.
On the next investigation we get into,
I hope it's got buildings with elevators.
So far this one's just been climbing stairs.
What are you climbin' 'em for?
Well, it's worth it if we can tell the waterfront story... the way the people have a right to hear it.
Don't you think?
Say, uh, didn't I see you in the Garden... three or four years ago with a fellow named Wilson?
Yeah.
Thought you were gonna take him that night.
Man, he really dumped you.
He dumped me, huh?
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?
Yeah. Yeah, I could see he was hurt.
Hey, what do you think I was doin' with them combinations? Pettin' him?
You just couldn't finish him off, huh?
Hey, don't monkey around there.
- Why didn't you finish him off?
- What do you talk about, "finish him off"?
I was doin' a favor for a couple of pals of mine.
"Favor"?
- That's the way it was.
- That's the way it was.
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.
- I was ready that night.
- You sure looked it.
That's when I figured it was all over.
It was all over, except for the lousy bet.
- My own-
- Yeah?
Well, I guess I better get going.
Hit those stairs again.
Say, was that a hook or an uppercut you caught him with that first time?
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.
- Looked like a hook to me.
- I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.
You know what I mean?
So I let him tag me with the left hand for a couple of rounds.
So just when he starts- he thinks he's getting cute...
I step inside and jab him with a left, with a right, with a left.
I had him in my arms, and from there on in, we were just dancin'.
- I see.
- And that's a fact!
When those guys wanna win a bet, there's nothin' they won't stop at.
I didn't hear 'em, boss, but I sure seen 'em nose to nose like a pair of lovers.
The flatfoot was eatin' it up.
Look, so they been seen together nose to nose, and he smiled at her.
That doesn't mean he's gonna talk.
There is no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.
That's what we always kept you around here for.
How do we keep him from giving this testimony?
Ain't that what you call the main order of business?
He's a good kid. And you know that.
He's a bum. After all the days I gave him in the loft, he's got no gratitude.
- You shut up!
- Mac...
I'm conducting this investigation.
Look... this girl and the father, they got their hooks in the kid so deep... he doesn't even know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition.
All I wanna know is, is he D and D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do?
Look, it's simple.
Drive him out to this place we've been usin'.
Try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.
Johnny, you can't do that.
I mean, maybe the boy is out of line, but he's just a confused kid.
"Confused kid"?
First he crosses me in public and gets away with it, then the next joker.
Pretty soon I'm just another fellow around here!
Johnny, I can't do that.
Then don't.
- Who do you like in the third?
- Gotta be New Hope.
Definitely.
Johnny... he's my kid brother.
That's for you to figure out.
You can have it your way, or you can have it his way.
But you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?
Definitely.
Okay, on your horse... deep thinker.
- Hi, Charley.
- Hello.
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I been wantin' to talk to you.
- Yeah, sure, kid.
- Where to?
Just go to River Street, and I'll tell you where to stop.
- I thought we was goin' to the Garden.
- We are... but I want to cover a bet on the way over.
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.
Well, nobody ever stopped you from talkin', Charley.
Listen, I, uh- The-
The grapevine says that you got a subpoena.
Yeah.
The guys would know you well enough to know that you're not a cheese-eater... but they think maybe you should not be on the outside so much.
A little on the inside. Have a few little things workin' for you down at the docks.
A steady job, a couple extra potatoes- that's all I want.
Oh, sure, that's great when you're a kid, but you're gettin' on.
You're pushin' 30, slugger.
It's time to think about gettin' some ambition.
Well, I always figured I'd live a little bit longer without it.
Maybe.
Look... there's a boss loader slot that's open... on the new pier we're openin' up.
You see, now, it pays six cents... on every hundred pounds that goes in and every hundred pounds that goes out... and you don't have to lift a finger.
That's two, three, four hundred dollars a week.
Four hundred dollars a week just for the openers.
I get all that dough for not doin' nothin'?
You don't do anything, and you don't say anything.
You understand?
There's more to this than I thought, Charley.
I'm tellin' you, there's a lot more.
You don't mean you're thinkin' of testifyin' against some people that we might know?
I don't know, Charley.
I'm tellin' you I don't know, Charley.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.
Listen, you know how much those piers are worth that we control through the local?
- I know that.
- All right. You think Johnny's gonna jeopardize the whole setup...
- for one rubber-lipped ex-tanker who's walking on his heels?
- Don't say that.
- What the-
- I coulda been better.
- That's not the point.
- I coulda been a lot better.
The point is we don't have much time.
I'm tellin' you,
I haven't made up my mind yet.
Well, make up your mind before we get to 437 River Street!
Before we get to where, Charley?
- Before we get to where?
- Listen to me.
Take the job. Just take it.
No questions. Take it.
Charley.
Terry, take this job, please.
Charley.
Please take it.
Charley.
Oh, Charley.
Look, kid, I-
Look, kid, I-
How much you weigh, slugger?
When you weighed 168 pounds...
you were beautiful.
You coulda been another Billy Conn.
And that skunk we got you for a manager... he brought you along too fast.
It wasn't him, Charley. It was you.
You remember that night in the Garden you came down to my dressin' room... and said, "Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson"?
You remember that?
"This ain't your night."
My night! I coulda taken Wilson apart.
So what happens?
He gets the title shot outdoors in a ballpark... and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville.
You was my brother, Charley.
You shoulda looked out for me a little bit.
You shoulda taken care of me just a little bit... so I wouldn't have to take dives for the short-end money.
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.
You don't understand. I coulda had class.
I coulda been a contender.
I coulda been somebody... instead of a bum... which is what I am, let's face it.
It was you, Charley.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll tell him...
I couldn't find you.
Ten to one he won't believe it.
Here.
You take this.
You're gonna need it.
You, you pull over.
Take me to the Garden.
Edie?
Edie?
Stay away from me!
Edie?
Come on. Pease open the door. Please.
Stop it!
I want you to stay away from me!
I know what you want me to do, but I ain't gonna do it, so forget it!
I don't want you to do anything.
You let your conscience tell you what to do.
Shut up about that conscience.
That's all I been hearin'!
- I never mentioned the word before. You just stay away from me!
- Edie!
Edie, you love me.
- I want you-
- I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me!
- I want you to say it to me.
- Stay away from me!
Terry.
Terry.
Hey, Terry!
Hey, Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see ya!
Charley.
Hey, Terry.
Hey, Terry!
Your brother's down here.
Come on down here.
He wants to see ya.
Terry! Come on down!
- What is it, Terry?
- Charley- I think he's in trouble.
Be careful!
Charley.
Terry?
Come on, Terry.
Your brother's down here!
Do you hear what I hear?
Terry! Terry!
Terry!
That's the same way they called Andy the night I lost him.
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!
Terry!
Terry!
Edie! Watch out for the truck!
Terry.
They got Charley.
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.
First Joey, and then Dugan, and now Charley, and then-
Please, Terry, someplace where we can live in peace.
I'm gonna take it out of their skulls.
Charley...
I'm gonna take it out of their skulls.
Please, Terry. They'll kill you too.
Go get the Father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.
And then come on back here and stay with him till he gets here.
Terry, please don't do anything.
Please! Terry!
And for God sakes, don't leave him alone here long.
- Please, Terry.
- Do what I tell you.
Terry!
Where's John Friendly?
He's not here now.
Oh, yeah?
Gimme a shot.
- Take it easy, Terry.
- Don't give me no advice.
Give me the shot.
Look, kid, why don't you go home before Big John gets here?
Just gimme the whiskey.
- Go away.
- Stick around, Tillio.
Go ahead, sit down.
Get outta that phone booth!
Stay where you are, Tillio!
- I want to see ya, Terry.
- I'm right in front of ya.
Now, don't give me a hard time, Terry.
What do you want?
- Your gun.
- Go and chase yourself.
- Come on. Give me the gun.
- You go to hell.
- What did you say?
- Go to hell.
- Sorry. Let me help you up there.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Now what am I gonna do?
- You want to be brave?
Firing lead into another man isn't being brave!
Why don't you mind your own business?
- Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't being brave!
- It's none of your business!
You want to hurt Johnny Friendly?
You want to hurt him?
You want to fix him?
Do you? Do you really want to finish him?
- What do you think?
- For what he did to Charley and a dozen other men better than Charley?
Then don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle... because that's just what he wants!
He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense.
You'll fight him in the courtroom tomorrow with the truth... as you know the truth.
Now, you get rid of that gun, unless you haven't got the guts.
And if you haven't, then you better hold on to it.
Gimme a beer.
Want a beer? Make it two.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in...
$65,500 every year...
and keeps no financial records?
- Oh, sure. We got records.
- Well, where are they?
Well, you see, we was robbed last night, and we can't find no books.
You know you're under oath.
Oh, sure.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals... were broken into last night... and the only item missing from all of them was the financial records?
What do you mean, "odd"?
Like I told you, we was robbed.
That's all for now.
Call the next witness.
Before you call the next witness... are all the officers of Local 374 present this morning?
Call the roll.
Will the following please rise as the names are called?
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, also known as Johnny Friendly, president.
Mr. Louis O. Janotta, vice president.
Daniel D. Coogan, financial secretary.
Mr. Vladin Sokolivitch, delegate.
Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, delegate-
Recordin' secretary.
- Yeah, recordin' secretary.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Next witness.
- Mr. Malloy.
Raise your right hand.
- Name, please.
- Terry Malloy.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- Right.
- "I do."
- I do.
- Be seated, please.
Mr. Malloy, is it true that the night
Joey Doyle was found dead... you were the last one to see him before he was pushed from the roof?
- Yes, that's right.
- And is it true that you went immediately-
Wait. Except for the guys that pushed him off.
And is it true that you went immediately to the Friendly bar... and there expressed your feelings about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?
John Friendly. Right.
And now, Mr. Malloy, can you tell me...
whether Mr. Friendly- or I should say Mr. Skelly-
said anything to you to indicate his responsibility...
in getting rid of Joey Doyle?
- Right.
- And would you say, Mr. Malloy...
that Mr. Friendly made it very clear to you...
that it was absolutely necessary that he murder Joey Doyle...
- in order to maintain his control...
- Turn that thing off.
of the docks and the waterfront locals?
Is that correct?
Would there be anything else, sir?
Yes, Sidney. If Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.
- Anytime today?
- If he calls ever, I'm out!
Very well, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.
You've done more than break the Joey Doyle case.
You've begun to make it possible for honest men to work the docks...
with job security and peace of mind.
You may step down now.
That's all for now.
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.
You just dug your own grave.
Go fall in it.
You're dead on this waterfront and every waterfront from Boston to New Orleans.
You don't drive a truck or a cab.
You don't push a baggage rack.
You don't work no place.
You're done!
Get your hands off me!
Let go!
Come on, will you quit followin' me?
Why don't you get off my tail?
- Orders.
- You're hot. You oughta be glad we're followin' you.
You're makin' me feel like a canary.
- Well?
- Lay off.
Hiya, Chickie.
Who's your friend?
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.
No.
Well, anyway, it's all over.
My friends don't wanna talk to me.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry-
I'll see you later.
Hiya, champ. How's the kid?
A pigeon for a pigeon!
Terry?
The kid.
Tommy?
What'd he have to do that for?
Every one of 'em.
Terry, there's no place that's safe for you now on the waterfront.
Maybe inland, out west someplace.
A farm.
- "A farm"?
- You could do lots of things...
anything, as long as you're away from Johnny Friendly.
And even the longshoremen-
You try to help them, and they just turn their backs...
and stick to their stupid D and D.
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?
You're not even listening to me, are you?
You're going down there.
Just because John Friendly warned you not to, you're going down there.
You think you've got to prove something to them, that you're not afraid of them or something.
Well, go ahead! Get it over with!
Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed!
You stupid, pigheaded-
What are you trying to prove?
They always said I was a bum.
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt nobody.
I'm just gonna go down there... and get my rights.
Okay.
All right! Everybody works today!
Lofgang...
Hendricks...
Prochowski...
Horton...
Dalton, Flaherty, Kaufman-
- What do you think, boys?
- That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.
Stop breathin' that clam sauce on me.
What's doin'?
I wish you'd let me go to work on that cheese-eater.
I'd top the bum off lovely.
Wait till we get off this front page.
Then he's mine.
I want him.
You hear that? He's mine.
Where're them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're gonna need 'em.
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.
Hey, Speck, bring me the first man you see.
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
Here's your man, Mac.
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.
All right. That's it.
I hope that bum comes down here.
I love if he comes down here.
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan law?
They'll be down on us for the slightest infraction- anything!
I'm gonna be indicted any minute!
Come on, now. Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Will you get it through your heads?
They're dustin' off a hot seat for me!
We're a law-abidin' union.
Understand?
He'll kill him.
Hey, Friendly!
John Friendly, come outta there!
Friendly!
Come on outta there!
You wanna know the trouble with you?
You think it makes you a big man if you give the answers.
At the right time, I'll catch up with you.
Be thinkin' about that.
- Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
- Wait a minute, you!
You take them heaters away from you, and you're nothin'! You know that?
You'll talk yourself in the river!
You take the good goods away, and the kickbacks... and the shake-down cabbage, and them pistoleros, and you're nothin'!
Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger, you know that?
- You ratted on us, Terry!
- From where you stand, maybe... but I'm standin' over here now!
- I was rattin' on myself all them years- I didn't even know it.
- Come on!
You give it to Joey, you give it to Dugan... you give it to Charley, who was one of your own.
- You think you're God Almighty, but you know what you are?
- Come on.
You're a cheap, lousy... dirty, stinkin' mug... and I'm glad what I done to you!
You hear that? I'm glad what I done!
- And I'm gonna keep on doin' it till I get-
- Come on! Come on!
Come on!
That boy fights like he used to.
Truck!
- They'll kill him.
- It's a massacre.
He's one of theirs anyway.
Get him! Get him!
What are we waitin' for? Let's go.
That's enough.
Just let him lay there.
What happened?
What happened?
Jimmy, what happened?
Where ya goin'?
Let me by.
You want him?
You can have him!
The little rat's yours.
- Get some fresh water!
- Terry?
Terry.
Terry, listen.
Who's in charge here?
Yours truly's in charge here. Look out.
We gotta get this ship outta here.
It's costing us money.
Blow your whistle.
All right, you guys! Get to work!
Come on!
- What goes?
- I'll have 'em workin' in two minutes.
- Come on, you guys! Get goin'!
- He'd better get these men to work.
Go on down!
Come on, you guys. On the double.
Get to work. You heard me.
Come on. Get in there.
Get in there!
- How about Terry?
- He don't work, we don't work!
Work? He can't even walk!
You wanna know who works?
The ones I pick to work! Now, get goin'.
Come on. All of you, get in there.
Come on, get to work. All of you.
Come on, get up here!
Come on, Pop. On the double.
You work today.
All my life ya pushed me around.
Oh, come on!
How do ya like it?
How do ya like it?
Come on! You walk in, and we'll-
If Terry walks in, we walk in with him.
- They're waitin' for him to walk in!
- Jimmy-
Water.
Did you hear that, Terry? Terry?
- Terry, did you hear that?
- Yeah.
You lost the battle, but... you have a chance to win the war.
- What do I have to do?
- Walk.
- Father-
- Can you walk?
- Walk?
- Yes, walk.
To the pier, I mean.
- And we'll walk in with you.
- So the shippers can see...
we'll take no more orders from Johnny Friendly.
Then it'll give us back our union, so we can run it on the up-and-up.
Johnny Friendly's layin' odds that you won't get up.
What are you standin' around for?
Come on and help me!
Come on, you guys!
Put me on my feet.
Come on.
Take your hands off.
How you doin', pal?
Am I on my feet?
You're on your feet.
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- Terry?
You can.
Just finish what you started.
You can.
Okay.
Okay.
Gimme my hook.
- What are you trying to do?
- He's got to.
Take your hands off. Keep 'em off.
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone!
All right, let's go to work!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Come back here!
Come on, you guys!
Where you guys goin'?
Wait a minute! I'll remember this!
I'll remember every one of ya!
I'll be back!
Don't you forget that!
I'll be back!
Looking for something?
Yes, a grave.
No one's had time to die here yet.
You can see there is no graveyard.
This was a long time ago.
Actually, not such a long time.
Nearly three years.
I buried a friend here.
A friend.
Huge trees stood here.
A cedar and a fir tree.
Remember them?
Probably chopped down when the settlement was built.
Could it be those?
Dersu!
In the islands, the hunter
Roams all day long
But no luck for him
And he curses himseIf
What's he going to do
How is he to serve
He cannot be cheerful
So what
He'll try to aim better
So the hunter goes
To warmer waters
Where the fish were frolicking
In the beautiful weather
There on the shore
That year... my assignment was to go to the Shkotovo area... in the Ussurii region... to make a topographic survey.
Sometimes mountains and forests look cheerful and attractive.
At other times, they seem sullen and wild.
This isn't just my own feeling.
All the men in the unit share this feeling.
With God's help, we will spend the night here.
And tomorrow, we'll find a more cheerful place.
Very well.
We'll halt here for the night.
Yes, we'll stay here for the night.
That valley reminded me... of Walpurgis Night... a place where witches would gather for their Sabbath.
What's that?
A falling rock.
Is someone coming down?
It's a bear!
Please to not shoot!
Me are people!
Hello, Captain.
Look. A man.
You said it was a bear.
Won't you join us?
Thanks.
I am very hungry.
Nothing to eat today.
Who are you?
A Chinese?
A Korean?
No. Me is Goldi.
A hunter?
Me hunt all the time.
No other job.
Where do you live?
Not have home.
Build a shack and sleep, and living like in a home.
No luck today?
Today shoot at stag.
Me not hurt him much.
Stag run away.
Me follow after it.
Me see people tracks.
Me go slow.
Me think:
''What kind of people so far in the hills?''
Me look close.
See Captain, soldiers.
So me come here quick.
Why did you miss the stag if you're such a good hunter?
You never miss?
We're soldiers.
We're not supposed to miss.
You great hunter, shoot all beasts... we don't have anything to eat.
Hey, you!
Enough babble!
Well, well.
Here. Now you can babble.
My name is Arseniev.
What's yours?
Dersu Uzala.
How old are you?
I don't know well.
Me live a long, long time.
Do you have a family?
They all die long ago.
Before, I had a wife... son and girl.
The smallpox finish all people.
Now me left alone.
Look, Dersu.
We are surveying this area-- the ranges, passes and rivers.
Will you be our guide?
Necessary me think.
Stop it.
Well, think it over.
Now, let's go to sleep.
The next day, without saying a word...
Dersu took his place at the head of our squad.
There is a road here.
- A road!
- Come here! There's a road!
What's there?
This road two, three days before, one people come.
Then rain come.
These people Chinese.
Where did you get that?
How you not understand?
Look well!
He wear Chinese boots.
Water in his tracks.
You the same as children.
Eyes not see.
You live in the forest, die soon.
Chinese!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Soon we find shack.
How do you know?
Look!
Strip bark.
Make roof.
The rain-soaked ashes... the bed of grass... and a discarded piece of Chinese fabric... all confirmed Dersu's words.
Obviously, a Chinese spent the night a couple of days ago.
Did you see that?
Yegor!
Captain.
Rice, salt, matches, give some.
What do you need it for?
Rice, salt, matches.
Wrap in birch bark, put in shack.
You plan to return?
Why return?
Other people come.
Find dry wood.
Find food. Not die.
Olentiev!
Bring matches, rice and salt.
At your command.
This Goldi filled me with admiration.
He had amazing insight... acquired during his long life in the forest.
Besides, he had a beautiful soul.
He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know... and probably wouldn't ever see.
Dersu, let's wait until the rain stops.
Time to get ready.
Listen good.
Birds are starting to sing.
Rain soon stop.
Sun is coming out.
Dersu, do you know what the sun is?
Everyone knows the sun.
Could be that you've never seen the sun?
Look, there it is.
Captain.
Sun is the most important men.
This men die, all die.
And this is another important men.
This is bad men. Shout.
If one listens to you, everything around are men.
Look. All is men.
Water alive.
Well, you said it.
Is fire alive too?
Yes, fire is still men.
Fire angry, forest burn for many days.
Fire get angry, frightful.
Water get angry, frightful.
Wind get angry, frightful.
Fire, water, wind.
Three mighty men.
The first snow fell that day.
- Why shoot?
-Just for fun.
- Step back, Dersu.
- Waste bullets, bad.
What waste? We're soldiers.
We're practicing.
- Screw it!
- Seryoga drank too much.
Let me try. Taras!
What a shot!
Go!
What the hell?
It's harder than bringing down a flying bird.
Good shooter not miss.
Go ahead, old man.
Try it yourself.
Why shoot and smash? Why break?
Where in forest you find bottle?
Are you trying to worm your way out of it?
Just admit you won't hit it.
Me not shoot at bottle.
Me shoot at rope.
Bottle fall down, you give me bottle.
Hit the rope?
Go ahead.
It's yours if you hit the rope, and I will fill it with vodka.
Go, Marchenko!
Go!
What a man!
He certainly put one over on you, Olentiev!
Get ready to set out, men.
Go, go!
Once again, once again!
You won!
- Where is Dersu?
- God knows.
He suddenly decided to take his portion of vodka and went off.
- He's sitting by the river.
- What's he doing?
Sitting by the fire and singing.
Probably drunk.
Let me tie it.
May I sit with you for a while, Dersu?
Captain.
Over there my wife and kids die.
Smallpox.
Everyone afraid of smallpox.
Wife, kids, house, all together burn.
Last night bad dream had.
Yurt will be soon fall down.
Wife, kids in this yurt... all get freezing.
No eat.
So me come here, give them everything.
Yesterday, an old men walked along.
This men didn't sleep the night.
- How do you know?
- No sign at camp fire that he sleep.
How do you know he's old?
Young man always walk on his toes.
Old man always walk on his heels.
I met that old Chinese a few days later.
His name is Li Tsung-ping.
He is 64.
He come from Tientsin.
How did he land here?
Was a woman.
His brother took her.
He went into the mountains.
For 40 years live alone.
Thank you.
It's cold already.
Maybe we should invite the old man to come over to our fire.
Don't, Captain.
Don't disturb him.
Him now think very much.
He see house, he see garden... all in blossom.
Captain! Captain!
Li Tsung-ping come say good-bye.
Him now go home.
The ultimate goal of this expedition... was to explore the area around Lake Khanka.
We had to cross bigs swamps and roadless tracts.
I sent most of the men and horses to Chernigovka.
Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinovandl... set out for the lake in a flatboat.
Olentiev, stay here and make camp.
Dersu and I will go on.
Unload.
Captain!
Us go back soon?
Me little scared.
Lake Khanka is not far.
We won't stay there long.
All right, Captain, you see for yourself.
What is okay is okay.
Silence layover the frozen reaches of the lake.
Some menace to humans was lurking in this silence.
Captain!
Have to go back quick.
The wind cover our tracks.
Yes, yes, let's go.
Never mind, Dersu.
Now we'll know where we came from.
From there!
Captain!
Us weren't here. Bad!
Captain! Us lose road!
Road there.
But how do we get there?
There is water all around.
Captain! Sun is low.
Soon night come.
Night come, we die.
If the camp is close by, they'll hear us.
We'll have to spend the night here, Dersu.
It's dangerous to go on.
What shall we do?
Captain! Listen.
Listen good.
Have to work fast.
Us not work good, us die.
- What work?
- Cut grass.
Captain! Work fast!
Captain! Work fast!
Captain! Must hold grass!
Take rope!
Captain! Get up! Get up!
As the wind howled,
I sank into darkness.
I don't know how long I slept.
Hey, bear!
Climb out of den!
Sun is up!
Only then did I realize what Dersu had done for me.
His witshad saved me.
Thank you, Dersu.
Thank you.
What would I have done without you?
Go together, work together.
No need thanks.
That's Olentiev!
From that point on... our expedition became more difficult.
Let's go! Go!
Severe frost.
Exhaustion.
Hunger.
Man is very small before the face of nature.
Forward! Forward! Don't stop!
Forward!
Captain!
Me find smell of smoke.
Udegheis are frying fish.
Thank you.
Captain.
Where go tomorrow?
We'll reach Chernigovka, join our men there... and then take the train to Vladivostok.
Come with me.
It's nice and comfortable in town.
No, thank you.
Me cannot.
What me work in town?
Hunting, no.
Sable chase, no.
At least come to the station with me.
I'll get food and some money for you there.
Me food, money not need.
Me now search sables.
Sables same money.
What's the matter, Dersu?
Me bad man.
Me want some cartridge.
Olentiev, give him everything that's left.
Thank you, Captain.
Me tomorrow go straight ahead.
Four suns go.
Find Daubikhe... then go Ulakhen... then Fujin.
Me heard... many, many sable there.
Deer too.
Me heard about it.
People around say.
Now me understand.
Good-bye, military men.
Farewell.
Good-bye, Dersu.
Maybe we'll meet again.
Good-bye, Captain.
Well...
Maybe we'll meet again.
Good-bye.
He's a fine man.
I never met anyone like him.
He's a rare man.
May God give him good health.
In the islands, the hunter
Roams all day long
But no luck for him
And he curses himseIf
What's he going to do
How is he to serve
He cannot be cheerful
So what
He'll try to aim better
So the hunter goes
To warmer waters
That spring... once again I set out to traveI across the Ussurii area.
Go! Go!
Where are you going?
To the left!
Careful! Look after the horses!
For three months, we have been walking in the forest.
Spring in the forest quickly gave way to summer.
We've explored a large area.
But if we had Dersu, we'd have accomplished more.
All this time,
I was thinking with anticipation... that maybe I would meet him again.
Where are you, Dersu?
Up the spring, go!
Faster, guys.
Bring the water.
Andriucha!
Throw up more branches!
What is taking so long?
Faster, faster! Don't smile!
And you said you would bring a boar!
Vladimir Pavlovich.
I met a hunter two miles from here.
He was asking about our unit-- who we are, who's the captain.
Did you tell him?
How could I, sir?
I know how to keep a military secret.
Eh, Turtygin, Turtygin.
Did he remain there?
No, sir. He started to collect his backpack.
Vladimir Pavlovich!
Your rifle!
- Hello, Captain!
- Hello, Dersu!
You are my dear man.
You haven't changed at all, Dersu.
Haven't changed.
Haven't grown older.
You, my eagle with blue-black wings
Where have you been flying for so long
How have you been these years?
Shot lots of sables?
Plenty.
- Get much money.
- Oh! That's good!
Only all this money go.
How come?
Rich trader me invite.
Much vodka.
Me give him money to keep for me.
After that, his men no where.
Why so?
Me don't understand.
You, my eagle with blue-black wings
Where have you been flying forso Iong
I was flying there over the mountains
Where it all was silence
Next morning, the forest was shrouded in thick fog.
We were leading the way.
I was confident because Dersu was now with me.
Dersu, what do you think?
Will the weather clear up?
Yes.
Earth and hill all sweating now.
Soon they'll get completely well.
Why are they lagging behind?
It's high time they catch up with us.
Let us wait.
Me lost pipe.
Me think pipe be near.
Must go back.
How I lose pipe?
Either got old... or my head got bad.
Look, Captain.
This is track tiger.
Him behind us go.
When us come here, was not track on road.
Him close here.
When us stopped over there, he was right here!
Me go back, tiger run away.
That is nothing, Captain.
Tiger never make big noise.
Excuse us, Captain, for lingering.
Two horses got stuck in the bog.
Is this your pipe, Dersu?
- What is it with you?
- There's a tiger nearby.
Hey, guys, careful!
A tiger's nearby!
Calm down!
Calm down, I say!
Come on, come on!
Again tiger go our track!
Why go behind?
What do you need, tiger?
What do you want?
Us go road, not bother you, and you go behind!
Is there not enough space in forest, tiger?
Let's go!
Why have you halted?
Looks like fallen trees there.
- Dersu, what's that?
- Ludiovo.
Ludiovo? And what's that?
Animals go to river, drink water.
Want to go round trunks and branches and fall into pit.
They catch animals, sell the skins.
Detail several men to follow me.
Belonozhkin, Zagourskii, Zakharov,
Bochkariov, follow me.
Careful.
Look here.
Look in the other pits.
Go.
Sir! A doe and two reindeer there.
Already dead.
Pasha, what do you have there?
I found two pits.
Only carrion in there.
What about you, Andriucha?
I fell in myself!
Vasia! Vasia!
- What's there?
- I found a whole flaying house!
- Who did it?
- Bad Chinese did this.
Why leave ludiovo, but not fill holes?
Bad to kill animals for nothing.
Bring axes and hoes here!
What happened, Dersu?
Hounhous! Chinese bandits!
They make holes in my shirt, and I make holes in theirs!
- How many are there?
- Eight.
Turtygin, two remain here.
The rest ofyou follow me.
They got away, the vipers.
Hounhous bad Chinese.
Bad.
Steal money, fur.
Steal wife, kill men.
Sir, here.
Hounhous steal three women.
Me not understand what they do with men.
Turtygin!
Hey, guys, come here quick!
Much mosquito, horsefly there.
By night your face like this.
Then much pain.
Then die.
Good us found at daytime.
Very, very good.
All alive.
I'll kill those Hounhous!
Hounhous!
That Chang Pao, not Hounhous!
My name's Chang Pao.
We fight Hounhous.
I'm Arseniev.
We're exploring this area.
- Hello.
- Hello.
They took the women with them, as always.
Hounhous go there.
Move, hurry!
Dersu, calm down.
They won't get far away.
Will you take care of these men?
Detachment, fall in.
Detachment, fall in.
In those places where they robbed and killed... people told us that the bandits are not more than ten.
We'll handle them ourselves.
Well, good luck then.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Danger no.
Hounhous end.
At first sight, this river seemed quiet and peaceful.
I sent some men with horses to look for a place to ford it.
I myself with the others tried to cross the river on a raft.
Stand here.
Let me.
Pull it!
Give me the weapons.
The pole! Where's the pole?
The pole! Throw it!
Come on! Do it!
Go along the bank, men!
Along the bank!
Run along the bank!
Get ahead of us! Ahead!
Run ahead!
Jump, Captain, jump!
Come on, come on!
- If we only had a rope!
- We used all the rope for the raft!
Cut down tree! Cut down!
- This one?
- No!
- This one?
- No!
- This one?
- Uh-huh!
Get the axes!
Tie the tree! Quick!
Tie the tree!
Take off your belts!
These will do too.
- We'll need levers.
- Cut them!
Hold on! Hold on!
Come on, guys, faster, faster!
How are you there?
Hold it!
Let it go little by little!
Go, go, go!
Hold it! Let go!
Dersu, give me your hand!
Grab me!
You were like a bear!
Summer end, Captain.
Autumn come.
That's good.
A bit to the left.
A bit to the left.
Good.
Okay, get ready.
Attention.
Hold it.
Good.
Turtygin, come here.
Now you take a picture of us.
Press here, okay?
My fondest memories of Dersu... are connected with the beginning of that autumn.
- What's wrong with that horse?
- Tiger.
Listen, tiger!
Soldiers fire rifle!
You go away. Go away!
What me do?
Kill tiger.
The tiger ran away.
He's unharmed.
No, tiger always run until die.
Now me much frightened.
Don't be afraid, Dersu.
A dead tiger can't harm you.
Kanga will!
He send another tiger!
Kanga is a forest spirit whom the Goldi worship.
From that day Dersu changed.
He became morose and irritabIe.
What you do?
That sign say no ginseng here.
You break.
People search for ginseng, all for nothing.
Bad man are you.
So he just jumped in the river in all his clothes. He was drunk.
In all his clothes!
And I had an adventure--
Why throw meat into fire?
Meat throw into fire, lose.
Tomorrow we go, other people here come... see meat, eat.
Who would come here?
How's that? Who come?
Badger come, marten come.
Crow come, mouse come.
All kinds of men in forest.
Good evening, Dersu.
I say, salute!
The Ussurii autumn is brief.
Winter colds come fast.
I started getting ready for winter... and sent some of the men with all our horses to Olga Bay.
Smells! Men here!
- What men?
- Boars!
I don't smell anything.
- Dersu, why didn't you shoot?
- I not see.
Why not me see boar?
My nose see better than eyes.
I did not know then... that this small incident was a fore runner of tragic events.
A stag!
Where, Captain?
Where?
There, under the half-fallen tree.
- Did I hit it?
- No.
Didn't you see it?
Everyone misses sometimes, Dersu.
Why me not hit it?
Captain! Before,
I always first see an animal!
Shoot, always hit target.
Now not hit.
Bad are my eyes.
How I live in forest now?
Come to Khabarovsk with me.
My home is your home.
New Year's Eve came.
It was a strange night.
The tiger come to kill me.
Thank you, Captain!
Thank you!
What happened, Dersu?
Captain, you say your home my home.
Thank you, Captain!
Will you come with me to my place?
My eyes get bad.
Kanga not want me to live in forest.
He send the tiger.
Probably what Dersu called the tiger... was the specter of his fear of the forest... conjured by the imagination... of a man grown old.
Listen here.
Vova recorded Dersu.
Well, well.
The Captain go hills, work.
Go back to city... sit at a table, write, work.
Me no work in the city.
Stare into fire.
Look at hills far away.
And that's it.
It's true.
He doesn't like the city.
Never mind.
He'll get used to it.
Vova, did Dersu hear it?
Yes.
- What did he say?
- He said, ''Right, not word miss.''
Does he often talk to you about the forest?
Yes. Dersu is not afraid of anything.
Neither of wolves, nor of boars, or of bears.
Snow storms and floods are nothing for him.
You know, Dersu is Vova's hero.
He is crazy about him.
And I owed him my life on several occasions.
He never mentioned it.
Well, he thinks it is quite a regular thing to do.
Most people like to boast about such things and exaggerate.
This men always with me roam the forest... many, many years.
This is a bear tooth... and claws.
And these are claws of lynx.
For you. Take.
You give it to me?
Yes, Little Captain.
Really?
I am so happy.
It will be my talisman.
Don't you have tiger claws?
Didn't you hunt a tiger?
I shoot at tiger but--
It bad to kill tiger.
Why?
Very... very bad.
Take this. Thank you.
Why give money for water?
Much water is in river.
- Why you take money for water?
- What?
You don't understand anything.
You are bad man!
- Where are you going?
- Shoot.
Don't even think of it! It's not allowed to shoot guns in a city.
In barrel much dirt.
Me shoot a bullet, clean barrel.
Then wipe with cloth, shoot well.
There are many people here.
It's dangerous.
Me fire not people.
Me fire at air.
All the same, you cannot.
The city isn't the same as the hills.
Do you understand?
Do you?
Well, how are you, Dersu?
Sit I here, just like duck.
How can men sit in box?
You are right.
It isn't a very nice room.
We'll have to change the wallpaper... make everything more cozy.
Meanwhile, what if you live in my study.
Don't bother, Captain.
I pitch tent outdoors.
Sleep.
I don't disturb anyone.
See, Dersu... it's not allowed in a city.
Why not?
Bad!
How should I explain?
That's a rule.
A rule.
Shoot a gun I can't.
Sleep outdoors I can't.
I not get enough air at all.
Pa, what happened?
Dersu's been arrested!
The police just called.
What is it again?
You know, he saw me buying firewood yesterday and grew very angry... and went to the city park to chop down a tree.
Please... let me go back to hills.
Live in city I cannot.
Where will you go?
To the hills.
Captain.
Missus.
Little Captain.
All fine people.
Me go-- bad!
But I cannot live in a city.
Here, take this rifle as a gift.
New model.
It's easy to aim.
Même avec une vue faible tu toucheras au but.
Thank you. Captain
To Mr Arseniev
Your visiting card found on dead goldi.
Request your presence to identify the body.
Police Headquerters.
Mr Arseniev ?
Did you know him ?
We were friends !
And his name was ?
- Dersu Uzala...
- His occupation ?
- A hunter.
- A hunter. How strange.
He didn't have a rifle.
There must have been.
A rifle of the latest model.
No, nothing was found... except your visiting card...
It's clear now : the criminal wanted the rifle so he killed the man.
- Ready Sir.
- The ground is frozen. It was hard digging the grave.
Bury him !
So now I'll ask you to sign.
Beg your pardon. I'm a busy man
Thank you.
So... May I leave ?
THE CIRCUS
THE CIRCUS
"So you missed the hoop again."
"Father, I couldn't help it."
"For that you don't eat tonight."
"And you're supposed to be funny!"
"Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
"Here you are, sir."
"Count it."
"Is it all there?"
"Say, gimme that money!"
"How d'you get out of here?"
"Rotten!"
"Get off!"
"Where's the funny man?"
"Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
"Father won't let me."
"Do you want a job?"
"Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
Hungry.
"Run along home!"
"I live here."
"Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
"Go ahead and be funny."
"That's awful!"
"Put on the William Tell act."
"Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
"Go ahead and try it."
"Put on the barber-shop act."
"Now I must hit you."
"Now hit me!"
"I can't see."
"Just a moment!"
"We haven't talked terms yet."
"Get out and stay out!"
"Show's starting!"
"Aren't you coming in?"
"You're not leaving?"
"You see, we couldn't come to terms."
"Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the
Property Men.
"How about our back pay?"
"Get to work!"
"We quit!"
"They've quit."
"Get anybody!"
"Do you want a job?"
"Don't touch that button!"
"He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it."
"Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man.
And the girl led the same hard life.
"Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
"Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
"The horse blew first --"
"Open the door, quick!"
"I told you the lions were dangerous!"
"Where's that pill?"
"Come here!"
"I've got to see a doctor!"
"It's a shame the way they make you work --"
"And you the hit of the show."
"Why of course!"
"All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
"I knew it!"
"If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
"And what's more
I want what I'm worth --"
"I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
"Sixty!"
"I'll double it!"
"Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
"Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
"I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction,
Rex, a tight-rope walker.
"Pardon me."
"Go right ahead."
"I'll give you
Five Dollars for it."
"It's happened; I'm in love!"
"He's a tight-rope walker."
"I've just met him."
"Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
"What's the matter?"
"You hardly got a laugh!"
"This is my friend."
"I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus;
New Hopes and
New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
"Never mind the rope."
"You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance- and not a smile.
"I've had enough of this;"
"You get one more chance."
"Where's Rex?"
"Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
"Is Rex here?"
"You can do the act, can't you?"
"You'll do it or quit!"
"I'll do it; find his clothes!"
"There's the clothes!"
"You follow her!"
"He'll kill himself."
"That's all right;"
"I've got him insured."
"Take your time, there's another act to go on."
"Why, what is the meaning of this?"
"I am taking his place on the rope."
"You'll get killed."
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
"I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
"Not a word to anybody."
"Please don't do this."
"You've forgotten your tights."
"You're on!"
"You're through!!!"
That Night.
"I've run away from the circus."
"I'll never go back."
"Can't you take me with you?"
"I've got an idea."
"You stay here."
"Have you seen Merna?"
"She's run away --"
"I can do nothing for her -- --"
"Now, there's one way out."
"She's there now?"
"Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
"So you've come back -- You -- !"
"You're speaking to my wife!"
"Will you go on with the show?"
"-- -- if you take him."
"The end wagon for you."
"Come in with us."
He dies for a rifle.
¿Murió bien, eh?
¿Pero para qué?
¿Para esto?
¡Para nada! ¡Para nada!
Whoa.
Let's go, men.
¡Alto!
¡Chica! Vàmonos!
Good morning, amigo.
Maybe you can help me.
No hablo inglés.
Esto es Mexico.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Español.
Can I help you?
- What was he saying?
- That you're in Mexico now.
That anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish.
You, uh, in command here?
No, but I speak English.
Seen this man?
Hey, Joe.
- Mornin', darlin'.
- Where you going, Joe?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way.
You say all day, all night.
All night, all day?
Did I say that?
- You say.
- Ah.
Well, uh, things is different now.
The soldiers.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Why don't you try this hotel.
He may be in there.
You mean they let Indians in there?
Anyone who can pay, sir.
One moment, please.
What is your name?
I am Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme from the Imperial German Army.
I'm what you'd call an adviser.
I'm Lyedecker.
Policeman.
You got some money?
Money?
What the hell for?
Get out of the window!
For me, yes?
Some dollars for me?
I saw you got dollars.
- I thought you said you loved me.
- Sure.
You give me money?
Yeah, well, later, maybe, huh?
I yell pretty loud.
Then the sergeant come up.
You want to talk to them?
What do you want to do with them?
Well...
Well, what do you mean?
They were pulling out the railroad track.
Your track.
Oh, my company's.
Not mine.
Why do they do that?
Damn it!
Why?
Why have they been fighting us for 400 years?
Because they're Yaqui Indians, that's why.
They call them los tigres de la rocas... the tigers of the rocks.
They say your track is on their land.
What shall we do about it?
Oh, whatever's customary.
Whatever you think is right.
Of course.
Muy bien.
Verdugo...
Verdugo...
I'm no part of this.
Do what you like... a trial.
I'm no part of this.
Look.
I know the value of things.
Bullets are valuable.
These are not.
No.
Listen.
Don't be like that.
You can give me money... or I'll make you some trouble.
Come here.
- Sargento Paletes!
- Señor.
Run! Run!
Run, Indians!
Run, Indians! Run!
Run!
Hey!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
¡Cabrón!
Mi general.
He is our prisoner.
Too bad I had to interrupt your entertainment up there.
Yes, you distracted my soldiers...
disbanded the Indians...
Very clever.
But now I got you.
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have me if that hotel had a back door.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Now, General, you don't wanna do that.
He's a very valuable man.
If you got to kill him, why don't you let me have him?
Perhaps I will kill you too.
That won't get you very much either.
- He's your friend?
- He's no friend of mine.
Well, then, what is he to you?
Bank robber.
He stole $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Lyedecker... how much did you say he stole?
Six thousand dollars.
- Uh-huh. When?
- Twelve days ago.
Twelve days, huh?
I see.
Fifty dollars.
Where is the rest?
You look Mexican, but you don't talk Mexican.
- What the hell are you?
- Well, I sure as hell ain't no damn Mexican.
My mama was a Yaqui Indian... and my daddy was from Alabama.
I see.
Well, I hope you know how to die.
I admire a man who dies well.
Now, tell me... where is the money? Hmm?
The money.
All those dollars you speak of.
Where are they?
Women and whiskey.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Oh?
Six thousand dollars in 12 days?
Oh!
You could be the biggest stallion in the world...
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
Now...
No.
No, it was not spent on women or on whiskey.
Now, for the last time, where is the money?
Just like he said, jefe.
Half of it I spent on whiskey and women... and the other half I wasted.
Excuse me, sir, but if he spent the entire night in the hotel... don't you...
Yes.
Yes, let's go and take a look.
Where is the money?
Hey, friend, I hear your mama sells it on the street.
I don't think he understands English.
All that's fine.
But where's the money?
You really the honest-to-God law?
Somethin' wrong with that?
No! No.
You caught me, didn't ya?
That's right.
Now I gotta see about gettin' you out of here.
See, you bein' the Yankee law don't cut no ice with the Mexican army.
They ain't gonna let you get out of here.
Well, why don't you buy us out?
The money ain't worth gettin' killed for, now, is it?
I ain't got no money.
- Bank says different.
- Oh, I took it, all right.
But I spent it two days later.
- What did you spend it on?
- Rifles.
Rifles?
One hundred rifles for the Yaqui Indians.
Them poor devils hangin' on them telephone poles out there... them's Yaqui Indians... my people.
Well, if you tellin' the truth... that general's gonna kill you real slow.
Well, let me tell you about that general.
They told him to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could... and he took the easy way.
He's just killin' everybody.
Well, you've spent enough time in the States. You as American as me.
And you know you just can't go around stickin' up banks.
Yeah.
But I ain't goin' back.
Yes, you are.
On foot, on horseback, or hangin' across a saddle, you're goin' back.
How is it over there?
It's crowded over here.
How about out there?
Well, I think, with a little bit of luck, we might be able to get out of this.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna jump right out that window behind you.
Go ahead.
¡Sargento Paletes!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
Yaqui!
Mi caballo.
¡Sargento! ¡Vamos!
Well, I think we lost 'em.
All of'em.
Well, do you bring the rifles?
You damn betcha.
Romero send you?
Where are the rifles, Joe?
How come he sent a woman?
- They're expecting a man.
- Oh.
Now, uh, where are the rifles, Joe?
On the Chilina trail, not too far from here.
Well, I hope so.
They're there.
And where is the profit for you, Joe?
There ain't none, Sarita.
Look, you told me to get the rifles, and I got 'em.
- What are you bein'so tough on me for?
- Because I know you.
Boy, you sure have soured up in the last few years, ain't ya?
Yes. I have changed.
I watched them hang my father... and I helped him to die.
You hear that?
I helped my father to die.
You say the Chilina trail?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Mara.
Oh, shoot.
Now, why'd you do that?
I wasn't gonna do nothin'
I couldn't have done before.
You're pretty good, Joe.
I can't take any chances with you.
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?
Back to Phoenix.
How come them to give you a badge in the first place?
Well, I guess I took a job that nobody else wanted.
Even at that, it took me a whole year to get it.
- How much they gon' give you for takin' me back?
- Two hundred dollars.
And the job permanent-like.
Shoot, that ain't even hardly worth botherin' about.
Well, Joe, that depends on what you got in the first place.
Yeah.
I ain't never been worth a damn in my whole damn life.
Ain't never been worth nothin' to talk about.
I never even had a job permanent-like.
But now I finally done somethin' for somebody... me.
I finally amounted to somethin'.
Yeah.
You robbed a bank.
Let's go.
I should have known.
You lied to me.
There's no sign of tracks.
No people. No guns.
What are you talkin' about?
They're there. Come on. I'll show you.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
- Where do you find him?
- I didn't find him! He found me!
Will he help us?
- Señor, will you help?
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You ain't got nothin' better to do.
- It ain't my party.
Come on.
So, we meet again, huh?
You murderer!
You assassin!
Too bad I don't have enough time for you right now.
Lopez!
Now you...
Mr. Sheriff.
Mr. Half-breed.
By the time
I'm through with you... you'll be ready to tell me everything I want to know.
I'm not afraid.
Damn it!
Stay on your feet!
Go to hell!
Damn you, you big son of a...
Muy bien.
Ay. Look what the rurales found.
Rifles.
Two Indians with these mules.
Now, how would two Indians... find 100 rifles, huh?
They were skinned alive.
Slowly.
But they wouldn't say.
Tsk tsk.
Nice day, Verdugo.
Indeed it is, Mr. Grimes.
Hello.
My name's Grimes.
Steven Grimes.
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Mighty nice.
Well...
You know, fellow Americans.
And, uh, what's a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?
I'm with Southern Pacific.
We run the railroads here.
Then, uh, you're really all right with that general, ain't you?
Look, Lyedecker, what's the point of all this?
If you don't tell him what he wants to know, he'll have you killed.
Well, maybe put a good word in for us.
- Why don't you get the hell outta here?
- Tell him something.
Anything.
Six thousand dollars is not worth dying for.
And he's just gonna let us go.
Is that right?
Why don't you go away and stop botherin' us?
Look.
If he has you shot, it'll create terrible problems.
- It'll be a terrible thing for all of us.
- Sure as hell will.
- For us or for the railroad?
- For both.
The way relations are between the United
States and Mexico...Well, you know.
Look... we don't wanna talk to you.
You understand?
We don't wanna talk to you.
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
He's got the rifles, and he's got us too.
What do we got to lose?
Tell you what you do.
You go tell that general I wanna see him.
What about my men?
How are they progressing?
Well, sir, they fight well, they train well.
They don't seem to take too naturally to the drill.
Well, the parades will come later.
As long as they can fight.
Sit down.
Sit down.
What disturbs you?
The rifles, sir.
Someone is arming the Yaquis.
If they get hold of any more guns, you're going to have the tiger by its tail.
The Yaquis do not have the rifles.
I do.
Yes, sir, at the moment you do.
Von Klemme, you worry me.
That was my intent, sir.
No. I mean, you worry me.
- Oh?
- Yes.
You...You seem afraid.
Of what?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you would return to Mexico City...
I would prefer nothing more than that, sir, if my orders could be changed.
You know that I don't need you.
But, you see, sir... we Germans are here to advise, so we advise.
Oh, yes.
Now, tell me, what perfect piece of advice have you this time?
Finish off the Yaquis as quickly as possible before more guns come through.
I know that, don't I?
Of course you do. Then send them south and sell them to the wood merchants.
No. It isn't worth it.
The prices are too low.
I have to feed them, send some of my men with them.
By the time we sell one, the price will be lower than the price of a cow.
Then kill them all.
That is your advice?
That is my advice, sir.
Very good.
So, all the time, eh?
All the time the $6,000 was right there in my front yard, huh?
Incredible.
- I'll take him back now, General.
That's the deal. Right?
- Now wait.
Wait.
Tell me something.
Where are the other rifles?
I don't know what you're talking about.
When do they arrive?
Answer the question, Indian.
- You got 'em all.
- That is not the answer!
- There ain't no more guns!
- How do you know that?
You know, Lyedecker, as I told you before,
I think you're part of it.
I ain't a part of anything!
This man stole $6,000. For that amount of money, there can't be no more guns.
You refuse to answer, eh?
Look, there ain't no more damn guns.
Very well.
Too bad, gentlemen.
¡Sargento Paletes!
What did all that mean?
Look like they're gonna shoot us.
Verdugo, I suggested that if they told you about the money... you'd let them go.
Grimes, you run the railroad.
I'll run the state of Sonora.
And don't you ever forget it.
- Por favor, General...
- ¡No, señor!
¡Alto!
You know somethin'?
What?
I think our string has done run out.
The hell it has.
We're gonna get out of this.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Well, there's nothin' to it.
A big, giant hand is gonna reach in here, pick us up... take us away and put us down someplace... right in the middle of a whole bunch of women and whiskey.
That ain't funny.
Well, I ain't laughin' neither.
That ain't funny at all!
Stay out of other people's business.
That's what I always said and that's what I always done.
But look at me now.
Smart Lyedecker.
Hung up on a fence with a bunch of scruffy Indians.
Well, that's too bad about you.
Your number's comin' up over there, and it's just too damn bad.
- You know why?
- No, I don't know why. Why?
- 'Cause you'd have been a hell of a lawman.
- You damn right!
'Cause you don't care about nothin' or nobody... just like all them big boys with their badges.
What do you know about badges?
You're just a pissant border half-breed.
I know a lot about it.
I know all about them small-town, barbershop, hair-cuttin' sheriffs.
And I know all about them big-town, big-bellied... billy club-swingin' policemen from St. Louis.
- You don't know nothin'!
- The hell I don't!
They look you up and down, and you're guilty!
You don't get no trial, just like we ain't gonna get one now!
'Cause them guys over there don't care about nothin' or nobody, just like you!
That's why you'd have been so good with a badge.
Washington's going to react very badly to this.
What are they going to do?
Send a note saying,
"Where is our black policeman?"
- And then what?
- They'll ask questions.
They're going to ask my company a great many questions.
And they will get answers,
I'm sure.
Your company cares for its trains... not for two gringos that disappear in Mexico.
¡Fuego!
Hold it, gentlemen.
Padre.
My sons, allow me to help you...
We ain't no damn sons of yours.
There's probably more than one scattered around here someplace.
Fear and despair are human failings.
Yet we are human.
Make yourselves ready to die in peace and love.
Why don't you talk to Verdugo about some of that peace and love... instead of tryin' to get somebody ready to die.
That's right.
Ain't no man ever died ready for it.
I want you to go with love in your hearts.
I want you to go to hell.
Allow me to hear your confession.
Whatever you got in that book, just put me down for it.
- Lyedecker.
- What?
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this.
You ain't half as sorry as me.
¡Ataque!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Come on!
¡Rapido!
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
Hyah! Hyah!
I want their heads.
Some kind of woman, ain't she?
Yeah. Kinda stout.
Now that you got them rifles...
what are you gonna do with 'em?
- Take 'em to General Romero.
- General.
Why every time four Mexicans get together, one of'em makes himself a general?
Look, you.
Romero can call himself anything he wants.
I knew him when he was young... when he brought the people together to fight.
Good or bad, he's all we have.
It's a good thing you have him,
'cause me and that one there, we goin' north.
We are, huh?
Yeah.
What do you say we wait till we get them rifles to General Romero?
Then I'll go easy-like.
Uh-uh. No good.
Lyedecker, you're a mule-headed son of a bitch.
You saw all them Indians hung up like a side of beef.
- After all the trouble we went through to get them rifles...
- We?
Yeah, we!
Look, I spent 15 years in the 9th Cavalry... keepin' the law and chasin' bad Indians.
But this one ain't my business, it ain't my fight and it ain't my job!
And besides...
I don't much like Indians anyway.
We should have killed him!
Yeah.
I think she's right.
You know your trouble, big man?
You're dumb.
Just plain ol'black-ass dumb!
Now who's dumb, you half-breed?
Huh?
I am!
Let me up!
Come on!
Thank you.
Don't shoot him!
And let him kill you?
The rifles, they are more important.
I don't wanna drag his big ass all over Mexico.
- What's it gon' be?
- I guess I ain't got much of a choice, have I?
We split up here.
You take the guns upriver.
I'll meet you in Delgado.
I'm glad to meet you.
Ah.
Woman, what are they looking at?
It's the first time they've seen a black man before.
Well, if they wait a while, they'll see this one turn into a chili bean.
I sure wish I had myself a fried steak.
Well, two or three times now, you could've killed me.
Sí.
That is true.
- I need you.
- What for?
Mira.
Those rifles, they are what keeps Joe here.
He is what keeps you here.
I want you to help us.
No, I won't do that.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon I am.
Oh, not of being shot at.
That's happened plenty before.
Lyedecker, if... if you would join with us... for just a little while...
I won't worry about YaquiJoe.
Afterwards, you can have him.
You ain't, uh, partial to him?
No.
I don't trust him.
He's a bad man.
But he's smart... and he's important for us now.
Nothing else?
No.
Nothing.
No deals. I'm gonna take him back, and there ain't gonna be no deals.
We got problems. Verdugo's about one mile behind us, but I don't think he saw us.
Get the rifles. Let's get out of here.
¡Vámonos!
Adios.
Gracias, kid.
Keep goin'!
Go on!
- ¡ Sargento!
- Mi general.
Collect all the children and take them to the rancho.
With the general's permission, the time might be better spent collecting the rifles.
Von Klemme, I'm gonna tell you something once and for all...
and let it be a lesson for your future.
I never do anything without a purpose, and remember that.
Humara.
Los niños. Los niños.
El rancho.
El rancho.
Yaqui.
The children.
They've taken all of the children... and holding them for the rifles.
They're holding 'em for us too, you can bet.
Well, we have to go back.
Look, Sarita, I think we ought to go on to Romero... give 'em the guns, and get some more men, huh?
No. We have to get those children.
We will.
We'd better make this quick and quiet.
Shh!
Well, I wonder if he died ready for it.
Get them kids out of here!
Hey, big fella.
How you doin', man?
Where's Joe?
Where's the whiskey?
I guess you never can tell where they might go to drink, huh?
Don't-Don't shoot, Lyedecker!
For God's sake, don't shoot!
- I didn't know it was you.
- Obviously!
Hey, Joe, look what I found.
Hey, Big Ben.
You ain't still thinking about taking me to Phoenix with you, are ya?
You'd better believe it, hombre.
Well, you're a stubborn, son of a...
Damn.
Well, what's you gonna do with him?
Well, uh, whatever's customary and whatever you think is right.
I'll-I'll be glad to take care of him for you.
Lyedecker, this is silly.
There's no need for...
Keep him alive.
We might be able to use him later.
I'll do it.
Didn't turn out to be much, did it?
Hmm?
Pretty fancy, huh?
For me?
Too fancy for me?
She had one like it when my father worked here a long time ago.
She's dead now...
Verdugo's wife.
I always wanted one like it.
It looks like you were born for it.
It's a lie. But you're a pretty good man after all, Lyedecker.
I guess I know that.
I know what I am.
I don't have to go looking for it.
Then why are you a policeman?
It's a job.
Everybody has to do something.
What the job is ain't important.
It's how you do it.
Are you good at what you do?
Well, it ain't much different than the cavalry. I do the best I can.
Well, that is a hard thing to do.
For all the bad things
I have said to you...
I give you this.
No. No! No!
No! No!
Please, not like this!
Not with you.
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
Lyedecker.
He died yesterday.
Ah, sí. The black gringo.
We have heard of you.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Good day for travelin', and we're gonna travel.
Hey.
What is this stuff?
What is this "mi general"?
- You mean you don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Well, it seems that you have been elected the new general.
I ain't no damn general.
That's just...
That's the dumbest...
That's just plumb crazy! Come on!
Buenos días, general.
Look, you tell them to get out of here.
Tell them I don't want 'em following me.
Tell 'em to go away.
Tell 'em I ain't no general.
Not for no bad-ass Indians.
Not for nobody.
You tell 'em.
It looks to me like... you're back in the cavalry business...
mi general.
I'm sure the rifles are somewhere up there.
I can promise you that, with Romero.
No.
If he gets the guns and the ammunition... he will probably come down that mountain, and we'll have war.
I know Romero.
He's a dying tiger.
He wouldn't come downhill with an army of 10,000 cannons.
No.
Lyedecker is the one.
I want his head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see.
Lyedecker and the others.
Sir, I personally think we ought to be going after Romero.
Now, listen to me, Von Klemme.
I know Romero.
I know these mountains.
I know my country, and you don't!
So shut up.
Shut up and follow my orders.
I want Lyedecker.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
Buenos noches, mi general.
Lyedecker?
Oh. Your supper is almost ready.
- Tortillas?
- No.
Look what I found.
You said fried steak.
Is that, um, the way it is?
If that's the way you want it.
No.
Let me get that.
Here?
Lyedecker, you are my man.
You know, you gotta be, uh, careful about a thing like that.
I don't have to be careful.
I am your woman for as long as you want it.
Do you want me?
What does Verdugo use that train for?
- What are you going to do?
- Answer the question.
Now, look, you can't be...
You're not going to wreck the train?
In one minute, I'm gonna pinch off your head... and mail it back to the home office.
The train carries troops and supplies from Nogales to Hermosillo.
It's well-guarded.
Does it make any stops along the way?
No.
- No stops.
- There is a water tower...
in the plano, the flat part.
He stops there.
Now, look, you're not going to wreck the train.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Lyedecker...
God!
Dear God!
He ain't gonna help you.
¡ Hey, muchachos!
¡Una muchacha!
No, no, no, no.
He ain't here.
Well, must be he didn't make the trip then...
'cause I've been watchin' this car all the time.
- How many did we lose?
- I don't know for sure.
Hey. You did a real fine job.
You seen Grimes?
No.
Last time I saw him, we were diggin' in.
I saw him.
He had a horse.
I guarantee you, he's almost to Nogales by now.
What the hell are we gonna do now?
Load the train up.
We're still goin' in.
- Uh, hello. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
¿ Verdugo aquí?
Well, is he here?
Grimes, I should have you shot.
What are you trying to do, become an adventurer?
Well, that's good, because the role does not suit you.
Tell me, Mr. Grimes... how did you happen to be with them in the first place?
I was taken at the point of a gun.
I was a prisoner.
- For so long?
- All right.
He did return... finally.
- You escaped, huh?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
They're going to attack the town.
Really?
- How?
- They've taken the train.
Are you sure?
You saw it?
I heard the plans.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Of course not.
Look.
Let them come in.
And after they've gotten off the train... we can catch them in the streets.
Mr. Grimes, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
First, you have them nicely trapped on the train... and then you allow them to get into the streets and houses?
Grimes... your train will be a small sacrifice to our cause.
- Go check up there... the machine gun.
- Yes, sir.
¡Alto!
¡ Fuego!
Sarita!
We did all right, didn't we?
Yeah, I guess we did.
I mean, we won, didn't we?
Well.
We won, huh?
Yep.
I think I can put the train back into running order. I thought you'd like to know that.
It'll take time, and I'll need men for the labor.
Yeah.
It's important that, uh... we know where we stand, huh?
What the hell for?
Well, look out there.
You're their leader now.
You should think about that.
- I ain't no dadgum such thing.
- They think you are.
They do?
This place is yours, and you have an army.
With them, you can control the entire area for good or bad.
You're ready to say no to that?
Damn right I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
A man like you... with your intelligence?
The whole state can be yours.
All of Sonora.
- No. Hell, no.
- You have to.
The choice isn't yours.
The decision's been taken out of your hands.
Do you know what'll happen if you walk away from all this? There'll be anarchy.
- What...
- These people...
Your people, they'll drift apart without a leader.
And then another general will come from Mexico City... with another army, and these streets'll run with blood again.
You'll need to move men and supplies.
You'll need the railroad.
I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Lyedecker!
- Hey, you ain't leavin' are you?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
I mean, I ain't goin' with ya.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
What are you gonna say?
Well, I'll tell 'em I just didn't bring you back, Joe.
Of course, they'll be able to see that for themselves anyway, won't they?
Yeah, but you're the leader.
I mean, if you go, there could be anarchy.
There could be blood in the streets.
Look, Joe, they'll follow you now.
In fact, it could be a good deal for you.
Yeah, but, Lyedecker, what do you got to go back to?
You came down here with nothin', not even a job permanent.
- After all them years, nothin'.
- Yeah, I thought about that.
You did?
What'd you think?
I thought I oughta go back and give it one more shot.
Lyedecker, maybe
I oughta go back with ya.
You don't wanna do that, Joe.
You belong here, and I belong up north.
Like I said,
I wanna give it that one more shot.
And, Joe, good luck, amigo.
All right, dadgumit, let's get this dadgum army together!
All right!
All right!
Hi, I've got a tapewriter to play.

"Heaven"
Everyone is trying to get to the bar. The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven. The band in Heaven they play my favorite song. They play it one more time, they play it all night long.
Oh heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens. Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
There is a party, everyone is there. Everyone will leave at exactly the same time. When this party’s over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
When this kiss is over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same. It’s hard to imagine that nothing at all could be so exciting, could be this much fun.
Oh, heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.

"Thank You For Sending
Me An Angel"
Oh, Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. You can walk, you can talk just like me. You can look, tell me what you see. You can look, you won’t see nothing like me if you look around the world.
Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. With a little practice, you can walk like, talk just like me. If that’s what you wanna do. Well, you can look, you’II walk in circles around me. But first, I’II walk in circles ’round you. But first, I’II walk around the world.

"Found a Job"
"Damn that television what a bad picture!" "Don’t get upset, it’s not a major disaster." "There’s nothing on tonight," he said, "I don’t know what’s the matter!" "Nothing’s ever on", she said, "so I don’t know why you bother."
We’ve heard this little scene, we’ve heard it many times. People fighting over little things, and wasting precious time.
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me. Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.
Judy’s in the bedroom, inventing situations. Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations. They’ve enlisted all their family. They’ve enlisted all their friends. It helped saved their relationship, And made it work again.
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit. There might even be a spinoff, but they’re not sure ’bout that. Just look at Bob and Judy; they’re happy as can be, Inventing situations, putting them on T.V.

"Life During Wartime"
Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway a place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, trucks are loading everything’s ready to roll I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or C. B. G. B. I ain’t got time for that now
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, PA?
You oughta know not to stand by the window somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter to last a couple of days But I ain’t got no speakers ain’t got no headphones ain’t got no records to play
Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time?
Can’t write a letter, can’t send a postcard I can’t write nothing at all
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around I’d love you hold you, I’d like to kiss you I ain’t got no time for that now
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock we blended in with the crowd We got computers, we’re tapping phone lines I know that ain’t allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now don’t know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender we make a pretty good team Don’t get exhausted, I’II do some driving you ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won’t help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace the burning keeps me alive
"Making Flippy Floppy"
Wait a minute, to everybody get in line!
Nothing can come between us Nothing gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy Nothing turns you on
You don’t have to wait for more instructions No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs, feet in the air Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain
Snap into position Bounce till you ache
Step out of line And you end up in jail
Doctor Doctor We have nothing in our pockets
We continue But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window Hey! they are just my friends
Check this out don’t be so slick Break our backs it goes like this.
We are born without eyesight We are born without sin
And our mama protects us From the cold and the rain
We’re in no hurry sugar and spice We sing in the darkness We open our eyes
I can’t believe it And people are strange Our president’s crazy Did you hear what he said
Business and pleasure Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections And then give it away
There are no big secrets Don’t believe what you read We have great big bodies We got great big heads
Run-a-run-a-run it all together Check it out - still don’t make no sense Makin’ flippy floppy Tryin to do my best
Lock the door We kill the beast Kill it!
"Swamp"
Now lemme tell you a story The devil he has a plan
A bag o’ bones in his pocket Got anything you want
No dust and no rocks The whole thing is over All these beauties in solid motion All those beauties, they're gonna swallow you up Let's go!
Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, One time too many Too far to go Hi we're gonna take you home
And when they split those atoms It’s hotter than the sun
Blood is a special substance They gonna pray for that man
So wake up young lovers The whole thing is over Watch out touch monkeys All that blood, they gonna swallow you whole
Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, So soft, hard feelings No tricks lets go Hi we come to take you home
How many people do you think I am? Pretending I'm somebody else You can pretend I’m and old millionaire, a millionaire washing his hands
Rattle of bones, dreams that stick out, a medical chart on the wall
Soft violence and hands touch your throat, ev’ryone wants to explode
And when your hands get dirty, nobody knows you at all
Don’t have a window to slip out of, lights on, nobody home
Click click - see ya later Beta beta - no time to rest Peeka peeka risky business All that blood, they were covered in mess. Let’s go
"What a Day
That Was"
Well, I’m dressed up so nice, an’ I’m doin’ my best An’ I’m startin’ over; I’m startin’ over in another place Lemme tell you a story, big chief with a golden crown
He’s got rings on his fingers, and then he walks up, up to the throne He’s makin’ shapes with his hands, an’ don’t choo dare sit back Now don’t choo dare sit down, and don’t choo dare speak up!
Oh and on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh who could’ve asked for more?
And on the second day, we had nothing else left to do Ooh what a day that was, mmm wah!
Well there are 50,000 beggars roaming in the streets And they have lost all their possessions; they have nothing left to eat Down come a bolt of lightning, start an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction, go pull a fire alarm I said that I’m dreaming of a city, it was my own invention I put the wheels in motion, a time for big decisions, ho ho
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, ho
Oh a day that was Oh ho, and that’s the way it goes There’s a million ways - to get things done There’s a million ways - to make things work out.
Well I’m going right through and the light came down And they’re roundin’ ’em up from all over town, ha ha They’re movin’ forward & backwards, they're movin’ backwards & front
And they’re enjoying themselves, moving in ev’ry direction And if you feel like you’re in a whirlpool, you feel like going home You feel like talking to someone Who knows the differences between right and wrong, oh
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, oh
We’re going boom boom boom, and that’s the way we live
And in a great big room, and that’s the way we live
"This Must Be the Place "
Home is where I want to be Pick me up and turn me round I feel numb
- born with a weak heart I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better Make it up as we go along Feet on the ground head in the sky It’s ok I know nothing’s wrong nothing
Hi yo I got plenty of time Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you’re standing here beside me I love the passing of time
Never for money Always for love Cover up and say goodnight say goodnight
Home - is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home - she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place
I can’t tell one from another Did I find you, or you find me? There was a time Before we were born If someone asks, this is where I’II be where I’II be
Hi yo We drift in and out Hi yo sing into my mouth Out of all those kinds of people You got a face with a view
I’m just an animal looking for a home Share the same space for a minute or two And you love me till my heart stops Love me till I’m dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you Cover up the blank spots Hit me on the head Ah, ooh

"Crosseyed and Painless"
Lost my shape Tryin’ to act casual! Can’t stop I might end up in the hospital
Changin’ my shape I feel like an accident They’re back! To explain their experience
Isn’t it weird Sounds too obscure to me Wasting away That was their policy
I'm ready to leave I push the fact in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind I'm lifting my head, looking for danger signs
There was a line There was a formula
Sharp as a knife Facts cut a hole in us
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head looking around inside
The island of doubt It’s like the taste of medicine Working by hindsight Got the message from the oxygen
Ooh I’m making a list Find the cost of opportunity Doing it right, right Facts are useful in emergencies
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head Looking around inside.
Facts are simple and facts are straight Facts are lazy and facts are late Facts all come with points of view Facts don’t do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around Facts are living turned inside out Facts are getting the best of them
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
Can't get the monkey off your back?
Then put it in your mouth...
...with Monkeyshine Beer!
Get it, monkey
Get it, get it, monkey
Monkey, monkey
Monkeyshine Beer.
Because it's a jungle out there!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
But then the guy opens his beer and girls run at him...
...so everything works out okay.
I meant because the monkey reminds me of Marcel.
I can see that.
Because they both have those big brown eyes and the little pouty chin.
And the fact that they're both monkeys?
I wonder if I did the right thing, giving him away.
Ross, you had to. He was humping everything in sight.
My Malibu Barbie will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...
...and when you got it back, there'd be monkey raisins in it?
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...
Suddenly, I had this big
"attitude problem."
The One With the Super Bowl
Hey, check it out!
Guess what I got?
Rhythm?
No. My first fan mail!
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:
I love you and would do anything to have you."
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret admirer, Erika Ford."
Oh, wait.
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes."
In Crazy World, that means you're married.
It's not addressed to Days Of Our
Lives. This came to your apartment.
She was in our building.
Oh, my God.
I got my very own stalker!
You are so lucky, I'm gonna share mine.
Joey, remember we talk about good thing and bad thing. This is a bad thing.
Where are you off to?
There's a paleontology conference in L.A.
So I figured I'd go and drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
He will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...
...and isn't capable of that emotion.
Phoebe? That really cute guy is here again.
Okay, so everyone...
...pretend I'm telling you a story and it's really funny.
So everyone just laugh. Now!
I know, I know!
I'm Rob Donan.
Hi, Rob Donan.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really great.
Anyway, I schedule performers for children's libraries.
And I was thinking, have you thought about playing your songs for kids?
I would love to have kids...
...hear me play the songs that I will write for them.
What do we do for dinner?
We could cook for ourselves.
It's Erika.
My God. The stalker!
Never mind. It's open.
Hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.
But we want a backup plan, just in case she isn't a cartoon!
Let's get out of here!
The one time they're not home!
We'll leave.
When we pass her...
...she won't know me, because we never met!
That's how radio stars escape stalkers!
She's coming!
It's me.
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.
You ready?
Wait, wait, wait!
Erika!
- Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.
You had a question?
I can't find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin...
...answers to the name Marcel?
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Marcel has passed on.
Oh, my God. What happened?
He got sick, and then he got sicker...
...and then he got a little better.
But then he died.
I can't believe this!
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:
"Sometimes monkeys die."
It's not a great saying...
...but it certainly is fitting today.
- Someone should've called me.
- I'm sorry.
Look, I know this can't bring him back...
...but here, it's just a gesture.
Zoo dollars?
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.
It's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
I know.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker!
What is she like?
You remember Kathy Bates in Misery?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
And she's not crazy?
Oh, no, no.
She's a total whack-job.
She thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Oh, my God!
And he's going out with her?
He cannot pursue this.
Just because this woman sees Joey through the magical box...
...in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?
Why are you looking at me? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac!
Are you okay?
No. I'm just nervous.
Maybe if I just picture them all in their underwear...
That's not a good idea. That's the reason the last guy got fired.
I'm used to playing for grownups.
Grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing.
And kids...
...listen.
It's just a huge responsibility.
What?
Are you gonna kiss me?
I was thinking about it.
Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!
Ok! Let's find some seats.
Chandle, we gonna find our seats.
Hold on a second.
He thinks he can.
He thinks he can.
Oh, what the hell.
He can.
- Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
- Hi, Phoebe!
I'm gonna play some songs about grandparents, okay?
Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes
She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike
But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner
And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner
Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru
But the truth is she died
And someday you will too
I will have the great seven, and the doctor, will have the resertal.
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.
What?
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...
...and a while ago you were reattaching Simone's spinal cord.
That was a tricky one.
In reality...
...that operation takes 10 hours.
But they only showed it for 2 minutes.
Who's "they"?
No one.
Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.
Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.
I could just eat them.
But I won't.
Otherwise my watch would fall off.
No, seriously.
These hands...
...these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.
Just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
All right. Just one.
You're good at that.
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!
Is anyone here a doctor?
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!
Dr. Drake Ramoray!
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy being with other men that way.
But, zoo dollars?
It's about your monkey!
It's alive.
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...
...and that was clearly a case of...
..."foodal chokage."
I gotta tell you something
You don't have to tell me anything.
You don't have to explain yourself to me.
Who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?
I should be happy to be near you.
Hey, I
Hey what?
That's it. Just hey!
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!
There'll be times when you get older
When you'll want to sleep with people
Just to make them like you
But don't!
'Cause...
...that's another thing...
...that you don't wanna do
Everybody!
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do
- Excellent!
- Very informative!
Not at all inappropriate!
Thank you for coming, everybody!
There are cookies in the back.
That was great.
The kids loved you.
Yea! I rock!
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.
You were incredible!
But...?
- How'd you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.
It was either "but" or "butter."
The thing is, I think some of the parents...
...they were hoping that...
...you'd play more songs about barnyard animals.
I can do that.
Really?
Because that would be fantastic!
What? You wanna kiss me?
I'm thinking about it.
So by the libery car carticuler, we still have some time.
What, I'm unemploy.
The bat.
Ambassador of darkness.
Flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger.
Sightless specter of the macabre.
Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right.
There was a break-in...
...a few months back.
Inside job.
Your monkey was taken.
The zoo told me that my monkey was dead!
The zoo!
You believe everything the zoo tells you?
That's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they'll say that!
They don't want the bad publicity.
It's all a great big cover-up.
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows?
- Do you have idea who else knows?
- I only know Lipson.
Lipson knows, huh?
Hello, Mr. Possum.
Enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night.
- Taunting gravity
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?
Word on the street
When I say "street," I mean those pretend streets here at the zoo.
Of course.
Your monkey found a new career...
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.
This is unbelievable!
So what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe.
But you already told me everything.
Check it out.
He actually is the Monkeyshine monkey!
What'll you do?
I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find him.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Okay, hi again!
Hi, Phoebe!
Today, we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
Then the farmer hits him
And grinds him up
And that's how we get hamburgers
Now chickens!
Only you who can save her, Drake!
Damn it! I'm a doctor.
I'm not God!
There goes my whole belief system.
It's Erika.
Quick! Shut off the TV.
I wanna see what happens!
I get Leslie out of the coma then we make out.
How can that be?
You were kissing Sabrina!
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neurosurgeon.
Hey, Erika. Come in.
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.
Right, they choppered me in.
What's up?
You're having a little party too!
- Is she here?
- Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two!
I saw you today, kissing in the doctor's lounge.
It's not what you think
You told me I was the only one!
All right, look.
That's it.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.
I should have told you a long time ago...
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh, my God! Do the people at the hospital know?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh, I know! I know!
Where am I?
University Hospital...
...where you've been for the last 18 years.
How can you be here and there?
Because it's a TV show!
What are you getting at?
Nice girl, not great with concept.
I'm not Drake!
That's right!
He's not Drake. He's...
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!
Is this true?
Yes! Yes, it is true!
And I know this...
...because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me!
And then he told me he would run away with me!
And he didn't!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!
Is all this true?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
You deserve much better than me.
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.
Go to Salem. Find him!
He's the guy for you!
Oh, Hans!
Hans?
Hans!
Yo, evil twin!
Right. Goodbye, Erika.
Good luck in Salem.
Take care.
I'll never forget you, Hans.
All right.
The people who threw the water!
Helping you out!
Fired?
Why?
The library board got a lot of complaints from parents...
...about the stuff in your songs.
I can't believe this is the libery!
- I mean, books, freespeech, newspapers on sticks. - I know.
What about the kids.
Did you tell your board that the kids want to hear the truth?
I see.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddy songs?
What do you want me to be?
Like some...
...stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
You don't have to be Barney.
Who's Barney?
I tracked down Marcel and get this.
He's healthy, he's happy...
...and he's in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.
You're kidding!
- This is amazing!
- I know.
I finally get a part on TV, and the monkey's making movies.
Rachel, I'm ready.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is, who tells the truth?
I guess that's me.
She's here!
Sometimes men love women
Sometimes men love men
Then there are bisexuals
Though some just say
They're kidding themselves
This is exciting! I haven't seen my monkey in a year.
What, you never look down in the shower?
I'm not allowed to make one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?
Back up, please.
Back up. Come on.
Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?
I'm sorry.
It's a closed set.
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.
We used to live together.
And I have a time share in the Poconos with Flipper.
There he is!
Hey! Buddy!
Marcel! Marcel!
In the jungle
The mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle
The mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight
Excuse me, this is a
Closed set. We know.
But we're friends with the monkey.
Good morning.
Look who I brought!
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!
Whoa, dude. Burn!
I don't get it.
He seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure, starring in a movie and all.
How big of a star is Marcel?
In human terms? I'd say...
...Cybill Shepherd.
So you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?
Hey, Sal?
Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready.
Excuse me?
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?
- The one in the director's chair?
- Gotcha.
Pheebs, walk with me.
Why am I walking with you?
We're just going over here so that we can get away from...
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!
For the love of God, woman, listen to me!
Is he looking? Is he looking?
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.
I can't do Chris' makeup.
She refuses to acknowledge her mustache.
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.
Unless we convince her to let me bleach it...
...Van Damme will be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.
Excuse me.
Is your name Chandler?
Yes, it is.
Chandler Bing.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I'm Susie Moss.
Fourth grade? Glasses?
I carried a box of animal crackers like a purse?
Susie Moss!
Right! Yeah! Wow!
You look...
Great job growing up.
It's nice to see you don't still wear the cap with the mirrors on it.
I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Remember the class play?
You pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?
Yes. Back then, I used humor as a defense mechanism.
Thank God I don't do that anymore.
What you have been doing since childhood?
Well, I got a new belt.
I wondered!
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.
I didn't know he was in this movie. He is so hot!
You think?
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?
Did you see Time Cop?
No. Was he any good in it?
Rachel, he totally changed time!
So why don't you go talk to him?
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!
Don't!
Tell him I cook!
Excuse me.
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...
...but my friend over there...
...who cooks, by the way...
She thinks you're cute.
You don't think I'm cute?
I don't know.
Do you think you're cute?
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to tell you...
...my friend thinks you're cute.
What should I tell her?
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.
- Makeup!
- That's me. I gotta go.
How many times must I touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?
Well, let's try one more.
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?
I'll be there.
And if things go well, maybe this time...
...I'll get to see your underwear.
No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?
What a jerk!
I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.
Naturally, you know, I said no.
Thanks, anyway.
He just kept asking...
...and asking, asking, asking...
If you want to go out with him, you can.
Sounds like a jerk to me, but
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!
Thank you.
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...
...and we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Oh, man. She's so smokin'!
She's got the greatest set of
No guys around, huh?
- Does anybody need anything?
- I'll have an espresso.
I'll get it.
If I ask you to, you'll end up drinking it yourself.
- That is so unfair.
- I know.
Like you'd drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme?
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.
Marcel's trainer will let me have him for a couple of hours.
You're blowing me off for a monkey?
We can reschedule for Saturday.
Unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Stick a fork in me...
...I am done!
Stick a fork what?
Like when you're cooking a steak.
I don't eat meat.
How do you know vegetables are done?
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
I've met the perfect woman.
We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...
...and then she turns to me and says:
"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"
What did you say?
I believe my exact words were...
How do you know if you wanna do that?
You just know.
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
What I had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes, tops.
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.
But...
...here's an idea.
Have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well, yes, actually...
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.
And there were three of us in there.
I was thinking it would be kind of sexy...
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.
You want me to wear your panties?
Could you?
If I was wearing your underwear...
...then what would you be wearing?
You're swell!
Got the music, got the dinner.
I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...
...with mealworm.
Candle.
What do you think's gonna happen here tonight?
Hi, are you on your way over
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.
It's no big deal.
It's not like I had anything special planned.
- You feel that?
- What?
We passed moment we should stop holding hands.
Rachel, why don't you start talking first?
I feel that this is totally unjustified.
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
If there's something you'd like to share
You had no right to go out with him!
- That's the most ridiculous
- You sold me out!
- I did not!
- You absolutely
Would you let me talk!
Did you just flick me?
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was
That hurt!
Quit flicking!
Stop flicking!
You flicked me first!
Let's not do this!
Happy thoughts!
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
You want me to stop seeing him?
You want me to just tell him you're seeing him instead?
Is that what you want?
That's what you want?
- Fine!
- Fine!
There we go.
If we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Thanks for letting me tag along.
Forget about it.
How you doing there, squirmy?
I'm hanging in.
And a little out.
So assistant to the director?
That's an exciting job. You must have a ton of responsibilities
I don't do the casting.
So what are you guys gonna eat?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth...
...and licking you all over?
Because I went to an all-boys high school, and God is making up for it?
I want you right here...
...right now.
Right now, right here?
Don't you think we're in kind of a public place?
They do have the shrimp.
Meet me in the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Come on.
All right, mister.
Let's see those panties.
Alrighty.
But you know what would be even sexier?
What?
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.
Take your clothes off.
I hope you realize this means we'll miss hearing about the specials.
Come on, hurry!
Do you want this done quick or done right?
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.
Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.
So you want me to clench anything or...?
Susie?
This is for the fourth grade.
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
What do I mean?!
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!
What? What do you mean?
My skirt...
...you lifted. IKids laughing!
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?
Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!
I can't believe this.
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...
...and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Can you beat up that guy?
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.
This is so wild.
I gotta admit, I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Normally, I would not do it.
What made you make the exception for me?
Rachel told me...
...you were dying to have a threesome with me and Drew Barrymore.
By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...
Say you're sorry!
Say it!
No! I'm not gonna!
Say it! Say it!
Great!
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!
Say you're sorry.
You wanna play?
Okay, let's play.
Let's play.
What'll you do?
Give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.
Stop! Stop the madness!
This is crazy!
Who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?
Yes, that's right.
But still...
Look at your purse!
Look at your sweater!
Look at yourselves!
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I'll help you...
...throw out your purse.
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.
I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.
Joey?
Ma?
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.
She took off with my clothes!
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.
I'm wearing panties.
You always wear panties?
No, no. This is the first time.
Talk about your bad luck!
The first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.
Let me see!
No! I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever!
All right, all right!
Someone's flossing!
Joey, some people don't like that.
Chandler's wearing panties.
What?
- Let me see!
- You don't have to see!
Hi, tushy!
One of you give me your underpants.
I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any?
I'm getting heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.
Keep your panties on.
And I'm in the movie!
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!
Marcel just finished his last scene, if you wanna go say goodbye.
That's okay. He's probably got parties to go to and stuff.
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?
Oh, my God!
What?
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way...
...to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so, till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was
Love the way we made it
Looks like we made it
I'm sorry. It has work between you and me. Or you and me.
Drew was very disapoited.
Well, bye for me too.
Okay, we will bye-bye again.
Perhaps the three of us. Just...
Are you sure, I can crush longer with my butt.
No, no, no...
Impressive but no.
Bye, Marcel!
See you on the big screen.
You keep people drinking that beer.
I will miss you buddy.
I think I want to write a song about all this.
Except one of the strings on my guitar is broken.
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
- How long you been waiting to say that? - About 20 minutes!
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!
Cut!
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!
Cut!
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!
Mommy!
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
You're from Baker?
Tell Baker that I told him all that I know already.
Tell him I want to live in peace, understand?
There is no use to go on tormenting me!
I know nothing at all about that case of coins.
Now that gold has disappeared, but if he'd listened... we could have avoided this altogether.
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.
They couldn't uncover any more.
I can't tell Baker what happened to the money.
Go back and tell him that.
Word's around you had a visitor... and Baker knows it.
Name of Jackson.
Well...
Jackson was here... or Baker's got it all wrong.
He's not wrong.
Maybe Baker would like to know just what you and Jackson had to say... about the cash box.
That's not what I'm being paid for.
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.
Why do you think Jackson may be assuming another name?
I would have found him already.
When I start off to find somebody,
I find him.
That's why they pay me.
What is Baker paying you?
That your family?
Yes.
Nice family.
What does he pay you for murdering me?
Five hundred dollars... to get the name.
The name.
Carson. Bill Carson.
That's what he calls himself now.
That's a lot of money... 1,000.
A thousand dollars?
And some in gold. That's a tidy sum.
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.
It's you.
Any information?
Too much.
He said quite a bit that should interest you... and one or two things that interested me.
Such as?
The name Jackson's hiding under is Bill Carson.
That's your bit.
Keep talking.
He also mentioned something about a certain cash box... which just happened to disappear.
- That's my bit.
- Anything else?
Not enough for you, eh?
Well, you don't have to worry.
He won't say anything to anybody again.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.
Here you are.
Here. This is for you.
You did a good job for me.
Worth $500.
Yeah. I almost forgot.
He gave me a thousand.
I think his idea was that I kill you.
But you know the pity is, when I'm paid,
I always follow my job through.
- You know that.
- No! Angel Eyes...
No. No pistol, amigo.
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.
You know you've got a face beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
Yeah.
But you don't look like the one who'll collect it.
A couple steps back.
Thank you.
How much are you worth now?
How much?
Two thousand dollars.
- That's right... $2,000.
- Yeah.
You'll pay for this!
I hope you end up in a graveyard... with the cholera and the rabies and the plague!
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
Put me down!
I hope your mother ends up in a two-dollar whorehouse! Cut me loose!
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
Let me go!
I think I feel sick.
The blood is bursting through my...
I'm dry, Blondie.
Water.
You swine! You son of a bitch!
Let me go!
You're brave with a man who's tied up! Come back!
Come back and fight! You bastard.
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.
Cut it out! Cut it out!
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...
So, you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?
- Me?
- Yeah, it's you.
Me? Who says so? You can't even read.
Yeah, roll it up. Roll it up.
I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies and all who gave birth to you.
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!
Judas! You sold my hide!
But you won't enjoy any of that money... not a penny.
If there's justice in the world, every penny will go to the undertakers.
You know who you are?
You want to know whose son you are?
You don't, I do. Everybody does.
You're the son of a thousand fathers, all bastards like you.
And your mother... Your mother!
She's... You bastard!
Your mother... it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

"passing counterfeit money and, contrary to the laws of this state...
"the condemned is guilty...
"of using marked cards and loaded dice."
Therefore, according to the powers vested in us... we sentence the accused here before us...
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...
- Known as "The Rat."
- and any other aliases he might have... to hang by the neck until dead.
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.
Five for you. One, two... three, four, five for me.
Five for you... and five for me.
Know how much you're worth now?
- No. How much?
There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend... those with a rope around their neck, and the people who have the job of cutting.
Listen, the neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks... so the next time, I want more than half.
You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting.
If we cut down my percentage...
Cigar?
It's liable to interfere with my aim.
But if you miss, you had better miss very well.
Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive... he understands nothing about Tuco.
Nothing.
"Wanted in 15 counties of this state.
"The condemned standing before us..." sitting before us...
"Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...
"has been found guilty by the Third
District Circuit Court of the following:
"murder, assaulting a justice of the peace...
"raping a virgin of the white race...
"statutory rape of a minor of the black race...
"derailing a train in order to rob the passengers...
"bank robbery, highway robbery...
"robbing an unknown number of post offices, breaking out..."
- What'd you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book... an armed unit escorting a cash box of gold coins meets a Yankee ambush... and only three of them are saved:
Stevens, Baker and Jackson.
The thing that wasn't saved, though, was the coins.
But then the army decides, of course... it ought to hold a hearing, and Jackson's acquitted.
- He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
- I know his name.
But you don't know just who you're looking for, and I do.
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.
Where is Carson?
All I know is Carson reenlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.
He lives with a girl called Maria who'll tell you.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
- Where's she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?
Someplace fairly near.
Santa Ana.
Adios, half-soldier.
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey!
"...and the sheriff's office in Sonora.
"The condemned hired himself out as a guide to a wagon train.
"After receiving his payment in advance, he deserted the wagon train...
"on the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians."
Glad they got him... a man guilty of all those crimes.
People with ropes around their necks don't always hang.
What do you mean?
"The condemned is also guilty..."
Even a filthy beggar like that has got a protecting angel.
- "...as a Mexican general."
- A golden-haired angel watches over him.
"For all these crimes the accused has made...
"a full, spontaneous confession.
"Therefore, we condemn him to be hung by the neck until dead."
May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.
Let's get the hell out of here!
What are you trying to say... anybody can miss a shot?
Nobody misses when I'm at the end of the rope.
You've never had a rope around your neck. I'll tell you something.
When that rope starts to pull tight, you can feel the devil bite your ass.
Yeah, you're right. It's getting tougher.
The way I figure, there's not too much future with a sawed-off runt like you.
What do you mean?
'Cause I don't think you'll ever be worth more than $3,000.
What do you mean?
I mean, our partnership is untied.
Oh, no. Not you. You remain tied.
I'll keep the money, and you can have the rope.
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
- Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
- The way back to town is only 70 miles.
You know, if you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.
You filthy bastard! Come here!
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse, you filthy coward!
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
I'll scalp you! I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!
You pig! You vulture!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.
Where are you going? Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.
You wouldn't leave me here.
Come back! Wait! Blondie!
Listen, Blondie...
I believe madam is home.
Sweet dreams, and many thanks from the Seventh Cavalry!
You filthy rats!
Maria.
Honey? Is that you, Bill?
Who are you? What do you want with me?
Go on talking about Bill Carson.
I don't know him.
You were calling to him in the dark.
Where is he?
What are you going to do to him?
I'll ask the questions.
Where is he?
Where is he? Where?
That's enough!
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago... and went away with his unit... they all left.
Which company? Where'd they go?
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.
That's all I know, I swear!
But, but...
I'm very sorry, but the store's closing.
- Revolvers.
- Yeah, revolvers.
Revolvers.
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.
Here. Remington, Colt... a Roat, Smith-Wesson...
Colt... Navy...
Joslyn... another Remington.
- And this one is...
- That's enough.
Cartridges.
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.
Let's go.
Move. Move.
Cartridge.
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.
No.
Fifty dollars.
How much?
A hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
It's all I've got.
Here.
Come here.
This morning I heard the whole thing.
They say that Colonel Canby's closing in with his Northerners... and no later than tomorrow that they'll be in the city.
That's why these Southerners are getting out.
You see, as soon as these cowards hear a Blue Shirt's around, they run.
- These Rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.
They'll soon be finished.
We get rid of these bastards, then we begin making money on those Yankees.
They carry gold, not paper dollars, and they're going to beat the South.
Look. See that one with the white beard sitting in the wagon?
General Sibley. He looks dead.
He's finally getting out of our hair.
Hurray for Dixie!
Where's the owner of that horse?
- Please, sir, a bad heart condition...
- Where?
The war has frightened me already.
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig. Where is he now?
You leave him be.
He doesn't know who rides every horse.
You stay quiet, old hen.
Upstairs. Upstairs in room four, señor.
Hear that?
You rotten criminals. How dare you?
Your spurs.
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend... those that come in by the door... and those that come in by the window.
Take off that pistol belt.
It's empty.
Mine isn't.
Even when Judas hanged himself, there was a storm too.
That could be cannon fire.
Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you.
You ever see this before, my friend?
Throw it over the roof beam.
That's it.
Now get on that.
That's right.
Now make sure the rope is tight.
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.
Now put the rope around your neck.
That's very good.
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.
I have another system... a little different than yours.
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool.
Welcome, my friend.
If you're looking for a summer vacation spot, you've found it.
Our hotel is luxurious and filled with conveniences.
And the attractions don't stop there.
International cuisine, healthful and nutritious food.
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.
Our government has spared no expense.
As you can see, we are treated very well.
Have you ever heard of anyone by the name of Bill Carson?
And you? Have you ever heard of someone named Canby? No?
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel who decided to tear us to pieces.
The only thing we care about is saving our own hides.
And you ask me if I know someone.
I just don't know what you drifters could be thinking.
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.
If he's with the Third, they've already left.
For Glorieta.
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.
And the desert lies ahead of them. I really doubt that any of them are still alive.
And what if they were still alive?
Worse.
Well, then, you must not have heard anything about Batterville.
It's one of those Yankee prison camps you'd better hope you never end up in.
Keep it. It's yours.
"We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson...
"guilty of the following crimes:

"...we have condemned the aforementioned Thomas Larson...

"to hang by the neck until dead."
May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed.
Sorry, Shorty.
Move. Come on, let's go.
I don't know. As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.
Burns, huh? They say people with fair skin can't take too much.
Like that, you won't have to carry so much.
Where we going?
Where? Where I'm going, amigo.
Over that way.
Another hundred miles of beautiful, sunbaked sand.
Even the armies are afraid to march through there.
Sibley's men are retreating up there.
Canby's men are coming here.
But no one will set foot in this hell... except you and me.
One hundred miles... that's a nice walk.
What was it you told me the last time?
"If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it."
And if you won't manage it, you'll die, only slowly... very slowly, old friend.
After you, please. Start walking.
Taking a rest?
Come on, Blondie.
We don't have very far to go.
Only 70 miles.
Only eight and a half hours more before sunset.
That's not too bad.
Come on.
Okay, let's eat.
That is, I'll eat.
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.
You want some water?
Drink. Drink.
Come on. Come on.
Well, Blondie. So long.
And so, Blondie... it's good-bye.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, boy.
Easy, easy.
Easy, easy. Attaboy. That's nice.
Water. Water.
200,000 in gold.
It's yours. Just get me water.
What's that you say?
Who the hell are you?
Carson.
My name is Bill Carson now. It's Carson.
Surprise attack.
All dead. My name is Jackson, not Carson.
Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What did you say about the dollars?
200,000... all mine.
Was the Third Cavalry's.
Baker has nothing.
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.
Where? Where, here?
Here? Talk!
- Huh?
- In the cemetery.
- Which cemetery?
- The one... on Sad Hill.
There's a grave by...
Which grave?
Have a name? Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.
There's no number. There's a name.
- Huh?
- It's written...
Yes?
Water!
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.
In the grave. Okay.
But it must have a name or a number on it, huh?
There must be a thousand, five thousand!
Don't die, huh?
Don't die. I'll get you water.
Stay there. Don't move. I'll get you water.
Don't die until later, you son of a...
Get away from there!
- He's dead.
- Yeah.
I'll kill you.
If you do that, you'll always be poor... just like the greasy rat that you are.
If I were you, I'd keep me alive.
What did he tell you, huh?
- A name.
- Huh?
- A name on a grave.
- What name?
Blondie, don't die.
Blondie, don't die. I'm your friend.
Please don't die. Please!
I'm your friend. Come on.
I'll help you. I'll help you.
Don't move. I'll be right back.
Here's the water. Don't die like that pig.
Hey, Blondie, here's water. Water, Blondie.
Don't drink, don't drink.
Is no good for you.
Feel better?
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please, don't die.
Hey, open up! Open up! Hurry!
Settle down. Settle down. Who's there?
What do you mean, "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?
If I were a Yankee, you wouldn't have time to ask me that.
Come on.
Sergeant, listen to this corporal for a moment.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man here, if he's not dead already.
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.
- What happened?
- It was a trap.
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and traveling papers.
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
Third Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron, arriving from San Rafael. Is that enough?
Are you reading when this man is dying?
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw and you're looking for an infirmary?
If you want one, you'll have to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.
- Apache Canyon?
- Apache Canyon.
Is a Mission San Antonio around here?
Sure, 18 miles south. Take him there.
The brothers take care of any wounded, no matter what the color of his uniform.
And keep your eyes open, the area is full of Yankees.
Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.
Take care.
- I've got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds here.
Let him have yours.
- Where's Pablo Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez.
He's away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.
Well, it doesn't matter. For the moment, we take very good care of my friend.
And may God be praised.
In case you didn't know it,
God is on our side too... because He hates the Yanks, huh, Blondie?
Blondie? Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.
- You're heavy.
There.
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
Put him in my cell.
Easy.
- Out, soldier. Out you go. Come on.
- Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me.
Hey, Father, I...
Father, did he speak? Did he say anything?
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything, Father?
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.
He should regain his strength in a very short time.
Thank you, Father. You don't know how much this boy's life means to me.
Thanks be to Jesus. Thanks to all of you.
Hey, Blondie.
The old father tells me you'll be up and around in a few days.
You're very lucky to have me so close when it happened.
Think if you'd been on your own.
Look, I mean, when... when one is ill... it's good to have somebody close by... friends or relations.
Do you have parents, Blondie? A mother?
Not even a mother.
No one?
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
We're all alone in the world.
I have you, you have me.
Only for a little while, I mean.
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.
We could have all that money in our hands.
I must tell you the truth.
In my place, you would do the same thing.
It's all over for you now.
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
God help me. It's my fault.
Mine, mine, mine.
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear... in my place... in your place,
I would do the same thing.
I would tell about the gold. Yes, I would.
I'd tell the name on the grave.
After all, what good is the money to you if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery, but you know how many graves are there?
Please, Blondie.
Please, have a little, huh? Here. Coffee.
Please, tell me the name... on the grave.
If I get my hands on the $200,000...
I'll always honor your memory.
I swear, I'll always honor your memory.
Come closer.
Tell me.
Why, you dirty...
I'll sleep better... knowing my good friend is by my side... to protect me.
"Tuco, water." Here's water.
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water.
All right, you dirty skunk, get your ass off the bed.
Come on, the party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.
From the way the wounded are pouring into this place, we better leave... before we get caught up in the war.
- Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
- Yeah.
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
- Where, this way?
- Yes.
Don't you recognize me?
It's me, Tuco. Let me embrace you.
I don't know the right thing.
I was just passing by here,
I said to myself...
"I wonder if my brother remembers his brother."
Did I do wrong?
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
You have seen me, Tuco.
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
Oh, my uniform!
It's a long story.
But let's talk about you.
It's more important. You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but... you were always thin, eh, Pablito?
What about our parents?
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.
Nine years?
So it's nine years. Nine years!
Our mother has been dead a long time now.
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.
He asked for you to be there, but there was only me.
And you?
Outside of evil, what else have you managed to do?
It seems to me you once had a wife someplace.
Not one. Lots of them.
One here, one there, wherever I found them.
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
What good would that be?
Just keep on the way you're going.
Go away.
- And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go, I'll go.
While I'm waiting for the Lord to remember me...
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother Ramirez... will tell you something.
You think you're better than I am.
Where we came from, if one didn't want to die of poverty... one became a priest or a bandit.
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder!
You talk about Mother and Father.
You remember, when you left to become a priest, I stayed behind.
I must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but I stayed.
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I will tell you something.
You became a priest because you were too much of a coward to do what I do.
Tuco.
Please forgive me, brother.
Ah, my belly's full.
Nice guy, my brother.
I didn't tell you my brother was in charge here?
Everything. Like the pope almost.
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah, yeah, my brother, he say to me...
"Stay, brother. Don't go home.
We never see each other.
"Here there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."
Whenever we see each other, he never lets me go. It's always the same story.
My brother... he is crazy about me.
That's so. Even a tramp like me, no matter what happens...
I know there's a brother somewhere who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
Sure.
Well, after a meal, there's nothing like a good cigar.
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.
That sure is a long way.
Here to the northwest, through all of Texas...
- After that...
- Then what?
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?
Those men aren't worried about anything anymore, are they?
But since I'm alive and I've noticed we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times.
I thought you might tell me where we're going.
Towards $200,000.
Is that good enough for you?
Whoa.
Hey, wake up, you.
- The troops are coming. Come on.
- Blue or gray?
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.
Hoorah! Hoorah for the Confederacy!
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!
- Hoorah for General... what's his name?
- Lee.
Lee!
God is with us because He hates the Yanks too!
God's not on our side
'cause He hates idiots also.
Hut, two, three, four.
Prisoners of war, forward!
March!
Halt!
Left face!
Form a single file. Move!
- Jonathan Frost!
- Present!
- Richard McGilley!
- Present!
- Nathaniel Sullivan!
- Present.
- Robert Clark!
- Present.
- Sam Richmond!
- Present.
Bill Carson.
I said Bill Carson!
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
Bill Carson!
Yeah, that's me.
Please, Carson... answer "present."
What are you, deaf?
Now suppose you say "present," Carson.
I like big fat men like you.
When they fall, they make more noise... and sometimes they never get up.
Wallace... that's enough.
Sergeant!
The captain wants to see you right away.
Be sure these two get good treatment.
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.
Yeah.
For the last time, Sergeant...
I'm telling you, I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.
No more brutality.
There's hundreds of prisoners out there and only a few men to guard them.
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.
I think that you'll manage to gain their respect by treating them better.
Are our men treated that well in Andersonville camp?
I don't give a goddamn what they do in Andersonville.
While I'm in charge here, the prisoners are not to be tortured... or cheated or murdered.
That an accusation?
Sergeant, gangrene is eating my leg away, not my eyes.
I know the prisoners here are being robbed systematically.
I know there's scum around who are bivouacked near the camp... waiting for someone to deliver this loot.
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't permit any such trickery. Am I clear?
Yes, sir... just as long as you're the commandant.
Yes, Sergeant.
I know this leg means
I won't last very long... but I pray I can manage to have enough time to amass evidence... and bring to a court-martial... all those who discredit and dishonor... the uniform of the Union.
I wish you luck.
You and the others better lay low for a few days.
No, I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.
Listen, Angel Eyes said for us to lay low for a few days... but we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things.
Come on, saddle your horses.
Get in.
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.
There's no formalities here.
It's been a long time.
You're hungry. Sit down, eat.
I knew it, I knew it.
The minute I saw you, I said to myself...
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes.
"I'll bet he got himself an easy job...
"and he never forgets a friend."
I never forget old friends, Tuco.
- Right.
- It's good to see old friends again.
Good.
Especially when they've come from so far away... and have so much to talk about.
And you do have a lot to talk about, haven't you?
You were captured near Fort Craig.
Well, if you were with Sibley, that means then that you... were coming from Santa Fe.
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Very hard.
Especially if you don't have anything to drink.
Why are you going under the name of Bill Carson now?
One name is as good as another.
Not wise to use your own name.
Like you. I'll bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.
Sergeant Angel Eyes.
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
Music? Yes, it's very good... very good for the digestion.
So...
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
That fake too?
Bill Carson's name's written in it.
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
More feeling.
Was Carson dead or alive when you found him?
What'd he tell you about the money?
I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.
How's your digestion now?
You'd better talk.
I have nothing to tell you.
Play that fiddle, you!
You can sure consider yourself much luckier than your pal.
Wallace will punch your friend as long as the song goes.
So many of us have had a session in there.
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.
What did he say about the money?
It's buried in a grave.
- Where?
- Sad Hill...
Sad Hill Cemetery.
Which grave?
I don't know. I don't know, I tell you.
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name on the grave.
Put those clothes on.
- Why?
- We're going for a ride.
- Where?
- To find $200,000.
I know the name of the cemetery now... and you know the name of the grave.
You're not gonna give me the same treatment?
Would you talk?
No, probably not.
That's what I thought.
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco... but you're smart enough to know that talking won't save you.
And Tuco... is he...
Not yet.
But he's in very good hands.
You've changed partners, but you still got the same deal.
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
There's two of us. it should make it easier than just one.
Yeah.
Hold it. That's it, don't move.
Now don't breathe. Still. That's it.
Got it. Thank you.
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?
To hell, with a rope around his neck and a price on his head.
$3,000, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.
I'll bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.
I told you once, friend, if I ever get you down... you're gonna need a lot of help to get up again.
You're a lot luckier than that one.
Grub, a rope, and you're all finished.
And there isn't any partner this time to shoot you down.
If your friends stay out in the damp, they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?
Or a bullet.
Hear that, boys? Come on out here.
Since we're all going in the same direction, might as well go together.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six... Perfect number.
Isn't three the perfect number?
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.
Sure would like to put your paw on it, huh?
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been shaken up on this train nearly ten hours now.
You smell like a pig already... but let's not try to make things any worse.
Get going.
I can't while you're watching me.
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?
You don't want to break our friendship, huh? Well, I'll break it.
Halt.
Take your places.
Ready!
Aim! Fire!
Slim, take care of the horses.
I've been looking for you for eight months.
Whenever I should've had a gun in my right hand, I thought of you.
Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me.
I had lots of time to learn how to shoot with my left.
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.
Every gun makes its own tune.
It's perfect timing, Large One.
Clem, follow him.
Just a minute. I'll be right there.
Just give me a little time to get dressed, and I'll open up.
Put your drawers on and take your gun off.
How the hell did you get out of that pigsty?
My own way. I'm here with your old friend, Angel Eyes.
You talked, you traitor. You talked.
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.
You, me...
So only you know your half of the secret?
I'm very happy you're working with me... and we're together again.
I get dressed,
I kill him and be right back.
Oh, listen...
I forgot to mention...
He's not alone. There's five of them.
- Five?
- Yeah, five of them.
So that's why you came to Tuco?
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
They shot him at close range.
Well, look who's here.
The other one will be along.
They'll come looking for us.
Watch out.
There's two of them.
I want that blond alive.
You, back there. Come on, let's go.
Were you gonna die alone?
Halt!
- Angel Eyes is mine, huh?
- All right.
"See you soon..."
"Idiots."
It's for you.
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
Like a cemetery, for instance?
There should be a bridge across that river.
- We'd better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.
I got a good sense of where I'm going.
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way...
Gentlemen.
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.
Come along now. Follow me.
We found them near the perimeter, sir.
- Where do you hail from?
- Illinois.
- And you?
- I'm with him.
Any reason for being around here?
We want to enlist, General.
You better learn to distinguish rank.
I'm a captain.
Get the hell out.
It sure as hell might be you today, so go write your will.
Yes, sir.
So you want to enlist?
You gotta take a test to prove it.
Well, show me.
You've got a career. At the least,
I'd say you'll make colonel.
- Really?
- Sure.
Like it says in the manual...
"You've got every qualification...
"to become an expert in the use of weapons."
For this, sir, is the most potent weapon in war.
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.
Volunteers.
You want to enlist, hmm?
Let's go.
Come on, gentlemen. Come on.
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're still in time.
Whoever has the most liquor to get the soldiers drunk and send them to be slaughtered... is the winner.
We and the ones over on the other side of the river only have one thing in common.
All of us reek of alcohol.
What did you say your name was?
And you?
No.
Names don't matter.
Yes, because soon you can join the gallant heroes of Branson Bridge.
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?
Sure, the Rebs have decided that damn bridge... is the key to this whole area.
Stupid, useless bridge.
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
And headquarters has declared we must take that ridiculous flyspeck... even if all of us are killed.
Otherwise, the key will get rusty... and just be a spot on the wall.
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.
Intact is how the South wants it... and we want it intact too.
You'll all turn to dust... but one thing is sure, boys:
Branson Bridge will stand unbroken.
Is it bad to speak the way I do to volunteers?
I've done a lot worse.
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!
In here, I've destroyed it all.
It's a court-martial offense to imagine... to dream of blowing it up... a serious crime.
Even to think of destroying that bridge is just...
Why not really blow it up, Captain?
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.
I've been dreaming about it.
I've even worked out a plan.
I sure have.
The best time is after the attack... when there's a truce to get the wounded.
If I could do it...
I could save many thousands of men.
But what I lack is the guts.
They're beginning their daily slaughter right on time.
Captain, all companies are awaiting your orders.
Be right there.
Let's go.
All right, friends... come along and enjoy the spectacle.
Companies, report!
Company B ready!
Company E ready!
Company D ready!
Companies, forward!
It looks like the captain is really asking for a bullet in his guts.
Yeah.
I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.
I have a feeling it's really gonna be a good long battle.
- Blondie?
- Huh?
The money's on the other side of the river.
Where?
Amigo, I said the other side, and that's enough.
But while the Confederates are there, we can't get across.
What would happen if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
Yeah.
Then these idiots would go somewhere else to fight.
Maybe.
Doctor, quick, the captain's wounded.
Hurry, a stretcher.
Easy. Easy now.
Get things ready.
A little of this will help.
Take a slug of this, Captain.
Keep your ears open.
What are you doing? No, leave me alone.
You realize we might be risking our lives.
Yeah, and if I get killed... you'll never get your hands on all that beautiful money.
Yeah, Tuco... it sure would be a pity.
Doc.
Doctor... could you help me live a little more?
I expect good news.
Why don't we tell each other our half of the secret?
- Why don't we?
- Huh? You go first.
No, I think it's better that... you start.
All right.
The name of the cemetery is...
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.
The name on the grave is...
Arch Stanton.
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.
It'll be a lot easier with that.
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
Dig.
You're not digging.
If you shoot me, you won't see a cent of that money.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause there's nothing in there.
Why, you son of a...
You thought I'd trust you?
$200,000 is a lot of money.
We're gonna have to earn it.
How?
I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone.
The gun.
You pig. You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?
Last night.
You see, in this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend... those with loaded guns... and those who dig.
- You dig.
- Where?
Here.
There's no name on it!
There's no name here either.
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.
It was the grave marked "Unknown"... right beside Arch Stanton.
Go ahead.
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
Now I want you to stand up there and put your head in that noose.
Well, now, seems just like old times.
Four for you... and four... four for me.
Blondie!
Hey, Blondie!
You know what you are?
Just a dirty son of a bitch!
Hey!
If you want any tickets, you'll have to go around to the front of...
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.
What the hell am I doing around here?
They walk in here and...
Let's see. I hope I got...
Three?
That'll be $7...
...and 50 cents.
No.
Frank?
Frank sent us.
Did you bring a horse for me?
Well, looks like we're...
Looks like we're shy one horse.
You brought two too many.
Hey, Pa!
Look!
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.
Timmy.
Maureen, look.
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.
And don't touch the apple pie or the roast.
Patrick's already left for the station, huh?
He's getting ready, Pa.
-Damn it, Patrick!
-Coming, Pa.
Not bad, I'd say.
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?
But these are the same slices as usual.
Yeah, sure.
As usual.
Maureen.
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices as big as a door if you want to.
You'll have beautiful new clothes and you won't have to work no more.
We're going to get rich, Pa?
Who knows?
Patrick!
Wait a minute!
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.
The train will come in and there won't be no one to meet your mother.
Our mother died six years ago.
Go now, or you'll really be late.
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.
She's young and she's pretty and she's a lady.
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress
"and the same straw hat that I was wearing when we met."
I'm gonna get some fresh water from the well.
Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
And down the mountain side
The summer's gone
And all the roses fall.-.
Maureen!
What are we gonna do with this one, Frank?
Now that you've called me by name...
I saw some mighty fine stock down south.
Is that so?
And the prices are good.
-These your valises, ma'am?
-Yes.
-Come, Sarah.
-Bring them other two.
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?
-Was yesterday.
-Why didn't you tell your brother?
-Hiya, Gramps.
-Hiya, Bill. We're back again.
Come on. Get a move on, will you?
Get the lead out of your asses, you redskin warriors.
I got a whole train to unload.
All right, chuck down those feed sacks first.
Come on! Come on!
What's the name of the place you wanted to go?
Sweetwater.
Brett McBain's farm.
McBain? Yeah, sure.
That stubborn redheaded Irishman, tilling sand for years way out there in the middle of nowhere.
Sweetwater!
Only a loony like him could call that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.
Sweetwater!
That's good! Sweetwater!
That's right. A little more to the right.
Higher. Higher.
Hold it there.
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.
They caught up with us again, eh, Lafayette? Let's go!
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!
Hey, boys! Watch out!
Watch out down there!
Slow down!
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.
Don't the train stop?
What can I do for you, ma'am?
I would like some water, if it's no trouble.
Water?
Well, you see, that word is poison around these parts ever since the days of the great flood.
-You mean you never wash?
-We sure do!
I'd like to use the same facilities you people do.
You sure can.
Just happen to have a full tub in the back.
And you're lucky.
Only three people have used it this morning.
Used it one at a time or all together?
I can tell you're accustomed to fine living.
Bet you come from one of those big eastern cities.
-New Orleans.
-New Orleans!
-You've been there?
-No.
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.
You know, she...
Jug.
Do you only know how to play or do you know how to shoot?
Do you know how to blow music from that?
Pick it up.
You!
You don't know how to play.
Try this one.
Take it.
Go on.
Here.
Bravo.
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.
It's all right. You're right on time.
To bury my escort.
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.
Hey.
The gun.
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?
I saw three of these dusters a short time ago.
They were waiting for a train.
Inside the dusters, there were three men.
So?
Inside the men, there were three bullets.
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.
For two reasons.
One, nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's men.
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.
That surprise you?
Yeah.
Well, you know music.
And you can count.
All the way up to two.
All the way up to six, if I have to.
And maybe faster than you.
Yeah, go on.
Play, Harmonica.
Play, so you can't bullshit.
Only, watch those false notes.
Like so?
And so, this cousin of mine keeps writing me to come on down to New Orleans.
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.
It's too full of fast men and loose women.
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.
Now, I'm too used to a quiet, simple country life.
He's Timmy.
Yes.
Dear God.
On the day...
On the very day of your wedding.
Poor little miss.
Mrs...
Mrs. McBain.
But we all... But we thought...
I know.
It was to be a surprise today.
Brett McBain and I were married.
A month ago.
In New Orleans.
"I am the resurrection, and the life.
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
Amen.
-Mr. Bennett!
-What's he doing here?
I found this collar on a nail by the door.
You got no way of knowing, but this is as good as a signature.
Cheyenne's hand.
-But why?
-Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.
We'll make them tell us before we hang them.
Let's get moving.
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.
No, Sam.
You go back.
You don't want to stay out here alone.
Why not?
This is my home.
You know, Wobbles,
I'm kind of mad at you.
Frank wasn't there.
He sent three friends.
I don't know nothing, I swear.
I only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it.
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.
-I swear to you that I...
-'Cause he was at the McBains'.
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.
Everyone knows that. We got proof.
That was always one of Frank's tricks.
Faking evidence.
I don't know.
I swear.
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.
I don't know nothing.
Who's there?
Did you make coffee?
Make it.
Didn't sleep a wink.
A pack of turds dressed in black rode herd on me the whole damn night.
Yeah, but I left them in the middle of the desert.
If they're lucky, they'll be home in three days.
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.
They want to hang me, the big black crows.
Idiots.
What the hell?
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.
Be like killing a priest.
A Catholic priest, that is.
Yeah, the world is full of people who hate Cheyenne.
See, I ain't the mean bastard people make out.
Of course, if somebody had a mind to kill me, it fires me up.
And a fired-up Cheyenne ain't a nice thing to see.
Especially for a lady.
But you're too smart to make him mad.
So this here's where I was supposed to do all the killing?
Yeah.
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.
Now, if somebody gets dressed up to look like me, so they can hang this thing around my neck,
I don't like it none.
But I can understand it.
What I don't understand is why.
Neither do I.
But I see you looked a lot for the why.
Yeah.
What if there were a whole heap of whys?
Round. Yellow.
You know the kind.
You rap them on a stone and they go "ding."
Maybe.
But I didn't find them.
By the way, you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica?
He's somebody you'd remember.
Instead of talking, he plays.
And when he'd better play, he talks.
You know, ma'am, when you've
Killed four, it's easy to make it five.
Sure. You're an expert.
Ma'am, it seems to me you ain't caught the idea.
Of course I have.
I'm here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money.
If you want to, you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself.
And even call in your men.
Well, no woman ever died from that.
When you're finished, all I'll need will be a tub of boiling water, and I'll be exactly what I was before.
With just another filthy memory.
You make good coffee, at least?
Not bad.
Congratulations.
Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?
I only told you to scare them.
People scare better when they're dying.
And can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre?
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.
I have no time for surprises, Frank.
You know that.
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic, and before my eyes rot,
I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.
I know where you got on board.
I was there, too, remember?
"To remove small obstacles from the track," you said.
Well, there were a few.
But we traveled a long way, just the same.
And fast.
Even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast.
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.
I knew you when you were just barely limping.
I watch that dry rot rise a little more every day.
Any normal man would put a bullet in his brain.
But you, you just got a little more hasty.
Otherwise you ain't changed any.
I'd say you've changed, Frank.
A lot.
You used to take care of certain things personally.
Now, you're keeping in the background.
You'll end up giving orders.
It's because, now, I don't want to leave you alone too much.
You're gonna need somebody more and more every day to stay near you.
-Like a friend.
-Or like a partner.
How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?
It's almost like holding a gun.
Only much more powerful.
You see, staying with you,
I'm beginning to think big, too.
This McBain business has given me ideas.
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.
You'll never succeed in becoming like me.
Why?
Because there are many things you'll never understand.
This is one of them.
You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons.
And the only one that can stop that is this.
Now, shall we get back to our little problem?
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.
Pretty soon the widow McBain won't be a problem no more.
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.
"From now on, there are no more surprises."
And then you happen to meet a man like this, who looked like a good man.
Clear eyes, strong hands.
And he wants to marry you.
Which doesn't happen often.
And he says he's rich, too, which doesn't hurt.
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.
"Now I'll say yes and go live in the country.
"I wouldn't mind giving him half a dozen kids after all.
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.
Even if he's going to have a job pulling you out of the devil's grip.
Still, I swear he'd left money around someplace.
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.
Minus a husband and plus a great future.
You deserve better.
The last man who told me that is buried out there.
You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother.
She was the biggest whore in Alameda and the finest woman that ever lived.
Whoever my father was, for an hour or for a month, he must have been a happy man.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
What do you want?
Cheyenne's right.
Once you've killed four, it's easy to make it five.
This isn't the time to leave.
Give me some water-
From the well.
I like my water fresh.
When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.
A sound? Like what?
Like that.
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.
Morning, Mrs. McBain.
-What brings you to town?
-Good morning.
Maybe you don't remember, but yesterday at the funeral...
I remember very well.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes.
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.
Why is everybody hounding me about this guy Frank?
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.
I got my own worries, and all I want is to be left in peace.
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.
You were told not to come here for any reason.
Whatever business you have with Frank, keep it far away from here.
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton, but when I heard that woman say she knew everything,
I thought that the important thing was for me to come over here right away and tell you about it.
You never thought it wasn't a trick?
Sure, but you know that I'm mighty careful, Frank.
No one could have followed me.
That's the first thing I learned, working for you.
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.
You should learn to live as if you didn't exist.
You've known me a long time, Frank.
You know you can trust me.
Wobbles.
How can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?
The man can't even trust his own pants.
Let's get out of here.
The end of the line.
Yeah.
Get him on board.
Tie him up.
Wait, Frank.
I didn't. ..
So, nobody followed you?
No. You gotta believe me.
So, this is the way I can trust you.
I can explain. I didn't know that he...
-Get out.
-No. No. No, Frank.
Get out.
Frank, wait!
I told you to keep quiet.
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?
Someone took care of them.
We found them out at McBain's place.
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank.
First three, then two.
So you're the one who makes appointments.
And you're the one who doesn't keep them.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Dave Jenkins.
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.
Calder Benson.
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.
You ought to know, Frank, better than anyone.
You killed him.
Who are you?
-Who are you, you...
-Frank!
The woman.
We're only losing time.
All right.
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.
Keep him warm for me.
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.
By the way, I want you to keep an eye on that cripple all the time.
-Understand?
-Sure, Frank.
-See anyone?
-No.
There he is.
You only know how to shoot?
Or do you know how to cut, too?
Hey, you.
Wait a minute.
Let's have a good look at you.
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.
It's easy to find you.
Bastard.
I don't have to kill you now.
You leave a slime behind you like a snail.
Two beautiful shiny rails.
There's another bastard.
And he's getting further away every minute.
There it is.
Exactly what your husband ordered from me.
And seeing as how he paid cash on the barrelhead, it all belongs to you.
Oak planks, beech, pine.
All first-grade lumber.
And there's beams and foundation pylons.
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar, and all these tools.
Maybe he wanted to enlarge the farmhouse.
Enlarge the farmhouse?
He could have built at least eight of them.
By the way, ma'am,
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.
Only it seems he forgot to tell me what he wanted printed on it.
Station.
How's that again?
I said print "station."
Looking for this?
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.
I know that woman is here.
I don't want any more useless killing.
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.
To pay what's necessary.
I don't want to waste any more time.
You've made a big mistake, Morton.
When you're not on that train, you look like a turtle out of its shell.
Just funny.
Poor cripple talking big so nobody will know how scared you are.
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.
I don't have time to compete with you.
Compete?
Why, you...
You can't even stand on your own feet by yourself.
Ls that sufficient to make you feel stronger?
I could squash you like a wormy apple.
Sure, but you won't do it.
Because it's not to your advantage.
Who knows how far you'd have gone with two good legs.
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.
Morton. Don't worry about the land.
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.
Of course, it won't make any difference to you dealing with the new owner.
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."
And this one says "corral."
And this here "church."
What the hell is this?
Can't you see?
It's a station.
And all around it, a town.
Brett McBain's town.
Was he crazy!
Yeah, in a very special way.
An Irishman.
He knew, sooner or later, that railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on west.
So he looked over all this country out here until he found this hunk of desert.
Nobody wanted it.
But he bought it.
Then he tightened his belt, and for years, he waited.
Waited for what?
For the railroad to reach this point.
But how in the hell could he be sure the railroad would pass through his property?
Them steam engines can't roll without water.
And the only water for 50 miles west of Flagstone is right here.
Under this land.
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?
He was going to sell this piece of desert for its weight in gold, wasn't he?
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.
Brett McBain wanted his station.
He got the rights to build it.
-How do you know all this?
-I saw a document.
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.
One thing, though.
In very small print, there is a short clause, which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights if, by the time the railroad reaches this point, the station ain't built yet.
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...
Hey.
I noticed the rail gang's already behind those hills.
And before you know it, they're gonna be here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Listen.
Harmonica.
A town built around the railroad.
You could make a fortune, huh?
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Hey, more than that.
Thousands of thousands.
They call them millions.
Millions?
-Yeah, millions.
-Yeah.
I always thought it'd be easier to make a deal with a smart lady.
All you gotta do is...
Hey, what in the hell are you standing around for?
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do?
Build a station, idiots!
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.
But it'll be the first thing she sees when she gets back.
If she gets back.
I think...
Yeah.
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.
You like being alive.
You also like to feel a man's hands all over you.
You like it.
Even if they're the hands of the man who killed your husband.
What a. ..
What a little tramp.
Is there anything in the world you wouldn't do to save your skin?
Nothing, Frank.
Now I understand why they miss you so much down there in New Orleans.
Great invention, the telegraph.
"Jill? The brunette?
"My God, all the customers
"of the most elegant whorehouse on Bourbon Street
"have been weeping ever since she left."
Say, tell me.
Did old McBain know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet he did.
He was just the type to marry a whore.
Hey.
It's an idea.
I could marry you.
And the land would become mine.
And maybe you'd make a perfect wife.
It would be me who wouldn't be any good as a husband.
Too bad.
We'll have to think of another solution.
Simpler.
Quicker.
As sheriff of this county,
I've been asked to preside over the sale by auction of all property belonging to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.
It's free of all encumbrances, liens and mortgages.
This property and all it contains, lock, stock and barrel, will be turned over to the lucky purchaser at the time of sale.
All the contents therein are listed by number on the inventory sheet distributed among you.
The entire property will be sold in block to the highest bidder.
All right. That's clear to everybody.
I declare the auction open.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.
$200. Do I hear more?
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.
Is it, old-timer?
Come on, my friends, $200.
The livestock alone is worth twice that much.
Well...
Who's going to bid $3007
Now, look, friends,
I realize we're not offering
California here, but 200 is damn little for all that property.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.
You're sure you wouldn't want to set a minimum price?
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain, but you're liable to end up selling the place for a plate of beans.
All I want is to sell.
-You look fat, huh?
-If you say so.
-How many?
-One card.
One for me.
Dealer takes three.
Can I... Can I take a hand?
Fifteen.
Yeah, sit down.
I'll deal.
How do you...
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?
It's very simple.
As long as you use your head, you never lose.
Do I hear any other bids?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain, but I think I'm gonna have to knock down on that last bid.
$500 once.
$500 twice.
-You said $5,000?
-It's on its way.
It's Cheyenne!
The reward for this man is $5,000, that right?
Judas was content with $4,970 less.
There were no dollars in them days.
But sons of bitches, yeah.
Hey, wait a minute.
-The jail's that way.
-Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but you're going to the railroad station.
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.
They got a modern jail there.
It's got more walls, more bars, more guards.
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.
One way only.
Here's to you. And congratulations.
You got yourself a good deal.
The auction.
Forget it. I don't invest in land.
You don't look at all like the noble defender of poor defenseless widows.
But then again,
I don't look like a poor defenseless widow.
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.
And you're a remarkable man.
But you have something on your mind.
And you got something on your mind.
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.
Who are you?
Jim Cooper.
Chuck Youngblood.
More dead men.
They were all alive until they met you, Frank.
You paid $5,000 for something that belongs to me.
Plus one.
You've got a right to make a profit, too.
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it, if I were you.
You got yourself into something that's bigger than you are.
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.
You sound like a real businessman, Frank.
Being with Mr. Morton has done you a lot of good.
And you've learned some new methods.
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you a lot of new ways.
Even though you haven't given up the old ones.
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.
Which deal, Frank?
We have more than one, you and me.
We can lump them together into one bundle, settle all of them.
Here and now.
Easy, Frank.
Easy.
You gotta learn not to push things.
Taking it easy is the first thing a businessman should do.
I got an idea Mr. Morton can teach you a lot more.
How much?
Giddy up!
Giddy up!
I could swear we're going to have that strange sound.
Right now.
Time sure flies.
It's already past 12:00.
But... But they were his men.
-Yeah.
-And they tried to kill him.
They must have found somebody who pays better.
And you!
You saved his life.
I didn't let them kill him and that's not the same thing.
Sure.
It's not the same thing.
You get dressed.
It's time to go home.
Did you make coffee?
This time I did.
Good.
My mother used to make coffee this way.
Hot, strong and good.
Cheyenne.
What's he waiting for out there?
What's he doing?
He's whittling on a piece of wood.
I got a feeling when he stops whittling, something's gonna happen.
Surprised to see me here?
I knew you'd come.
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.
Now I understand why.
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.
So you found out you're not a businessman after all?
Just a man.
An ancient race.
Other Mortons will be along and they'll kill it off.
The future don't matter to us.
Nothing matters now.
Not the land, not the money, not the woman.
I came here to see you.
'Cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.
Only at the point of dying.
I know.
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.
Put it there, please.
So I can watch the railroad move up while I shave.
You know what?
If I was you, I'd go down there and give those boys a drink.
You can't imagine how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you.
Just to look at her.
And if one of them should pat your behind, just make believe it's nothing.
They earned it.
Keep your loving brother happy.
Who... Who are you?
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.
But I'm not the right man.
And neither is he.
Maybe not.
But it doesn't matter.
You don't understand, Jill.
People like that have something inside.
Something to do with death.
If that fella lives, he'll come in through that door, pick up his gear and say adiós.
It would be nice to see this town grow.
Now I gotta go.
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.
I hope you'll come back someday.
Someday.
Yeah. I gotta go, too.
Make believe it's nothing.
Sorry, Harmonica.
I gotta stay here.
Who?
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.
I didn't count on that half-man from the train.
He got scared.
Hey, Harmonica.
When they do you in, pray it's somebody who knows where to shoot.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand.
I thought you said no more aches or pains.
No, it's this darned corset.
It binds.
No three-way stretch?
How very un-chic.
You know those police department doctors.
No sense of style.
Well, anyway, tomorrow will be the day.
Why, what's tomorrow?
Tomorrow? The corset comes off tomorrow.
I'll be able to scratch myself like anybody else tomorrow.
I'll throw this miserable thing out the window.
Be a free... I'll be a free man.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
- Mmm. More than you think.
- Really?
What, do you know that from personal experience or...
Please.
What happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Well, what are you going to do once you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life.
But you were the bright, young lawyer that decided he was going to be chief of police someday.
I had to quit.
Why?
Well, it's because of this fear of heights
I have, this acrophobia.
I wake up at night seeing that man fall from the roof, and I try to reach out to him, and... It's just...
It wasn't your fault.
I know. That's what everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained to you...
I know, I know.
I have acrophobia, which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.
Boy! What a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame.
So why quit?
You mean, and sit behind a desk, chair-borne?
Where you belong.
What about my acrophobia?
What about...
Now suppose I'm sitting in this chair, behind the desk. Here's the desk.
And a pencil falls from the desk down to the floor, and I reach down to pick up the pencil.
Bingo! My acrophobia's back.
Oh, Johnny-O.
Well, what'll you do?
Well, I'm not gonna do anything for a while.
You know, don't forget, I'm a man of independent means, as the saying goes.
Fairly independent.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, why don't you go away for a while?
You mean, to forget?
Oh, no, Midge, don't be so motherly.
I'm not gonna crack up.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I'm having one right now.
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...
Oh.
What's this doohickey?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.
I've never run across one like that.
It's brand-new.
Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do.
Works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
- It does?
- Mmm-hmm.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it.
He worked it out in his spare time.
Kind of a hobby.
A do-it-yourself type of thing.
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Well...
Normal.
Aren't you ever gonna get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
You mean me.
We were engaged once, though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Good old college days.
But you were the one that called off the engagement, you remember?
I'm still available.
Available Ferguson.
Oh, Midge, do you remember a fellow in college by the name of Gavin Elster?
Gavin Elster?
Yes, funny name.
You think I would. No.
I got a call from Gavin today.
It's funny, he sort of dropped out of sight during the war.
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.
It's a Mission number.
Well, that's skid row, isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum, and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum.
I'll buy him a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.
But not tonight.
How about you and me going out for a beer?
Mmm-mmm. Sorry, old man. Work.
Well, then, I think I'll go home.
Midge, what'd you mean,
"There's no losing it"?
What?
The acrophobia.
I asked my doctor.
He said that only another emotional shock could do it and probably wouldn't.
You're not gonna go diving off another rooftop to find out?
- I think I can lick it.
- Well, how?
I have a theory.
I have a theory. I think if I can get used to heights, just a little bit at a time, just a little, like that, progressively, you see?
I'll show you what I mean.
Here. I'll show you what I mean.
- We'll start with this.
- That?
What do you want me to start with, the Golden Gate Bridge? Now, watch.
Watch this. Here we go.
There. There.
Now, I look up, I look down.
I look up.
- All right, there's nothing to it.
- You're kidding.
- Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.
Here.
That's a girl. I'll use that.
Put it right there.
All right, here's the first step.
There.
Okay, now step number two.
All right.
Step number two coming up.
There we are.
See? I look up, I look down,
I look up...
I'm going right out and buy myself a nice tall stepladder.
Take it easy now.
All right, now here we go.
No problem.
Why, this is a cinch.
Here, I look up, I look down.
I look up, I look down.
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.
How did you get in the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Very interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Well, you don't have to do it for a living.
No, but one assumes responsibilities.
My wife's family is all gone.
Someone has to look after her interests.
Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East, Baltimore.
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.
I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
You like it, huh?
Well, San Francisco's changed.
The things that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all these.
Yes. I should have liked to have lived here then.
Color, excitement, power.
Freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No. No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the paper.
And you've quit the force.
Is it a permanent physical disability?
No, no.
It just means that I can't climb stairs that are too steep or go to high places, like the bar at the Top of the Mark.
But, there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.
Would you like a drink now?
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a little early in the day for me.
Well, I guess that just about covers everything, doesn't it?
I never married.
I don't see much of the old college gang,
I'm a retired detective, and you're in the shipbuilding business.
What's on your mind, Gavin?
I asked you to come up here, Scottie, knowing that you'd quit detective work.
But I wondered whether you'd go back on the job as a special favor to me.
I want you to follow my wife.
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.
Well, then...
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
If I told you that I believe this has happened to my wife, what would you say?
Well, I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist, or psychologist, or neurologist, or psycho...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.
I'd have him check on you, too.
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.
Okay.
I... I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.
And you're still the hardheaded Scot, aren't you?
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?
No.
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.
She'll be talking to me about something.
Suddenly, the words fade into silence.
A cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank.
She's somewhere else, away from me, someone I don't know.
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.
Then, with a long sigh, she's back, looks at me brightly, doesn't even know she's been away.
Can't tell me where or when.
Well, how often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks.
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.
I followed her one day, watched her coming out of the apartment, someone I didn't know.
She even walked a different way.
Got into her car and drove out to Golden Gate Park, five miles.
Sat by the lake, staring across the water at the pillars that stand on the far shore.
You know, Portals of the Past.
Sat there a long time, without moving.
I had to leave, get back to the office.
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.
She said she'd driven out to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake, that's all.
Well?
The speedometer on her car showed that she'd driven 94 miles.
Where did she go?
I've gotta know, Scottie, where she goes and what she does before I get involved with doctors.
Well, have you talked to the doctors at all, about that?
Yes, but carefully.
I want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.
Scottie...
All right, I'll get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you.
They're dependable, good boys.
I want you.
Look, this isn't my line.
Scottie, I need a friend, someone I can trust.
I'm in a panic about this.
I'm supposed to be retired.
I don't want to get mixed up in this darn thing.
Look, we're going to an opening at the opera tonight.
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.
Ernie's.
Say, will you tell me something about the lady sitting in there?
Who's the woman in the painting she's looking at?
Oh, that's Carlotta.
You'll find it in the catalog.
Portrait of Carlotta.
- May I have this?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Yes?
Is there something I can do for you?
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Oh, yes.
Would you tell me who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort.
Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know.
And I do believe it's against the law.
Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I...
Oh, dear, has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face...
What's her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yeah, that's it.
Sweet name, isn't it?
Foreign, but sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here, ever?
No, she just comes to sit two or three times a week.
I don't ask questions, you know, as long as they're well-behaved.
But I must say...
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today.
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.
No, she hasn't been here at all.
Well, I would have seen her, you know.
I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.
And there. There, you see?
Her key is on the rack.
Well, would you please go up and look?
- To her room?
- That's right.
Yes, of course, if you ask.
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Detective?
Would you like to come and look?
Her car's gone.
What car?
Midge, who do you know that's an authority on San Francisco history?
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.
None of this,
"Hello, you look wonderful," stuff.
Just a good straight, "Who do you know that's an authority on San Francisco..."
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
Well, who do you?
You know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
No, no, I don't mean that kind of history.
I mean the small stuff, you know, people you never heard of.
Oh.
Well, you mean the gay old bohemian days of gay old San Francisco.
Juicy stories, like who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Yeah, that's right.
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?
Pop Leibel. He owns the Argosy Book Shop.
Why, what do you want to know?
I want to know who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not a detective anymore.
What's going on?
You know him well?
Who?
Pop Leibel.
Oh, sure.
Well, come on, let's go.
I want you to introduce me. Get your hat.
I don't need a hat.
Hey, Johnny, what's it all about?
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Hello. Yes, I remember. Carlotta.
The beautiful Carlotta.
The sad Carlotta.
What does an old wooden house at the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with Carlotta Valdes?
Well, it was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.
- By whom?
- By...
By...
No. The name, I do not remember.
A rich man, a powerful man.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.
It is not an unusual story.
She came from somewhere small to the south of the city.
Some say from a mission settlement.
Young, yes. Very young.
And she was found dancing and singing in a cabaret by that man.
And he took her and built for her the great house in the Western Addition.
And there was a...
There was a child.
Yes, that's it. A child. A child.
I cannot tell you exactly how much time passed, or how much happiness there was.
But, then, he threw her away.
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.
So he kept the child and threw her away.
You know, a man could do that in those days.
They had the power and the freedom.
And she became the sad Carlotta.
Alone in the great house, walking the streets alone.
Her clothes becoming old and patched and dirty.
And the mad Carlotta.
Stopping people in the streets to ask,
"Where is my child?
"Have you seen my child?"
Poor thing.
And she died.
- She died.
- How?
By her own hand.
There are many such stories.
- Well, thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I appreciate it. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Hey, wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?
For bringing you here.
Come on, tell.
There's nothing to tell.
You'll tell or you'll be back in that corset.
Come on, Johnny, please.
Come on, come on. I'll take you home.
There we are.
- You haven't told me everything.
- No, I've told you enough.
Who's the guy and who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one that phoned, your old college chum, Elster.
- Midge, out, please.
- And the idea is that the beautiful, mad Carlotta has come back from the dead and taken possession of Elster's wife.
Now, Johnny, really. Come on.
Well, I'm not telling you what I think.
I'm telling you what he thinks.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I...
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Yes.
I guess you'd consider that she would be...
I think I'll go take a look at that portrait. Good-bye.
Midge...
- Good-bye.
- Midge, you...
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.
- That's Carlotta Valdes.
- Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.
Oh, yeah.
You notice the way she does her hair?
You know, there's something else.
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.
She inherited them.
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.
Until now.
Now, when she's alone, she takes them out and looks at them, handles them gently, curiously.
Puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror.
And goes into that other world, is someone else again.
Now, Carlotta Valdes was what?
Your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother.
Now, the child who was taken from her, whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.
And the McKittrick Hotel is the old Valdes home.
Well, I think that explains it.
Anyone could become obsessed with the past with a background like that.
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
She knows nothing of a grave out at the Mission Dolores?
Or that old house on Eddy Street? The...
- The portrait at the Palace of the Legion of...
- Nothing.
Well, when she goes to these places...
She's no longer my wife.
Well, how do you know all these things she doesn't?
Her mother told me most of them before she died.
I dug out the rest for myself here.
Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
Natural fear.
Her grandmother went insane, took her own life.
Her blood is in Madeleine.
Boy, I need this.
Madeleine.
Madeleine!
Yes?
No, it's all right.
Yeah, I'll call you back.
Yes.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Oh. Oh, your...
You'll want this.
You'd better come over here by the fire where it's warm.
What am I doing here?
What happened?
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.
Come on over by the fire.
Here, I'll get you some cushions.
There you are.
Would you like to have some coffee?
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink.
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?
That's right.
Thank you.
You don't remember?
No, I...
You remember where you were?
Why, yes. Yes, of course I remember that.
But then I must have had a dizzy spell and fainted.
Where were you?
At old Fort Point, out at the Presidio.
Of course, I remember.
I often go there.
Why? Why do you go there?
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there, especially at sunset.
Thank you for the fire.
Where were you before?
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.
Wandering about.
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?
Downtown, shopping.
Here, you'd better have some coffee.
I think it's still warm.
You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. You're merely direct.
And what were you doing there, at old Fort Point?
Oh, just wandering about.
Oh, you like it too?
Yes.
And where had you been just before?
I'd been to the Palace of the
Legion of Honor, the art gallery.
Oh, yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?
I've never been inside, but it looks so lovely driving past.
It's lucky for me you were wandering about.
Thank you.
I've been a terrible bother to you.
No, you haven't.
Oh, when you...
There were some pins in my hair.
Oh, the pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get them for you.
And my purse, please.
Here you are.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Well, I didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car.
Oh, but then, you didn't know my car, did you?
No, I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.
But I didn't think you wanted to be taken home that way.
No, you're right.
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.
Thank you. But I don't know you, and you don't know me.
My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name's John Ferguson.
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?
Oh, John, mostly.
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh, gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.
Oh, no.
And after what happened this afternoon,
I should think maybe you'd call me Scottie.
Maybe even John.
I prefer John.
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
No, it's wrong.
I'm married, you know.
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
Falling into San Francisco Bay.
Oh.
No. No, it's never happened before.
Oh, I've fallen into lakes out of rowboats when I was a little girl.
I even fell into the river once, trying to leap from one stone to another.
But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay.
Have you ever before?
No, it's the first time for me, too.
Here, I'll get you some more coffee.
Hello?
Scottie, what happened?
She's not home yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.
Oh, what happened?
She went into the Bay.
Hello? Hello?
Did she hurt herself?
No, she's going to be in fine shape.
There's nothing to worry about.
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?
She doesn't know what happened.
Scottie, Madeleine is 26.
Carlotta Valdes committed suicide when she was 26.
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.
Well now, Johnny-O. 
Was it a ghost?
Was it fun?
That letter for me?
Yes. Hello.
Hello.
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine.
No aftereffects.
But as I remember now, the water was cold, wasn't it?
It sure was.
What a terrible thing for me to do.
You were so kind.
It's a formal thank-you note and a great big apology.
Oh, you've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes, I do.
The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you.
Not at all. I enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I'll get my mail.
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
No. No, thank you.
Well, I couldn't mail it.
I didn't know your address, but I had a landmark.
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.
Well, that's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again sometime.
We have.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Shopping?
No.
Well, anywhere in particular?
No, I just thought that I'd wander.
Oh, that's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, that's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?
Yeah, well, don't you think it's kind of a waste for the two of us...
- To wander separately?
- Uh-huh.
But only one is a wanderer.
Two together are always going somewhere.
No, I don't think that's necessarily true.
You left your door open.
Be right back.
How old?
Oh, some 2,000 years or more.
The oldest living things.
Yes.
You've never been here before?
No.
What are you thinking?
Of all the people who've been born and have died, while the trees went on living.
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living."
- I don't like them.
- Why?
Knowing I have to die.
Here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down.
Somewhere in here, I was born, and there I died.
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.
Madeleine.
Madeleine.
Madeleine, where are you now?
- Here with you.
- Where?
Tall trees...
Have you been here before?
- Yes.
- When?
When were you born?
- Long ago.
- Where?
When? Tell me.
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!
Madeleine, tell me what it is.
Where do you go?
- What takes you away?
- No, I can't tell you.
When you jumped into the bay, you didn't know where you were.
- You guessed, but you didn't know.
- I didn't jump.
- I didn't jump. I fell. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?
- Why did you jump?
- I can't tell you.
Why did you jump?
What was there inside
- that told you to jump?
- No, please. Please.
What? What?
Please don't ask me. Please don't ask me.
Take me away from here.
Shall I take you home?
Somewhere in the light.
Promise me something.
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.
Why did you run?
I'm responsible for you now.
You know, the Chinese say that once you've saved a person's life, you're responsible for it forever, so I'm committed.
I have to know.
There's so little that I know.
It's as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of that mirror still hang there.
And when I come to the end of the corridor, there's nothing but darkness.
And I know that when
I walk into the darkness, that I'll die.
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.
Except once.
Yesterday?
And you didn't know.
You didn't know what happened till you found yourself with me.
You didn't know where you were.
But the small scenes, the fragments of the mirror, you remember those.
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?
There's a room, and I sit there alone.
Always alone.
What else?
A grave.
Where?
I don't know.
It's an open grave and I...
I stand by the gravestone, looking down into it.
- It's my grave.
- But how do you know?
I know.
But is there a name on the gravestone?
No. No, it's new and clean and waiting.
Well, what else?
This part is a dream. I think.
There's a tower, and a bell and a garden below.
It seems to be in Spain, a village in Spain.
It clicks off and it's gone.
Well, a portrait?
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.
If I could just find the key, the beginning, and put it together, I...
So, explain it away?
There's a way to explain it, you see.
If I'm mad, then that would explain it, wouldn't it?
Madeleine!
Oh, Scottie!
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.
There's someone within me, and she says I must die.
Oh, Scottie, don't let me go.
I'm here. I've got you.
I'm so afraid.
Don't leave me.
Stay with me.
All the time.
Hi, Johnny.
Hi.
Did you get my message?
I did, indeed.
I'll get you a drink.
Okay.
Since when do you go around slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone.
For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee.
Where do you go these days?
Just wandering.
Where?
Round about.
Oh.
What was this...
What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in my note was,
"Where are you?"
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.
Yeah, I detected a little undercurrent.
Well, I just thought that if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful, you'd take me to a movie.
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, this and that.
What I've been doing?
Only if you want to.
I'm sure we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Naturally.
What have you been doing?
Wandering.
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.
Oh, I've been having a wonderful time.
I've gone back to my first love, painting.
Well, good for you.
I always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
You know, it's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.
What is it? A still life?
No. No, not exactly.
You wanna see?
Hmm. Yeah.
Matter of fact, I thought
I might give it to you.
Oh?
Johnny!
It's not funny, Midge.
- Johnny!
- No.
Johnny, I just thought...
Uh-uh.
No.
Let's make that movie some other night, okay?
Johnny!
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!
Idiot!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Madeleine! What's the matter?
What time is it?
I should have phoned you, but I wanted to see you and be with you.
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.
Now, now, it's gonna be all right.
It'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you some brandy.
Just drink this down.
Here, just like medicine.
There now.
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.
Now, can you tell me?
It was the tower again, and the bell, and the old Spanish village.
Yes?
Clear, so very clear for the first time.
All of it.
Tell me.
It was a village square and a green with trees, and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister.
Across the green, there was a big, gray, wooden house, with a porch and shutters and a balcony above, a small garden, and next to it a livery stable with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.
At the end of the green, there was a whitewashed stone house, with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.
And an old wooden hotel from the old California days?
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings, with hanging oil lamps?
Yes.
It's all there. It's no dream.
You've been there before.
You've seen it.
No, never.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco, there's an old Spanish mission,
San Juan Bautista it's called, and it's been preserved exactly as it was 100 years ago, as a museum.
Now, think hard, darling.
Think hard.
You've been there before.
You've seen it.
No, no, I've never...
I've never been there.
Oh, Scottie, what is it?
I've never been there.
Think hard.
Now go on about your dream.
What was it that frightened you so?
I stood alone on the green searching for something.
And then I started to walk to the church.
But then the darkness closed in and I was alone in the dark.
Being pulled into the darkness, and I fought to wake up.
Oh, you're going to be all right now, Madeleine.
Don't you see?
You've given me something to work on now.
I'm going to take you down there to that mission, this afternoon.
And when you see it, you'll remember when you saw it before, and it'll finish your dream. It'll destroy it.
I promise you. All right?
Come on now.
I'll take you home.
No. I'll be all right.
You come back here around noon.
Madeleine, where are you now?
- Here with you.
- And it's all real.
It's not merely as it was
100 years ago, or a year ago, or six months ago, or whenever it was you were here to see it.
Now, Madeleine, think of when you were here.
There were not so many carriages then.
There were horses in the stalls.
A bay, two black and a gray.
It was our favorite place.
But we were forbidden to play here.
Sister Teresa would scold us.
Look at this.
Well, here's your gray horse.
Have a little trouble getting in and out of the stall without being pushed, but even so...
You see? There's an answer for everything.
Madeleine, try.
Try for me.
I love you, Madeleine.
I love you, too.
Too late. Too late.
No, no, we're together.
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.
No. There's nothing you must do.
There's nothing you must do.
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.
No, it's too late.
Look. It's not fair.
It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.
It shouldn't have happened.
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's all that counts.
- Look, let me go. Please let me go!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
You believe I love you?
Yes.
And if you lose me, then you'll know I...
I loved you and I wanted to go on loving you.
I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church, alone.
But why?
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Ferguson.
Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was not well with his wife's mental state, took the preliminary precaution of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson, lest any harm befall her.
And you have heard that
Mr. Elster was prepared to take his wife to an institution, where her mental health would have been in the hands of qualified specialists.
Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective, would have seemed the proper choice for the role of watchdog and protector.
As you have learned, it was an unfortunate choice.
However, I think you'll agree that no blame can be attached to the husband.
His delay in putting his wife under medical care was due only to the need for information as to her behavior, which he expected to get from Mr. Ferguson.
He had taken every precaution to protect his wife.
He could not have anticipated that
Mr. Ferguson's weakness, his fear of heights, would make him powerless when he was most needed.
As to Mr. Ferguson, you have heard his former superior,
Detective Captain Hansen, from that great city to the north, testify as to his character and ability.
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.
The fact that once before, under similar circumstances,
Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague to fall to his death,
Captain Hansen dismissed as an "unfortunate incident."
Of course, Mr. Ferguson is to be congratulated on having once saved the woman's life, when, in a previous fit of aberration, she threw herself into the Bay.
It is a pity that knowing her suicidal tendencies, he did not make a greater effort the second time.
But we are not here to pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.
He did nothing.
And the law has little to say on the subject of things left undone.
Nor does his strange behavior after he saw the body fall have any bearing on your verdict.
He did not remain at the scene of the death. He left.
He claims he suffered a mental blackout and knew nothing more until he found himself back in his own apartment in San Francisco several hours later.
You may accept that, or not.
Or you may believe that having once again allowed someone to die, he could not face the tragic result of his own weakness and ran away.
That has nothing to do with your verdict.
It is a matter between him and his own conscience.
Now, from the evidence of the state of mind of Madeleine Elster prior to her death, from the manner of her death, and from the postmortem examination of the body showing the actual cause of her death, you should have no difficulty in reaching your verdict, gentlemen.
You may retire if you wish.
Hold on, Mr. Jones.
We've reached a verdict.
Thank you.
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster committed suicide
"while of unsound mind."
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.
All right, Scottie, let's go.
Mind if I speak to him for a minute?
No, go ahead.
Scottie.
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.
He had no right to speak to you like that.
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.
I can't stay here.
I'm going to wind up her affairs and mine, get away as far as I can.
Europe, perhaps.
And I probably never will come back.
Good-bye, Scottie.
If there's anything I can do for you before I go.
There was no way for them to understand.
You and I know who killed Madeleine.
Come on, Scottie.
Let's get out of here.
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.
I had a long talk with that lady in musical therapy, Johnny, and she says that Mozart's the boy for you, the broom that sweeps the cobwebs away.
Well, it's what the lady said.
You know, it's wonderful how they have it all taped now, John.
I have music for dipsomaniacs, and music for melancholiacs, and music for hypochondriacs.
I wonder what would happen if somebody got their files mixed up.
I brought a lot of other things, and you can see what you like.
It shuts off automatically.
Oh, Johnny. Johnny, please try.
Try, Johnny.
You're not lost. Mother is here.
Time?
Okay.
I'll be in again, John.
You want me to shut that off?
Oh, John-O.
You don't even know I'm here, do you?
But I'm here.
Nurse, could I see the doctor for a moment?
Doctor, Miss Wood.
Won't you go in, please?
Yes, Miss Wood?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Well, it's hard to say.
At least six months. Perhaps a year.
It really could depend on him.
He won't talk.
No. He's suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex.
He blames himself for what happened to the woman.
We... We know little of what went on before.
Well, I can give you one thing.
He was in love with her.
Oh, that does complicate the problem, doesn't it?
I can give you another complication, he still is.
And you want to know something, Doctor?
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.
Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?
- This... This car?
Why, I bought it from a man who used to live here, in this apartment building,
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.
Oh, you knew him and his wife.
The poor thing. I didn't know her.
Tell me, is it true that she really...
I'm... I'm sorry.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Give me a scotch and soda, will you.
Well, what is it?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson.
Is this some kind of Gallup poll?
Oh, no.
- There are just couple of things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?
No. I happened to see you when you came in, so I thought...
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.
Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room.
Now, you beat it.
Go on and beat it.
No, please, please.
I just want to talk to you.
Listen, I'm gonna yell in a minute.
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Honest. I promise.
Please. Just let me talk to you.
- What about?
- You.
Why?
Because you remind me of somebody.
I heard that one before, too.
I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but then she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since.
Then you saw me and something clicked.
Well, you're not far wrong.
Well, it's not gonna work, so you better go.
Please, let me come in.
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.
Well, I warn you,
I can yell awful loud.
Now, you won't have to.
Well, you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.
- Who you are?
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.
No, but, how do you happen to be living here?
It's a place to live, that's all.
No, but you haven't lived here long?
Yeah, about three years.
Well, where did you live before?
Salina, Kansas.
Listen, what is this?
What do you want?
I just want to know who you are.
Well, I told you.
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.
I work at Magnin's, and I live here.
My gosh, do I have to prove it?
All right, mister, my Kansas driver's license.
Judy Barton, number Z296794,
425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.
A California license issued May 25, 1954.
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?
And whether you're satisfied or not, you can just beat it.
Gee, you have got it bad, haven't you?
Do I really look like her?
She's... She's dead, isn't she?
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Yes, that's me with my mother.
And that's my father.
He's dead.
My mother married again, but I didn't like the guy, so I decided I'd see what it's like in sunny California.
I've been here three years.
Honest.
Will you have dinner with me?
Why?
Well, I just feel that I owe you something after all this.
You don't owe me anything.
Well, then will you? For me?
Dinner and what else?
Just dinner.
'Cause I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Well, I've been on blind dates before.
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.
Okay.
All right, I'll get my car.
I'll be back for you in half an hour.
Oh, no, you better give me time to change and get fixed up.
An hour?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.
Dearest Scottie.
And so you found me.
This is the moment that I dreaded and hoped for.
Wondering what I would say and do if I ever saw you again.
I wanted so to see you again, just once.
Now I'll go, and you can give up your search.
I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself for.
You were the victim.
I was the tool, and you were the victim of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.
He chose me to play the part because
I looked like her. He dressed me up like her.
It was quite safe because she lived in the country and rarely came to town.
He chose you to be the witness to a suicide.
The Carlotta story was part real, part invented,
to make you testify that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.
He knew of your illness.
He knew you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.
I made the mistake.
I fell in love.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I'm still in love with you, and I want you so to love me.
If I had the nerve,
I'd stay and lie,
hoping that I could make you love me again
as I am for myself.
And so forget the other and forget the past.
But I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.
Oh, here. Here, I'll do it.
There you are.
Thanks again. Good night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well...
No, I mean tomorrow morning.
But I have to go to work.
I've got a job.
Don't go to your job.
And what'll I live on?
My oil wells in Texas?
Let me take care of you, Judy.
Thanks very much, but no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right.
I've been understanding since I was 17.
- And the next step is?
- No, no. No, no.
No? Then what?
We could just see a lot of each other.
Why?
'Cause I remind you of her?
It's not very complimentary.
And nothing else?
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
I just want to be with you as much as I can, Judy.
Well, I guess I could phone the store in the morning and make some excuse.
There you are.
I like that one.
Like that?
- Yes.
- All right.
Well, that's very nice.
It's beautiful.
There we are.
Now, we'll get this, and then we'll buy you those clothes.
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.
It's the best. How much is that?
That'll be 50 cents. Thank you.
Scottie, you don't have to.
But I want to.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
But you said gray, sir.
Now, look. I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.
But I like that one, Scottie.
No, no. It's not right.
Gentleman seems to know what he wants.
All right. We'll find it.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But... But I love the second one she wore.
And this one, it's beautiful.
No, no. They're none of them right.
Oh, I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.
Let me go and see.
We may still have that model.
Thank you.
You're looking for the suit that she wore, for me.
You want me to be dressed like her.
Judy, I just want you to look nice.
I know the kind of suit that'd look well on you.
Oh, no. No, I won't do it!
Judy.
Judy, it can't make that much difference to you.
I just want to see...
No, I don't want any clothes. I don't want anything.
I want to get out of here.
Judy, do this for me.
Here we are.
Yes, that's it.
I thought so.
- I don't like it.
- No, we'll take it.
Will the thing fit?
Well, yes. It might need some slight alterations, but it's madam's size.
All right, dear.
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.
How long will the alterations take?
Well...
May we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary.
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look at a dinner dress, an evening dress.
Short, black, with long sleeves, and a kind of square neck.
Scottie!
My! You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.
All right. That's it.
Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.
- Fine.
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down, just like medicine.
Stop.
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?
I don't know.
I don't know. No good, I guess.
I don't know.
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.
You can, you know.
No. You wouldn't let me.
And I don't wanna go.
Oh, Judy. Judy, I tell you this.
These past few days have been the first happy days I've known in a year.
I know. I know because...
'Cause I remind you of her.
And not even that very much.
No. No, Judy. Judy, it's you, too.
There's something in you that...
You don't even want to touch me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Couldn't you like me, just me, the way I am?
When we first started out, it was so good. We had fun.
And... And then you started in on the clothes.
Well, I'll wear the darned clothes if you want me to, if you'll just like me.
The color of your hair.
Oh, no.
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.
If...
If I let you change me, will that do it?
If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Yes.
- Yes.
- All right.
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.
Here, come on. We'll sit by the fire.
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.
The young lady thought perhaps you'd like to go home.
And then she'll come there as soon as she's finished.
Well, no. You tell her I'll go to her hotel and wait for her there.
Oh, and you're sure about the color of the hair?
Oh, yes. It's an easy color.
- And all the rest of...
- Yes, sir, we know what you want.
Thank you.
Well?
It should be back from your face and pinned at the neck.
I told her that.
I told you that.
We tried it.
It just didn't seem to suit me.
Please, Judy.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Anywhere you like.
Ernie's?
You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?
Well, after all, it's our place.
Hello, my love. Like me?
Mmm-hmm.
Is that the best you can do?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Well, that's what I had in mind.
Now, come here.
It's too late. I got my face on.
And I'm suddenly hungry.
Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, no. Ernie's is fine.
I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna have one of those big, beautiful steaks.
Let me see.
To start, I think I'll...
Help me with this, will you?
I have it.
How do you work this thing?
Can't you see?
Oh. Now, there you are.
Thank you. I'm just about ready.
All I've got to do is find my lipstick.
Where did I put it?
I had it a minute ago.
I wonder if it's here.
Here it is.
There, I'm ready.
But first, muss me a little?
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?
How would you like to go someplace out of town for dinner?
Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
All right. If you'd like.
We're going awfully far.
I just feel like driving.
You terribly hungry?
No. No, it's all right.
Where're you going?
One final thing I have to do.
And then, I'll be free of the past.
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you.
I have to go back into the past once more.
Just once more, for the last time.
Why? Why here?
Madeleine died here, Judy.
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait here.
- No, I need you.
Why?
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.
And when it's done, we'll both be free.
- I'm scared.
- Oh, no. I have to tell you about Madeleine now.
Right there.
We stood there, and I kissed her for the last time.
And she said, "If you lose me,
- "you'll know that I loved you..."
- Scottie.
"and wanted to keep on loving you."
And I said, "I won't lose you."
But I did.
And then she turned and ran into the church.
And when I followed her, it was too late.
I don't wanna go in there!
It's too late.
Scottie, I...
I couldn't find her, and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.
She was running up the tower.
Right here.
- Scottie...
- See? She was running up the stairs, through the trapdoor at the top of the tower.
And I tried to follow her, but I couldn't get to the top.
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.
One doesn't often get a second chance.
I want to stop being haunted.
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.
Take me away!
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.
- No!
- Go up the stairs.
Go up the stairs, Judy.
And I'll follow.
This was as far as I could get, but you went on.
Remember?
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.
I remembered the necklace.
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
You can't! You're afraid!
Now, we'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.
Scottie, please!
But you knew that day that I wouldn't be able to follow you, didn't you?
Who was up there when you got up there?
Elster and his wife?
- Yes.
- Yes, and she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.
You were the copy.
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?
- Was she dead or alive when...
- Dead! Dead! He'd broken her neck.
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?
So, when you got up there, he pushed her off the tower, but it was you that screamed.
Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, Scottie.
I ran up to stop it. I...
If you wanted to stop it, why did you scream, since you tricked me so well up to then?
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.
Not only the clothes and the hair, but the looks, and the manner, and the words, and those beautiful phony trances.
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer, aren't you? Aren't you?
- Aren't you?
- Yes!
And then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?
Did he tell you exactly what to do, what to say?
You were a very apt pupil, too, weren't you?
You were a very apt pupil.
Why did you pick on me? Why me?
Your accident! Your accident.
My accident...
I was the setup, wasn't I?
I was the setup.
I was a made-to-order witness. I...
I made it.
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?
We're going up and look at the scene of the crime.
Come on, Judy.
And this is where it happened.
And the two of you hid back there and waited for it to clear, and then you sneaked down and drove into town, is that it?
And then? You were his girl?
Well, what happened to you?
What happened to you?
Did he ditch you?
Oh, Judy, with all of his wife's money, and all that freedom, and that power, and he ditched you.
What a shame.
But he knew he was safe. He knew you couldn't talk.
Did he give you anything?
Some money.
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.
And there was where you made your mistake, Judy.
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.
You shouldn't have been...
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I loved you so, Madeleine.
Scottie.
I was safe when you found me.
There was nothing that you could prove.
When I saw you again, I couldn't run away.
I loved you so.
I walked into danger and let you change me because I loved you, and I wanted you.
Oh, Scottie. Oh, Scottie, please.
You loved me. Now, keep me safe.
- Please!
- Too late.
It's too late.
There's no bringing her back.
Please.
- No!
- I heard voices.
God have mercy.

This is the road to town.
Those who leave our village,
and those who later return to their birthplace,
walk along this road.
She's not waiting for anyone.
The one she used to wait for, her son Alyosha,
did not return from the war.
He's buried far from his birthplace,
near a town with a foreign name.
Strangers bring flowers to his grave.
They call him a Russian soldier,
a hero, a liberator.
But to her he was simply a son,
about whom she knew everything
from the day he was born
to the day he left along this road for the front.
He was our friend.
We will tell his story, a story not everyone knows--
not even her--his mother.
BALLAD OF A SOLDIER
- That's it! Let's go!
- But what about reporting?
You want to report from the next world? Scram!
Eagle! Eagle! I see tanks!
Eagle! Eagle! Do you read me?
Eagle! This is Finch.
This is Finch! Eagle!
This is Finch! Answer me!
Yes, this is Finch!
I see tanks! Four of them!
They're heading straight towards me.
There's no infantry.
I can pull back.
You don't like that, eh?
- Skvortsov, report to the general.
- Skvortsov, report to the general.
Here he is, Comrade General.
Private Skvortsov, reporting as ordered.
Well, hero, come here.
Tell us everything that happened.
Were you at the observation point?
- Yes.
Well, what happened?
Comrade General, to be honest,
I was afraid!
They were so close...
I was scared.
You were so scared that you knocked out two tanks?
Out of fright?
Everybody hear?
I wish everybody were so scared.
Wait a minute. Is it possible that somebody else did it?
No, it was me.
Excellent.
I'm putting you up for a decoration.
Include Skvortsov on the list.
- Yes, Comrade General.
Please make note of this.
Comrade General, instead of my decoration, could I go home to see my mother?
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.
When I was leaving, I didn't have time to say good-bye to my mother.
And I just got a letter from her.
The roof is leaking.
Please let me go, Comrade General.
We'd all like to go home, Skvortsov, but we can't leave the front.
This is war and we're all soldiers.
I wouldn't have asked you if we weren't all taking a rest now.
I just need one day,
Comrade General.
I'll fix the roof and come right back.
Well, should we let Skvortsov go home?
Let him fix the roof?
Just make sure you're back on time!
Well, I... Comrade General...
I'll do whatever it takes!
Sit down.
You're pretty lucky, Skvortsov.
Where are you going?
To Georgievsk, the village of Sosnovka.
I could be there by tomorrow.
- No, my friend.
The way things are going nowadays, a day won't be enough.
I'll give you two days to get there and two to get back.
And two to fix the roof.
Satisfied?
Comrade General.
Can I go now?
- Go!
Just make sure you're back on time.
- Yes, Comrade General!
Fellows, give us a hand!
- Take care!
- Thanks, guys!
- Have a good trip!
- Thank you!
Hey, friend! Wait a minute!
Are you going on leave?
- Yes.
- To Georgievsk?
- Yes.
I'm from Uzlovaya.
We're neighbors!
Stop by at this address.
- I won't have enough time. I can't.
You have to change trains at Uzlovaya anyway.
Chekhov Street.
Not far from the station.
Stop by, friend!
- Okay. What should I say?
Say that you saw me!
Tell Liza that her Sergei is all right, that you saw him yourself.
Tell his Liza that he dreams about her day and night.
Sergei, you ought to give her some sort of present.
What can he give?
Everything he has is army-issue.
Quit talking!
Sergeant, give Sergei a cake of soap!
It's for his wife!
- His ration is only for one washing.
- Give him a whole cake.
I have only two cakes for the entire platoon.
- Well, give him one.
- That's against regulations.
- Come on, Comrade Sergeant!
- Don't be stingy!
It's for his wife.
Open it.
She's going to be happy.
- Soap is now a delicacy.
- A deficit, you moron.
She'll be happy regardless.
- Let him have the second one, too!
- He's right, Sergeant!
Come on, Sergeant.
- Comrade Sergeant...
- Here. Take it!
Close it.
- 7 Chekhov Street.
- I'll find it.
Let me help you.
Where are you going?
- To Gorisov.
Me, too.
That's where I'm changing trains.
Going home?
- Yes, I've finished fighting.
I'm going home, too.
On leave. I got lucky.
We'll be traveling to Gorisov together.
Thanks, friend.
- I'll help you in Gorisov, too.
- Someone will meet me there.
Your wife?
My wife.
Keep an eye on my suitcase.
I have to send a telegram.
What on earth are you doing?
The train's here.
It's about to leave.
- What's with you?
- What do you mean? We have to go!
I have your suitcase.
- So go by yourself.
- What's wrong?
- What do you want? Beat it!
Beat it? I have your suitcase.
Fine, I'm going.
- Wait a minute. Don't be angry, friend.
Things are hard for me.
I wrote to my wife and told her I wouldn't be coming.
- Why?
- I have to.
Even before the war, things weren't working out.
I was jealous of her.
And now--
Be quiet!
I don't want to, you understand?
She's young and pretty.
She'll find her happiness, right?
I don't know.
She will.
- What about you?
- What?
Where will you go now?
Russia is a big country.
That's despicable!
It's despicable to think that way!
She's waiting for you.
And what do you do?
You lie! It's despicable!
Wanna smoke?
Got a piece of paper for me?
- Here.
- Hey, friend, can you spare one?
Pass one over here.
How thin!
Kill the enemy. Read it and pass it on to your comrade.
And how's the tobacco supply on the front?
On the front? It's available.
It's available, hero!
That reminds me of the soldier who asked a collective farmer for a glass of water and said,
"Lady, give me something to drink.
I'm so hungry that I don't have a place to sleep."
Exactly!
The story of your life.
A good woman.
I can't forget her.
Then why forget about her?
After the war, go and marry her.
You fool!
She's already got a husband.
- Pockmarked like you?
- No, smooth.
Why would she trade a guy with smooth skin for someone pockmarked like you?
How should I know?
Maybe he has some other defect!
- Are you accompanying your friend?
- No, I'm by myself.
- Are you on a mission?
- No.
- Being transferred?
- No again.
- Then what?
- Home. On leave.
Who do you think you're kidding?
Come on!
I'm telling the truth.
I knocked out two tanks!
You see, even a signalman--
A signalman. Well, that's about average for a signalman, of course.
What did you knock them out with?
A telephone receiver.
It was double-barreled!
You know how it is with these signalmen?
They walk around, they see a tank.
First one, then another, and then into his bag.
I'm serious! When the general called me to the bunker--
- Soldier, enough already.
- Enough about you talking to the general!
Gimme this.
I'll prove it to you
What are you doing?
- Look!
- Looks like him!
Direct hit!
Why on earth did you ruin it?
I have a lot more just like it.
Don't think about it, son.
Everything will work out.
I can't.
I have a daughter who just got married and she's already a widow.
- You should go. Thanks.
- Yes, in a minute.
Let's go.
Vasya!
Oh, Vasya.
You're back. You're alive.
Well, here I am.
Now we're together.
I was in such a hurry.
The buses aren't running.
It's just a shaving.
I work at the factory now.
The steel coming out these days is very hard.
So, citizen, are you going to take this car or not?
Yes, coming.
Vasya, this is the driver.
Where are your things?
- There it is.
- I'll get it.
- Where's the boy?
- What boy?
The boy. The soldier.
He accompanied me.
A hero! He knocked out two tanks!
- Let's hurry. I'm running late.
How unfortunate. He left.
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.
- Are we taking off now? To Georgievsk?
- Yep.
- Listen, friend--
- He won't allow it.
Who won't allow it?
- The lieutenant.
- Do you understand what's going on?
I understand perfectly.
It's not allowed. It's strategic cargo.
- Hay is strategic cargo?
- Depends on who it's for.
- For horses. Who else?
- Depends on what kind of horses.
Fine, your hay is strategic!
But you've got to understand.
I've come from the front.
I'm on leave. I've already used up half a day and I only have two.
I understand perfectly, but the lieutenant won't.
- What kind of man is he?
- Him? A beast! Got it?
Listen, let's forget about the lieutenant.
I'll climb into the car and he won't know anything about it.
As if I feel like getting court-martialed for you.
Why court-martialed?
You set the wagon on fire, and I get court-martialed.
- Why on earth would I set it on fire?
- How would I know?
What do you have in that bag?
Maybe something flammable?
It's just canned beef. Look.
Canned beef?
So, you're trying to bribe a guard?
- What? Give me that!
- What's with you?
I was just kidding.
What, you can't take a joke?
Well, you convinced me.
Climb in.
Not a sound. Got it?
Got it.
Where are you going?
Let me go! Mama!
Let me go, you scoundrel!
Let me go!
What are you doing?
You're crazy!
You fool!
Leave me alone!
What have I ever done to you?
Don't come near me!
- Are you insane?
- If you come near me, you'll find out.
- Don't even think about it.
Get away from the door.
Get away, I tell you!
- I won't.
What's with you?
- What's with you?
- Why do you keep screaming?
- Don't come near me.
- Then get away from the door.
I won't.
I was right. You're insane.
Well, to hell with you.
Go ahead and jump!
Break your neck!
Why should I?
We're stopping soon.
Open the door. I'm getting off.
Keep away from the military transport.
Anyone caught will be court-martialed.
Hey, citizen, I'm talking to you!
Anyone caught will be shot!
- There's no point in that.
- It's all your fault.
I threw my things out because of you.
You would have killed yourself.
It's none of your business.
Quit pestering me.
Pestering you?
You jumped into the car yourself, and I'm pestering you?
Then why were you hiding in the straw?
- You think I was hiding from you?
- Who else?
From the lieutenant!
What lieutenant?
The one in charge of the transport.
He's a beast.
I snuck on the train, too.
If they catch me, they'll make me get off.
I'll have to wait for a passenger train, or even fly.
I'm scared of bigger things than you.
I thought you were the lieutenant.
I had a terrible fright and got slapped in the face, and it's all my fault.
I had everything in my bag: my things, some bread, a skirt.
Everything.
It's nothing.
When you go back, you can find your bag.
- You think so?
- Of course. Where could it go?
It's probably waiting for you on a bridge somewhere right now.
This train just keeps going and going.
We're pulling in.
When you get off, go quickly so nobody sees you.
What if I can't find my bag?
You know what?
Don't get out.
I have some food and the car is comfortable.
No, I'd better get out.
Any chance you'll stay?
No.
Someone's out there.
Yes.
Want a bite to eat?
Eat?
No, thanks. I'm full.
If you want any, you're welcome to it.
Don't be shy.
Look at this salo.
- Salo?
- Yes. Try some.
Well, maybe just a little piece.
Like it?
Dry rations.
I love the wafers too.
Remember, before the war?
- I lived in a village before the war.
- I lived in a city.
- Are you mad at me?
- For what?
Because I hit you.
It happens.
It made us friends.
- Stepanov, do you have the tarpaulin?
- No, Gavrilkin has it.
Call Gavrilkin.
Gavrilkin, do you have the tarpaulin?
Please forgive me.
I was so foolish.
Me, too. I frightened you.
You know what?
Let's introduce ourselves.
Let's.
My name is Alexei.
And mine is Shura.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Where are you going?
- Home, on leave. You?
Hurry up, Gavrilkin!
I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.
Something's jammed.
Hide! Hurry!
Here it is, Comrade Lieutenant.
- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.
He didn't notice us.
Were you scared, Shura?
- No.
- You're a scaredy-cat.
- No.
Shura, who are you going to see?
I'm on my way to Kupinsk.
To see my fiancé.
He's a pilot.
He's in the hospital.
He's very badly wounded.
Honest!
I'm getting off now.
Why?
Did I offend you?
Then why?
- Just because.
- You think I won't take you to your fiancé?
- I don't think anything.
I'm going out for water.
- Heard any news?
- Those rotting swine!
The battle for Novorossiisk is getting fierce.
We'll turn you over to the war tribunal for sneaking on board.
Follow me.
Follow me, I tell you.
- I won't.
Hey, stop that.
Ah, here's her lovey-dove now.
What's going on here?
We had an agreement, and you're sneaking civilians aboard?
What difference does it make if it's two people instead of one?
A big difference.
Come on, citizen.
She's not going anywhere, got it?
Get out of here.
What?
Who are you to give orders?
You've got it made: hay, a girl--
What? Shut up.
You think I didn't see?
I saw everything.
- What did you see?
- The two of you, tumbling in the hay.
Fine.
Attacking a guard while on duty.
You know what will happen?
- You miserable shit!
- From your point of view.
A miserable shit from your point of view.
From mine, I'm priceless.
Get the hell off this train, both of you.
If you don't,
I have every right to shoot.
So, shoot. We're not scared.
You still haven't seen the lieutenant.
That's why you're so brave.
Enough. We're both a little hot under the collar.
Let's talk it out.
- I have nothing to say to you.
Get out of here, and take your--
I'll give two warning shots and then--
You've really made yourself at home here.
What if I give you another can of meat?
How about two?
It will take much more than that to make up for the insult.
You want me to apologize to you?
Fine. Give me the canned meat.
What's going on here?
Comrade Lieutenant, they snuck into the car.
I'm taking appropriate measures.
Who are they?
Private Skvortsov. On leave.
Where are you headed?
To Georgievsk, Comrade Lieutenant.
Here are my papers.
I have only two days, and I'm already late.
You're a hero.
And the girl? Is she with you?
- Yes.
- No.
She lost all of her things... money, bread... so I had to...
- All right, all right.
- No, really! We--
- Just be careful with fire.
- Okay.
What's that?
Well, Comrade Lieutenant, it's sort of canned meat.
Who did you take it from? From them?
Give it back immediately.
But they gave it to me voluntarily.
Voluntarily?
Two days under arrest!
- For what?
- Five days?
- But I--
- Repeat the order!
- Five days...
- How disgraceful.
I told you: He's a beast.
Now we don't have to be afraid of any beast.
Beast!
Alyosha, it's so pleasant when you think badly of someone, only to discover that he's good.
Yes, that lieutenant is a good man.
Very.
Do you believe in friendship?
Of course I do. On the front, you'd be lost without it.
No, I know that.
I mean between a boy and a girl.
Some girls are even better than boys.
I think so, too.
But there are some who believe that they can only be in love.
Nonsense.
I used to be friends with a girl.
We were friends and didn't think at all about love.
- Maybe you were in love and didn't notice.
- With her? No.
- Maybe she was in love with you.
- She was just a little girl.
Our neighbor Zoika.
No, love is something different.
Alyosha, would you like to have a friend?
A true friend, to have your whole life?
Me, too! Why do you think I'm traveling?
Do you think--
You're doing the right thing, going to him. You're a good girl.
- That's not the only reason.
- You're a good girl.
You're not some sort of floozy.
No, Alyosha, you don't know anything.
You know what, Alyosha?
- What?
I'm so thirsty. Aren't you?
Yes.
- A quick stop?
- A quick stop.
The evening news, July 27th.
Throughout the day,
our troops have been fighting in the Voronezh region,
and also in the Tsimlyanskaya region.
After persistent battles,
our troops left the towns
of Hovocherkask and Rostov.
In other parts of the front,
there are no significant changes.
Over the past week, from the 19th to the 25th of July,
during aerial battles, on airfields...
Stop! Stop!
Can you take me to Uzlovaya?
I missed my train.
- Have you heard the news?
- Yes.
Damn it!
I haven't slept for two days.
What can you do!
Here, crank it.
What a truck.
We're the same age.
My son's on the front.
Field Post Office 139.
Have you heard of it?
No.
Don't fret, little fellow.
We'll get there in time.
- Stay back, soldier!
- This is my train!
You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
- To Georgievsk.
- That train left an hour and a half ago.
Alyosha!
Shura!
- Shura, you're still here.
- Yes.
Here, you forgot this.
- Shura, you're brilliant!
- It was my fault you didn't get back. - Silly girl! I thought I'd never see you again.
Well, I waited.
I'm so thirsty.
- You still haven't had anything to drink?
- No, I was afraid I'd miss you.
My little Shura.
Well, let's go.
- Soon you'll be home.
- You, too.
Don't worry, Shura.
He'll get better.
Alyosha, I've never met a fellow quite like you before.
Alyosha, who is that handkerchief for?
It's a gift for my mother.
- Really? The soap, too?
- What soap?
The soap in your bag.
- Let's go.
- Where?
- I have to give it to someone.
- The soap?
Yes, I promised.
Good thing you reminded me.
It's not far--Chekhov Street.
Is this Pavlov a friend of yours?
No, I don't know him at all.
We met by chance.
He was on his way to the front.
Chekhov Street.
- So close.
Grandma, where's building 7?
Right here.
Who are you looking for?
- The Pavlovs.
They're alive!
Are you looking for Lizaveta Petrovna or the old man?
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- She now lives on Semyonovskaya Street.
And the old man is at the institute, where the people who were bombed out live.
- Which is closer?
- Semyonovskaya Street.
Mitya will take you there.
- Grandma, look what I found!
- Good.
Mitya, take these people to see
Lizaveta Petrovna.
Mitya, this man is from the front.
- He's going to miss his train. Come on.
Let's go.
- Don't touch my bubbles!
- Kid, do the Pavlovs live here?
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- Over there.
You have to knock.
The bell doesn't work.
We're looking for Lizaveta Petrovna.
Please come in. That's me.
You must be--
I'm from the front.
I brought you a package.
Pavlov must have sent you.
Yes.
Please come in.
Excuse me for just a minute.
I'll be right back.
Someone's here from the front with a package from Pavlov.
What should I do?
- Tell the truth.
I can't.
What's the problem?
At least he'll know the truth.
- I beg you!
- Well, fine.
Please excuse me.
It's just so unexpected.
So, you're from the front?
From the front.
Your husband sent me.
He asked me to give you this.
- What is it?
- Soap.
Oh, soap.
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like some tea?
- No, we have to go.
- Why?
- I don't have enough time.
Tell me.
How is he?
- Pavlov?
He's fine.
He's worried about you.
Thank you.
Don't tell him about what you've seen here.
Although maybe... the truth is better.
Don't look at me like that.
You're still young.
Who are you here to see?
- We're looking for Pavlov.
- Vasilii Yegorovich!
It's for me.
Sergei sent him!
How is he?
- Don't worry, everything's fine.
Your son sent me.
Here, he sent you a little package.
- Soap!
- He's alive?
Of course he's alive!
Alive.
This means he's alive.
Thank you.
So this is a present from him.
Grandpa, lie down.
You're not supposed to--
- Is he wounded?
- Not at all. He's perfectly healthy.
What's the matter with me?
Please sit down.
Someone get them a little stool.
Here, sit down.
Tell me about him.
How's he doing there?
Well, he's a good fighter.
You could even say excellent.
Everyone respects him for his courage.
He's a brave man.
The commander always says we should follow Pavlov's example.
He's a steadfast soldier and a true friend.
Everyone in the regiment loves him.
Yes, yes.
Even as a boy, everyone loved my Sergei.
Well, we have to go.
Would you like some tea?
Thanks very much.
We don't have the time.
We have to go.
- Please excuse us, but he really has to go.
I understand. It's war.
Tell Sergei that I'm proud of him.
Everything's fine.
But don't tell him about this.
It's all temporary.
Better he not worry.
And tell him... that Liza, his wife, is working.
She sends her regards and is waiting for him.
I'll tell him.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Where are you going?
This is a war car.
- She's with me.
- Your wife?
- Yes.
- No.
Work it out first, then drag her on.
Citizen, you're not allowed.
It's a war car.
Was it really so hard for you to say yes?
Alyosha, my dear, go on without me.
You've already lost half a day because of me.
I'll be fine by myself.
It's not far from here.
Go, Alyosha, go.
- Put this on.
- Why?
Put it on, I said!
Hold it.
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!
- What's wrong?
- Someone stepped on my coat.
Well, this is it, Alyosha.
Yes. Don't forget me, Shura.
Alyosha, don't be angry with me, but I've deceived you.
How?
I don't have a fiancé.
I don't have anyone.
I'm going to my aunt's.
Please don't be angry.
I'm so silly, aren't I?
What did you do that for?
I was scared of you.
Are you scared now?
The train! Hurry, Alyosha, hurry!
Shura, wait! My address!
Write to me!
To the village of Sosnovka.
The village of Sosnovka! Shura!
I can't hear you!
When I told you
I didn't have anyone else,
I was admitting that I love you.
Why didn't you say anything?
You don't love me.
Wait, Shura.
I have something to tell you.
Let me through.
Let me off this train.
Are you traveling far, comrade?
To Sosnovka, just over the bridge.
It's about another 10 kilometers.
We're from the Ukraine.
We fly like birds in autumn, not knowing where we're going.
Empty words.
We're going to the Urals.
Our factory is there. Our sons are there.
Is that thunder?
- Going home?
- Yes.
For long?
There was more time, but now it's just for a night. My leave ends at dawn.
How awful.
A whole night at home-- you're very lucky!
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes.
Only she's not in Sosnovka.
I lost her.
Save the children! The children!
Step aside, soldier.
- Get out of the way.
- Good-for-nothing.
Comrades, I already told you:
We're only taking wounded women and children.
Everyone else will have to stay behind and wait.
A train will be here in exactly two hours.
Yes, Grandma, in two hours.
Two hours!
Have you lost your head?
Are you tired of living?
Friend! Take me to Sosnovka!
- I can't.
- It's only 10 kilometers.
I told you, I can't.
I've come from the front to see my mother.
I'll hug her and go right back.
And I should go to the slammer because of you? Get off!
To hell with you! You pig!
Girls, that was Katerina's boy,
Alyosha!
- Katerina's in the fields.
- Go get her--quickly!
You're back, Alexei Nikolaevich.
Zoika.
I didn't recognize you.
Do you know where my mother is?
- In the fields.
Have a seat and rest.
Have a bit of tea until Aunt Katya gets here.
I can't. I have to go now.
A car is waiting for me.
- Now?
- Now. Right this minute.
But what about Aunt Katya?
- She's not here. Let's go to the fields.
- They'll send me to jail!
- It's on the way.
- It's right nearby.
They're gonna get me for this anyway. Let's go!
Alyosha!
You've come back, my son.
You've made your mother happy.
I've been waiting, thinking about everything--
- How are you, Mama?
- Like everyone else.
I'm going through the war.
Work is hard.
There are no men--all women.
My dear, you've come back.
Alyosha, have you seen Ivan?
- When is the war going to end?
- Leave him alone. He just got back.
Let's go, Alyosha.
You can have a bite to eat and rest.
- Wait, Mama. I'm in a rush.
- Where are you rushing to?
I have to travel on.
I'm just stopping by for a minute.
What do you mean, son?
- I don't understand.
- I have to go. Right now.
Let's just talk for a moment.
I wanted to fix the roof.
You've grown. You're so thin.
It's just from the trip.
You're not sick, are you, Mama?
I don't have time to be sick.
Are you shaving already?
Do you smoke?
I have to go.
I won't let you!
- Forgive me, Mama.
- For what, Alyosha?
Forgive me, Mama.
What's wrong, Alyosha?
I'll survive. I'll get by.
I'll wait for you to come home.
I didn't wait for your father, but I'll wait for you.
Alyosha! Have you seen Ivan on the front?
When is the war going to end?
I'll be back, Mama!
That's all we have to tell you about our friend Alyosha Skvortsov.
He could have become a remarkable man.
He could have become a builder or beautified the land with gardens.
He was, and in our memory will forever remain, a soldier...
a Russian soldier.
Stay away from me!
You stink of dead bodies.
Give it up.
 We both smell of corpses.
And it's all your fault!
Your smell makes me want to puke.
Though shitworms can't smell shit.
What?
You're a shitworm.
 You make me sick.
And you thought we'd make
 a fortune at the war.
What's funny, you idiot!
It's all funny!
First, we arrived late to the war.
Then they mistook us for
the defeated side and forced us to bury the dead.
We finally escaped and now it's
 been 2 days we've only had water.
But the funniest thing is
 your foolish cry baby face.
Let's go home.
Don't you have any pride?
We've even been stripped
 of the arms we sold our homes for.
We can't go home like this.
Then take it off this dead guy.
Even if I'm desperate,
 I'm not a thief.
Do what you want. I'm going!
Go. I'll come home after
 I make a buck.
Don't come crying to me then.
Get caught again
 and be a gravedigger.
Fool! Go away!
It'll be a blessing to see you go,
 you shitworm.
We can't cross the border
 from this road.
It's a Yamana check station.
Not even a mouse could pass
 through those barricades.
If they find us, we're dead.
What now?
Unless a fog breaks out,
 we can't move.
What does it say up there?
It's a notice about a reward
 for 10 pieces of gold.
Read it to me.
"Wanted. Princess Yuki of Akizuki."
"A reward of ten ryo
 for her capture."
"Three ryo for information
 of her whereabouts."
"By order of the Lord of Yamana."
- Move!
 - Walk!
I'm not one of them.
I'm thankful for the fog
 but I can't see anything.
Which way is Hayakawa?
Shut up and follow me!
Who is it?
Not grave digging again.
Matashichi!
Listen!
There is 200 kan of pure gold
 hidden in this castle.
Until you find it, you're no
 longer men but moles!
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!
Matashichi, this is hell.
It's the end!
If we're going to die,
 let's die together.
That way!
Thieves! Rice thieves!
What shall we do now?
Find the Princess.
The Princess?
The sole survivor
 of the Akizuki clan.
I think the reward on her head
 is ten ryo.
Ten pieces of gold?
Informers get three.
Three pieces of gold?
It's no good. That's only a dream.
If we get greedy and get caught,
 we're done for.
I guess we'd better go home.
But how will we cross the border?
Bang and we're dead.
Let's eat.
I can't think on an empty stomach.
Not ready.
These don't burn at all.
What's this?
Why, it's gold!
You're right! It's gold!
But... a piece of gold...
 inside a stick?
I've heard of a rich man hiding
 gold in the pillars of his home, but...
What's this? An insignia!
Looks like a crescent.
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!
That's the reserve gold they were
 digging for in the castle.
You made the fire -
 where did you get the wood?
Let's split up and look.
I'll go this way.
 You go over there to the marsh.
The same piece!
What are you doing?
One's mine!
I found both!
I found the stick first.
I threw it!
I picked up the gold!
Liar! I'm the one who
 noticed it was gold.
- Let's go back.
 - Back?
There must be more.
If someone else notices it,
 we're screwed.
He's following us.
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.
You can't be sure.
 He may work for one.
He stopped following us.
Let's go back.
No, better be careful.
It's late, anyway.
 It won't hurt to wait one night.
It's a big job.
 Better safe than sorry.
We haven't seen that guy since,
 so maybe we didn't need to worry.
Probably a lumberjack
 or a charcoal maker.
So, let's get this straight now.
What?
Don't play dumb.
 How to split up the gold.
Let's be fair and divide it equally.
You don't like it?
- But I...
 - Then it's settled! All right?
Let's sleep.
Sleep tight, and let's dream
 of mountains of gold.
Hey!
Good eve...
Hey!
Cold, isn't it?
What are you doing here
 in the mountain?
How about you?
- Us? We intend to cross the border.
 - The border?
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
 - Hayakawa?
But beyond the mountains
 it's Yamana.
Yes... but you see... to go to Hayakawa...
This is Hayakawa.
And this is Akizuki where we are now.
This is... Yamana.
We want to go from Akizuki
 to Hayakawa.
But the border is guarded
 by Yamana soldiers.
So, we'll cross first to Yamana.
And then slip into Hayakawa.
See...
There's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan would go to Yamana,
 the enemy territory.
So the border between Akizuki
 and Yamana should be open.
That's right.
The Hayakawa-Yamana border
must be easier to cross than
 the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.
Anyway, we're just peasants.
Even if anything happened,
 we'd still make it.
All right. I've made up my mind.
Going through Yamana
 is a good idea.
The 200 gold pieces are useless
here, but with three men and three horses,
 we can carry it out.
200 gold pieces?
 What are you talking about?
Be honest.
I've got an eye on that place.
- Don't kick the stones.
 - You stop grabbing my leg.
What now?
What is he doing?
He's not here.
Where did he go?
That guy can't be trusted.
What is this place?
It's what they call
 a hidden fortress.
A hidden fortress?
 The Akizuki one.
Look. You can see all of Yamana.
But...
For a fortress,
 it's strangely empty.
Someone's here!
What are you doing?
Oh, it's that guy.
Hey. Come down quickly.
How did you get down there?
What are your names?
I'm Matashichi.
I'm Tahei.
Matashichi, put the rice down.
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.
Hurry up!
Where's the water? I need
 a drink before the food.
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.
Hey. What's your name?
Me? I'm Rokurota Makabe.
Rokurota Makabe?
 I've heard that name before.
Makabe...
Rokurota Makabe...
Get out of here. Rokurota Makabe is a legendary Akizuki
 samurai general.
You take us for fools.
We shouldn't put up with this.
Hey. Stop fooling around. You're no
 general, you're just a bully.
What's with the big attitude?
Don't make fun of us. Damn you.
What?
That wasn't very nice.
You could have told us if
 there was a secret passageway.
We've been partners
 since last night.
Besides, just because you found
this place first, doesn't mean you're the boss.
Let's decide now how
 we're going to divvy up.
Fair and square, we share it
 in three equal parts. Deal?
Here's the water.
Excellent.
This is some fortress that
 they have water like this.
Don't bother.
 I already went through there.
Just prepare the rice.
Shut up. I can't take it anymore.
 You can stuff your orders.
You want to fight?
Don't hold back. Do him in.
Cook the rice.
It's a girl.
Where is she? Who is she?
I don't know. She's really quick
 though. She's already gone.
Look. She's mine, OK? I'll kill you
 if you go near her.
Cook and then it's work.
What are you doing?
Don't touch me, fool!
 It's uncomfortable enough.
It's your face that
 makes me uncomfortable.
Leave my face alone.
I hate the way you blink
 all the time.
There you go again.
Shut up. Put your filthy teeth away.
Show them to me once more
 and I'll bash them in.
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
 I dig and dig and nothing!
It's his fault.
Dammit. Gone again.
He's on his high horse
 watching us do all the work.
Right. He's probably running
 around looking for that girl.
Maybe he already found a place
 and is sleeping with her.
We agreed to split everything in
 three. The girl should be the same.
That bully is not just anyone.
I can't figure out what he's up to.
He may already have found the 200
 pieces of gold and moved them.
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.
That means he's hiding the gold
 right now.
So if he's not in this fortress...
Look!
That spring is fishy.
Pretending like he's already
 checked it out... damn.
Where do you live?
Hey, lady, don't be mad.
What are you doing?
Shut up! I told you I'd kill you
 if you touched her!
Wait, boss. It's not fair.
Look. The girl dropped this.
Don't go behind our back.
 She's worth 10 ryo.
This does not belong
 to a country girl.
Maybe you think she's the
 Akizuki princess.
You're right.
That comb does belong
 to Princess Yuki.
But now it belongs to me.
 Give it back.
I took it from the Princess
 and gave it to her.
What?
I don't lie.
Then where is Princess Yuki?
I captured her and handed her
 over to the Yamana authorities.
Careful. I think he's full of crap.
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
 Still think it's a lie?
Tell me. Where did Matashichi go?
I don't know.
What are you plotting? Tell me!
To... to the town.
To do what?
He went to report.
Report who?
- The princess, of course.
 - The princess?
We're not as stupid as you think.
You thought you had fooled us
 but we're not that gullible.
I know your game.
Your reward money is just
 a part of the hidden gold.
You're greedy on top of it.
You want to capture
the princess yourself so you can have all the reward.
It won't go so smoothly.
I made a mistake
 by relying on scum.
You think you're better, scum?
Matashichi, did you see
 the officers?
Fool. Do you think
 I'd be back so soon?
It's the talk of town already.
The princess was captured a while back and
 she was beheaded yesterday.
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.
It's Rokurota Makabe.
Enter.
Any news?
Kofuyu served her duty.
The enemy will relax
 their guard now.
Now is our chance to escape.
What happened to Kofuyu?
As a dutiful servant, my sister went
 in place of your Highness.
This assures the safety
 of your Highness.
Rokurota!
Fool!
What are you saying your Highness?
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16. What
 difference is there in our souls?
It is our duty as servants.
 Kofuyu was honored...
Lies! If I were Kofuyu,
 I would curse this Princess.
Your words are too harsh.
 Rokurota has no leg to stand on.
Be quiet!
I don't even want to see your face!
Your nobility that doesn't
even shed a tear when you've killed your sister.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I don't know what to do with her
 Highness. It's the Lord's fault.
Even if he was lacking an heir, it was cruel to raise her Highness
 like a boy.
Say right and she'll go left,
 say left and she'll go right.
And though she is a girl,
 she has never shown me a tear.
The same
 with her present behavior.
Insensitive to your pain of having
 sacrificed your sister, she...
She herself does not shed a tear,
 but she still criticizes you.
It's too much.
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.
Her suffering of having to rebuild
 the Akizuki clan...
The Yamana's are here!
There are horses at the spring.
This is good, to fool the Yamana's
 by going through enemy lines.
This was the peasants' idea.
Depending on their answers,
 I was ready to kill them.
But hearing their plan to go
 through Yamana to Hayakawa,
I was stunned.
Sometimes even moss can be smart...
How long can we rely on them?
We can rely on their greed.
Make them carry gold and
 they'll put up with anything.
That takes care of the gold.
But we cannot take a chance
 with the Princess.
But staying here is not safe either.
This hidden fortress will soon
 be discovered by the Yamana's too.
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
 may not last either.
Understood.
But what shall we do
 with the Princess?
We can disguise her looks,
 but not her class.
And her speech...
Her Highness
 will have to be a mute.
A mute... isn't there any other way?
There isn't.
I don't know if the Princess
 would agree.
Leave it to me.
I hadn't ridden in a long time.
She runs fast. She's too good
 to be a packhorse.
Just in case you need to ride.
So we finally pass
 through enemy lines.
- Speaking of which, could you play mute?
 - Mute?
I'm sure you couldn't do it.
To go through Yamana, my greatest
 concern is your speech.
We were discussing
 you could be a mute...
But I think it's impossible.
I was captured once and
 had to pretend to be a mute.
It was agony.
Your Highness couldn't take it.
I'm not biting.
When you say right, I say left.
I'm a handful.
Let me use reverse psychology.
Princess.
All right.
This once I will let you fool me.
 Otherwise your plan will be foiled.
Your noble face again.
If you need anything, tell me now.
Once I'm a mute,
 I'm not talking until Hayakawa.
We have to tell him.
The bully? Never mind him.
Idiot, shut up. We'll get caught.
Where are you going?
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers
 have found us.
There were horses by the spring.
Idiots. I stole those.
We can't carry 200 pieces
 of gold without them.
Gold?
We'll climb down today.
Where is the gold?
Hey. Where is the gold?
Don't hold out on us. Come on.
I knew it!
Don't fool around with us.
You said you had already gone
 through there.
Why did you make us dig
 at the fortress?
I was testing you.
We'll need a lot of backbone
 on the road. You did well.
Lift the gold out of the water
 and onto the horses.
The three of us will carry the rest.
Gold!
Leave the gold in the wood.
Dammit.
Where did you hide this?
You're so suspicious.
 That's just firewood.
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
 She'll slow us down.
What if she blabs...
- She's mute. Don't worry.
 - Mute?
This will be an easy border
 to cross.
Wait.
Better be cautious.
Don't move 'til I come back.
If we want to get rid of him,
 now's our chance.
Don't worry. She's mute.
She's mute but she can hear.
Stupid. A mute can't speak
 because she's deaf.
This is where we have to think.
He's sly so we can't trust him even
 if we cross into Hayakawa.
He'll cheat us.
Let's run away.
What about his load?
We can't carry it.
 We'll take his horse.
There's no time to argue.
Let's tell her we're taking
 the horses for a drink.
Fool. They're not drinking sake.
What are you doing?
Where are the horses?
What shall we do?
Princess!
It's frustrating to be a mute.
 All I can do is watch.
The two of them?
Out of greed, they took the horses.
Then the enemy spotted them.
 Fine allies.
You!
We can't cross that river.
There is a firing squad
 on the other side.
I know your game.
 Take the gold and get lost.
He's gone.
Boss!
There he is.
Boss, the other side is lined
 with Yamana soldiers.
What would you do?
What do I care?
What are you doing?
Wait and see at the fortress?
Shut up. Go away.
Please, take us with you.
We promise to behave.
What's that?
The Yamana's found it!
What will we do?
We're leaving.
Which way?
Straight ahead.
You're joking!
Leave it to me. I have a plan.
Your pass?
Wait!
Boss.
Next!
Your pass. What's your problem?
I picked up something.
What? It's just a piece of wood.
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.
He found this.
The Akizuki crest!
You really found it
 at Mt. Suribachi?
Bring me my horse!
That gold is mine. Give it back.
No.
Give me the gold or a reward.
Shut up. Get lost.
Give me a reward. I won't move!
A reward! Give me a reward!
Greedy.
Two or three loaded horses,
 several men and a girl.
If you see such a group,
 arrest them immediately.
There are signs that Princess
 Yuki's party has been here.
But she was beheaded...
Using a double has been
 done before.
You also saw the smoke rise
 on the mountain across.
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.
It was guarded by an old soldier
 and two others.
They could have escaped. Instead
they burned the fortress and fought 'til their end.
It appears they wanted to signal
 and gain time for others to escape.
The Princess and a few men
 escaped with the gold for sure.
There are traces on the road.
Don't slack. Catch them
 and you will be rewarded.
Are you ok, boss?
Let's take a back road.
- Stop sneaking around. It invites suspicion.
 - But...
What are you doing?
We're staying here tonight.
Here?
You've got to be kidding me.
 Let's hurry through the night.
It's a long way. Let's not push it.
Then let's camp out.
Hide a stone among stones
 and a man among men.
Where will we hide the gold?
Leave it out in the open.
You're so slow. Get a clue
 and bring some water.
Always crying,
 but you refuse to take johns.
You were a lousy deal.
Where did you get her?
In Akizuki. Lose a war
 and plenty of women go on sale.
How much?
Five silver pieces. Want her?
Idiot. I'm not a dog like you.
- You bluff.
 - No, sorry.
Now, look here.
Look.
Average looking, but excellent
 body. How about it?
For one silver piece,
 she's yours for the night.
What's the use of buying a woman
 who won't take customers?
How much is she?
She's a looker!
She's not one of yours?
I'll buy her.
 Who does she belong to?
Whose girl is she?
I'll buy her! I'll buy her
 for a piece of gold!
Enough!
- She's a mute.
 - Mute?
That's too bad. I'll pass.
Who's the owner
 of the horse outside?
Is it yours?
Do you want to sell her to me?
I'll give you whatever you want.
But my load...
She's too good for a packhorse. 5
 silver pieces. You can buy 5 horses.
Boss. What shall we do?
Two horses are not enough
 for everything.
It's hard to find another one.
This sucks.
There is no time for girls.
Buy that girl back.
I cannot.
Why not? I am
 the Princess of Akizuki.
I can't bear to see one
 of our own in trouble.
No, you're in trouble...
Your kindness will harm you.
Whatever. Buy her back.
- No.
 - You cannot make my heart mute too!
A cart was a bad idea.
We're the horses now.
And we've even taken in that girl.
Stop following us. Go away.
Go back to Akizuki.
Don't stop. Continue.
Have you seen four people,
 three horses and a girl?
If you do, report them immediately.
It went well. We're lucky.
Who said a cart was a bad idea?
You were grumbling about the girl.
But those men are stupid.
 Why not check the wood?
What shall we do now?
Be calm!
Put it down.
Report them!
Run! Wait on the hill!
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!
Stand aside!
 You're no match for him!
A rare meeting.
I regret not meeting you on the
 battlefields this time around.
I regret it, too.
How about a duel?
With pleasure!
With what? A spear?
Sounds good.
All of them are inferior,
 but choose one.
I lost!
Wait!
We'll meet again.
Rokurota!
- Firewood?
 - What about firewood?
Apparently gold is hidden
 in the wood.
They're hiding here with all that.
Four of them.
 One girl with three men.
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.
The reward is 200 pieces
 of gold for her.
Five pieces just for information.
Don't jump the gun.
 It won't be easy.
A strong general, Rokurota Makabe,
 is with her.
It's cold!
It's been three days now.
- More rain. More rain.
 - What?
We can't move even if it stops.
We go out there
 and we'll get beheaded.
You madman.
 Are you glad to be beheaded?
Why not?
It's better than putting up
 with this.
Then give up the gold and get lost.
Good idea.
I'll leave.
But I'm taking all I can carry.
I'll be set for life.
I'll leave too.
Great. What's left is all mine.
Take what you want and beat it.
But we're not getting anywhere.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find something
 to put the gold in.
The one with the shorter one
 disappears for a while.
He's late.
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
What's going on?
 Everyone is carrying wood...
I know! It's the Fire Festival.
Haven't you heard of the Yamana
Fire Festival where the villagers dance around a bonfire?
We lucked out!
They're going in our direction.
 If we join the crowd...
I don't get it. Why do we have
 to patrol a Fire Festival?
Look. There's a lot
 of wood at the Festival.
The Akizuki clan may hide here
 with their gold hidden in firewood.
What's this?
There is too much wood to check.
We'll inspect the suspicious ones
 who stray from the crowd.
Where is everyone?
To the Festival...
Marching with the crowd...
The life of a man
Burn it with the fire
The life of an insect
Throw it into the fire
Ponder and you'll see
The world is dark
And this floating world is a dream
Burn with abandon
Burn it! Throw the cart
 into the fire!
No!
- Don't be stingy, fool.
 - No!
They're suspicious.
Move. Burn it!
Dance!
That's enough. Let's pack it up.
But, Boss, there's more...
Don't be greedy!
There's no point in taking more
 than we can carry.
You two carry 30 kan each.
I carry 40... with the two women,
 that's 20...
What? I can carry 40 kan too.
I'll carry 50 kan.
Hurry up!
It's such a shame to leave
 that gold.
Go back?
Where are you going?
No more.
What are you looking for?
Boss, help us!
Help!
If you want to live,
 pick up your load.
Follow me!
Hurry up! We can cross
 the mountain overnight.
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.
Then die.
Boss!
Calm down!
Don't stand up!
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
 Escape while you can.
We're done for. Let's run.
Farewell!
Did you say something?
I'm not worth it. Leave me and go.
It's the end.
If we get caught, they'll kill us.
Not if we don't have any gold.
We'll turn them in.
You're right.
 Maybe we'll even get a reward.
Idiot! They'll shoot us
 if we're not careful.
I'm sure Yamana and Hayakawa
 are patrolling their border.
We can report them there.
Your Highness... Hayakawa.
Are you joking? We got them
 and their gold long ago.
Go home, fools.
Look carefully! You won't see
 200 gold pieces again!
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!
She's a sight for sore eyes.
To think she'll be beheaded
 tomorrow...
Stay away!
Just a glance.
Let me through!
Tadokoro here to identify them.
Hyoe Tadokoro!
What happened to you?
Where did you get that scar?
You. You've changed.
Naturally.
Tell me what happened. We're on
opposite sides, but we're true friends.
Friends? Then why did you let me
 survive the shame of my defeat?
To defeat an enemy and to let him
live appears to be a kind act, but it is cruel.
Look at me!
My Lord shamed me
 before everyone.
See the scar left by
 the relentless beating?
I curse you!
Fool! Are you the
 great Hyoe Tadokoro?
What you make of another's
 kindness is up to you.
You and your Lord.
 Evidently you're both fools.
To punish you so for losing
 to an enemy...
Even I do not dare such a thing.
I'm the Princess. It's me.
Stop.
I appreciate your loyalty,
 but this is it.
I want to die with dignity.
Your Highness, this Rokurota
 cannot apologize enough.
You endured so much
 and it was all in vain.
You're wrong, Rokurota.
 I had a good time.
The happiness of these days
I would have never known living in the castle.
I saw people as they really are...
I saw their beauty and their
 ugliness with my own eyes.
Rokurota, I thank you.
- I can now die without regret.
 - Your Highness!
Rokurota.
That Fire Festival was fun.
I like that song.
The life of a man
Burn it with the fire
The life of an insect
Throw it into the fire
Ponder and you'll see
The world is dark
And this floating world is a dream
The life of a man
Burn it with the fire
Let's burn it!
Turn the horses!
Turn them, I said!
He's mad! Get them!
Hurry, Rokurota! Take the Princess!
She is a great leader...
 serve her well.
Hyoe!
Don't die in vain!
 If you wish, follow us!
Come!
Forgive this traitor!
Damn. When I got to Hayakawa
 with the gold,
I imagined I'd be so happy.
We're lucky to have our heads.
Let's stay friends.
We risked death together, we'll stay
 friends back at the village.
Stray horses.
Gold!
This is all mine.
What? Give me one of them.
I found them first.
You are greedy. You said we
 should split everything 50/50.
That was then, this is now.
You shithead.
You. Are you from the Akizuki clan?
No, we're just peasants.
I don't get it.
 Peasants with all this gold?
Arrest them!
Let's stay friends in heaven too.
Matashichi! Tahei! Look up!
What? It's me.
No wonder.
 Even I didn't recognize you.
Your armor becomes you.
Rokurota Makabe.
You look even more handsome.
You don't recognize
 your Princess Yuki?
The mute. The mute girl.
Matashichi. Tahei.
You two went through a lot for us.
However, that gold is an indispensable
 fund to restore Akizuki.
Not I, not even the Princess
 can take it.
I hope you will be satisfied
 with this. Here.
Split it fairly. No fighting.
You keep this.
No you keep it.
But...
Don't worry about it.
The End
Men, are you over 40?
When you wake up in the morning, do you feel tired and rundown?
Do you have that listless feeling?
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
This is Wednesday.
Seven weeks from the day you broke your leg. Yes or no?
Gunnison, how did you ever get to be such a big editor with such a small memory?
Thrift, industry and hard work.
And catching the publisher with his secretary.
Did I get the wrong day?
No.
No, wrong week.
Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
That's too bad, Jeff.
Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.
Forget I called.
Yeah, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.
Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast for another whole week.
That one week is gonna cost me my best photographer
and you a big assignment.
Where?
There's no point in even talking about it.
Oh, come on, come on. Where?
Kashmir.
Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning.
The place is about to go up in smoke.
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you that's the next place to watch?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave?
Half-hour? Hour?
With that cast on? You don't.
Stop sounding stuffy.
I can take pictures from a jeep or a water buffalo, if necessary.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with.
I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Morgan or Lambert.
That's fine.
I get myself half-killed for you, and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile racetrack.
You asked for something dramatically different. You got it.
So did you.
Goodbye, Jeff.
Now wait a minute, Gunnison.
You've got to get me out of here.
Six weeks sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors.
Bye, Jeff.
No, Gunnison, I...
If you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom,
I'm gonna do something drastic.
Like what?
"Like what?"
I'm gonna get married.
And then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
It's about time you got married,
before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah, can't you just see me?
Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife.
Jeff, wives don't nag anymore, they discuss.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss.
In my neighborhood, they still nag.
Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.
Yeah, have some good news the next time, huh?
Good morning. I said,
"Good morning!"
Oh, good morning.
Say, I wouldn't dig so deep if I were you.
You're giving them far too much water.
Why don't you shut up?
Well!
I do declare.
New York State sentence for a Peeping
Tom is six months in the workhouse.
Oh, hello, Stella.
And they got no windows in the workhouse.
You know, in the old days, they used to put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.
Any of those bikini bombshells you're always watching worth a red-hot poker?
Oh, dear. We've become a race of Peeping Toms.
What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change.
Yes, sir.
How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?
Reader's Digest,
April, 1939.
- Well, I only quote from the best.
- Yeah.
You don't have to take my temperature this morning.
Quiet. See if you can break 100.
You know, I should have been a gypsy fortune-teller instead of an insurance-company nurse.
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.
Just how did you do that, Stella?
Oh, simple.
I was nursing a director of General Motors.
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.
Then I asked myself, "What's General
Motors got to be nervous about?"
"Overproduction,"
I says. "Collapse."
When General Motors has to go to the bathroom 10 times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.
You know, Stella, in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market.
None whatsoever.
Crashed, didn't it?
I can smell trouble right here in this apartment.
First you smash your leg, then you get to looking out the window, see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.
I can see you in court now, surrounded by a bunch of lawyers in double-breasted suits.
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it was only a little bit of innocent fun.
"I love my neighbors, like a father."
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.
"You've just given birth to three years in Dannemora."
Right now I'd welcome trouble, you know.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell from a thermometer?
Those bathing beauties you've been watching haven't raised your temperature one degree in a month.
Here we go.
One more week.
No, I think you're right. I think there is gonna be trouble around here.
I knew it.
Ooh!
Do you ever heat that stuff?
Gives your circulation something to fight.
Oh, I see.
What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
You kidding?
She's a beautiful young girl, and you're a reasonably healthy young man.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
I just... I'm not ready for marriage.
Every man's ready for marriage when the right girl comes along.
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open.
She's all right.
- What'd you do, have a fight?
- No.
Father loading up the shotgun?
What?
Please, Stella.
It's happened before, you know.
Some of the world's happiest marriages have started "under the gun," as you might say.
No, she's just not the girl for me.
Yeah, she's only perfect.
She's too perfect.
She's too talented.
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.
She's too everything but what I want.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
What? It's very simple, Stella.
She belongs to that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, you know.
Expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties.
People with sense belong wherever they're put.
Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?
If she was only ordinary.
You never gonna get married?
I'll probably get married one of these days, but when I do, it's gonna be to someone who thinks of life not just as a new dress and a lobster dinner or latest scandal.
I need a woman who's willing to... Hold it.
Who's willing to go anywhere and do anything and love it.
So the honest thing for me to do is just call the whole thing off.
Let her find somebody else.
Yeah, I can hear you now.
"Get out of my life, you perfectly wonderful woman.
"You're too good for me."
Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm not an educated woman, but I can tell you one thing.
When a man and a woman see each other and like each other, they ought to come together, wham, like a couple of taxis on Broadway, and not sit around analyzing each other like two specimens in a bottle.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Intelligence.
Nothing has caused the human race so much trouble as intelligence.
Modern marriage.
No, we've progressed emotionally.
Baloney.
Once it was, "See somebody, get excited, get married."
Now it's, "Read a lot of books, fence with a lot of four-syllable words,
"psychoanalyze each other
"until you can't tell the difference between
"a petting party and a civil service exam."
People have different emotional levels...
When I married Myles, we were both a couple of maladjusted misfits.
We are still maladjusted misfits, and we have loved every minute of it.
Well, that's fine, Stella.
Now, would you fix me a sandwich, please?
Yes, I will.
And I'll spread a little common sense on the bread.
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips with love for you.
I got two words of advice for you.
Marry her.
She pay you much?
Oh!
There.
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.
Well, if you want anything, just ring.
Honey.
Come on.
Got to carry you over the threshold.
Window shopper.
How's your leg?
It hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And your love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Mmm-hmm.
Who are you?
Reading from top to bottom, Lisa
Carol
Fremont.
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Only because it's expected of her.
It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?
That depends on the quote, you know. Let's see now.
There's the airplane ticket over and import duties, hidden taxes, profit markup...
A steal at $1,100.
Eleven hundred?
They ought to list that dress on the stock exchange.
Why, we sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Who buys them, tax collectors?
Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it.
Just for the occasion.
Why, is something big going on somewhere?
It's going on right here.
It's a big night.
It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Well, I haven't noticed a big demand for tickets or anything.
That's because I bought out the house.
You know, this cigarette box has seen better days.
I picked that up in Shanghai, which has also seen better days.
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.
I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver one with just your initials engraved.
That's no way to spend your hard-earned money.
Well, I wanted to.
Oh!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at '21'?
You have, perhaps, an ambulance downstairs?
No, better than that. '21.'
Thank you for waiting, Carl. The kitchen's right there on the left.
Oh, I'll take the wine.
- Good evening, Mr. Jefferies.
- Carl.
Just put everything in the oven, Carl, on low.
- Yes, madam.
- Let's open the wine now.
All right.
It's a
Montrachet.
A great big glassful. There's a corkscrew right over there.
Here, I'll do it.
Big enough?
Yeah, they're fine.
I can't think of anything more boring or tiresome than what you've been through,
- and the last week must be the hardest.
- Let me, sir.
All right.
Yeah, I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Fine, thanks.
Just a minute, Carl.
This will take care of the taxi as well.
Thank you,
Miss Fremont.
Have a pleasant dinner,
Mr. Jefferies.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
What a day
I've had.
Are you tired?
Not a bit.
I was all morning in a sales meeting, then I had to dash to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne, who's just over from Paris with some spy reports.
And then I had to go to '21 ' and have lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people.
And that's when
I ordered dinner.
Then I had two fall showings 20 blocks apart.
Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward.
We're trying to get his new show.
And then I had to dash back and change.
Well, now, tell me. Tell me. Now, what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?
- Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
- She did.
She had on the most divine Italian hand-print
- mousseline de soie...
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.
- Italian. Imagine.
To think I planted three nice items in the columns about you today.
You did?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
I know.
Someday you may want to open up a studio of your own here.
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?
Jeff...
Isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.
For what?
For yourself and me.
I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow.
Don't laugh.
I could do it.
That's what
I'm afraid of.
Can you see me driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep, wearing combat boots and a three-day beard?
Wouldn't that make a hit?
I could see you looking very handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?
Hmm?
Guess I'd better start setting up for dinner.
To see you is to love you
And I see you everywhere
In the sunrise
In the moon glow
Any place I look you're there
To see you is to want you
And I see you all the time
On a sidewalk
In a doorway
On the lonely stairs I climb
Someday let me show you
How happy endings start
You'll find how well
I know you
'Cause to know you at all
Is to know you by heart
To see you is to love you
And you're never out of sight
And I love you and I'll see you
In the same old dream
Tonight
Miss Lonelyheart.
At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Oh?
You can see my apartment from here, all the way up on 63rd Street?
No, not exactly, but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.
You remember, of course, Miss
Torso, the ballet dancer?
She's like a queen bee with her pick of the drones.
I'd say she's doing a woman's hardest job. Juggling wolves.
Thank you.
Well, she picked the most prosperous-looking one.
She's not in love with him or any of them.
Oh, how can you tell that from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I hope they're cooked this time.
Where's that wonderful music coming from?
Some songwriter over there in the studio apartment.
Wow!
He lives alone. Probably had a very unhappy marriage.
Oh, it's enchanting.
It's almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Hmm.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
At least you can't say the dinner isn't right.
Lisa, it's perfect.
As always.
There can't be that much difference between people and the way they live.
We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, wear clothes.
Well, now look...
If you're saying all this because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand.
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that...
It doesn't make sense.
What's so different about it here from over there or anyplace you go that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now, if you'll just let me...
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures?
It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Okay. Now that's your opinion.
You're entitled to it. Now, let me give you my side.
It's ridiculous to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
I made a simple statement, a true statement, but I can back it up if you'd just shut up for a minute.
If your opinion is as rude as your manner, I don't think I care to hear it.
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.
I mean, according to you, people should be born, live and die on the same spot!
Shut up!
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
Well, you might have to if you went with me.
Did you ever try to keep warm in a C-54 at 15,000 feet, 20 degrees below zero?
Oh, I do it all the time. Whenever
I have a few minutes after lunch.
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?
Did you ever get sandbagged at night because somebody got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Did you ever... Those high heels, they'll be great in the jungle.
And the nylons and those six-ounce lingerie.
- Three.
- All right, three.
They'll make a big hit in Finland, just before you freeze to death.
Well, if there's one thing I know, it's how to wear the proper clothes.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.
Your home is the available transportation.
You don't sleep very much. You bathe less.
And sometimes the food that you eat is made from things that you couldn't even look at when they're alive.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Deliberately repulsive? I'm just trying to make it sound good.
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're not meant for that kind of a life.
Few people are.
You're too stubborn to argue with.
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.
I know, a lesser man would have told me it was one long holiday, and I would have been awakened to a rude disillusionment.
Oh, well now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be very happy to accommodate you.
No, I don't particularly want that.
So that's it?
You won't stay here, and I can't go with you.
It would be the wrong thing.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Right now it doesn't seem so.
I'm in love with you. I don't care what you do for a living.
I'd just like to be part of it somehow.
It's deflating to find out the only way I can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine.
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.
You've got this town in the palm of your hand.
Not quite, it seems.
Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean good night.
I mean what I said.
Well, Lisa, couldn't we just...
Uh...
Couldn't we just keep things status quo?
Without any future?
When am I gonna see you again?
Not for a long time.
At least not until tomorrow night.
Don't!
Hey! Rain.
Grab that. The rest of the blanket.
Wait, I'll get the clock.
Oh, no!
Put it in, now.
Pull on it.
Let me do it.
In you go.
No, you can't come in.
It's much too late.
No, no, not now. Get your foot out of the way. No, I said good night.
What's that supposed to be, ma'am?
It's called
"Hunger."
You'd think the rain would have cooled things off.
All it did was make the heat wet.
That's it.
That's it.
That's stiff one, right there.
Right there.
You know, the insurance company would be much happier if you'd sleep in bed at night instead of in that wheelchair.
How'd you know?
Eyes are all bloodshot.
Must have been watching out that window for hours.
Yeah, I was.
What are you gonna do if one of them catches you?
It depends which one.
Miss Torso, for example...
You keep your mind off her.
She sure is the "Eat, drink and be merry" girl.
Yeah, she'll wind up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Yeah.
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart.
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.
Poor soul.
Oh, well.
Maybe one day she'll find her happiness.
Yeah, and some man will lose his.
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood who could cast an eye in her direction?
I don't know.
It just might be that the salesman will be available soon.
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?
I just can't figure it.
He went out several times last night in the rain, carrying his sample case.
Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?
What would he be selling at 3:00 in the morning?
Flashlights.
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I think he was taking something out of the apartment.
Uh-huh.
His personal effects.
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low type of man to do a thing like that.
How about this morning?
Any further developments?
The shades are all drawn in the apartment.
- In this heat?
- Yeah.
Well, they're up now.
Get back!
Get back!
Where do you want me to go?
Come on, get out of sight.
Get out of sight.
What is it?
What's the matter?
That salesman's looking out of his window. You see?
Get back!
He'll see you.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
That's no ordinary look.
That's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Get away from there. Get away from there.
He'll be after you.
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
And don't sleep in that chair again.
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh.
Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.
Stella.
Take those binoculars out of the case and bring them here, will you?
Trouble.
I can smell it.
I'll be glad when they crack that cast, and I can get out of here.
Uh-huh.
How far does a girl have to go before you'll notice her?
Well, if she's pretty enough, she doesn't have to go anywhere.
She just has to "be."
Well, ain't I?
Pay attention to me.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Your mind is...
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Why...
Why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase, and come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
No, no. No, no.
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.
And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
What's interesting about a butcher knife and a small saw wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
There's something terribly wrong.
And I'm afraid it's with me.
What do you think?
Something too frightful to utter.
He went out a few minutes ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back yet.
That'd be a terrible job to tackle.
Just how would you start to cut up a human body?
Jeff, I'll be honest with you. You're beginning to scare me a little.
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare...
Shh! Shh!
He's coming back!
Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
What's the matter?
Sitting around looking out of the window to kill time is one thing, but doing it the way you are, with binoculars and wild opinions about every little thing you see, is diseased!
What, do you think I consider it recreation?
I don't know what you consider it, but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.
What's the...
What is it you're looking for?
I just want to find out what's the matter with the salesman's wife, that's all.
Does that make me sound like a madman?
What makes you think there's something the matter with her?
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day. Why?
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.
There is something... I've seen it through that window.
I've seen bickering and family quarrels and mysterious trips at night and knives and saws and ropes.
And now, since last evening, not a sign of the wife.
All right. Now you tell me where she is.
- I don't know.
- What's she doing? Where is she?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!
Lots of people have knives and saws and ropes around their houses.
And lots of men don't speak to their wives all day.
Lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts, but very, very few of them end up in murder, if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard for you to keep away from that word, isn't it?
- You could see all that he did, couldn't you? - Of course...
You could see because the shades were up and he walked along the corridor and the street and the backyard.
I've seen him in the backyard, fixing the flowers...
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that?
That he wouldn't pull the shades down and hide behind them?
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.
And that's where you're not being clever.
A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window.
Why not?
Why, for all you know, there's probably something a lot more sinister going on behind those windows.
Where?
Oh!
No comment.
Let's start from the beginning again, Jeff.
Tell me everything you saw and what you think it means.
Yeah?
The name on the second floor
rear mail box reads,
"Mr. and Mrs. Lars."
That's L-A-R-S.
Lars Thorwald.
What's the number of the apartment house?
125 West
9th Street.
Thank you, dear.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment?
Just go home.
All right, but what's he doing now?
He's just sitting in the living room in the dark.
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.
Now you go home and get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
All right.
What's it all about, Jeff?
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.
You have to be here and see the whole setup.
Important, huh?
Well, it's probably nothing important at all.
It's just a little neighborhood murder, that's all.
Did you say
"murder," Jeff?
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder."
Oh, come now.
My only thought was throwing a little business your way, that's all.
I figured a good detective would jump at the chance of something to detect.
- I'm not working.
- What?
This happens to be my day off.
Well, I usually took my best pictures on my day off.
I'll drop by.
Okay, Doyle. All right.
As soon as you can.
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.
I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is.
No wonder your husband still loves you.
- The police.
- What?
You called the police.
Well, not exactly.
Not an official call. It's just an old friend of mine.
An old, ornery friend of mine.
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?
Of course.
The bathtub.
That's the only place where he could have washed away the blood.
He better get that trunk out of there before it starts to leak.
Harry?
Look, look,
Mr. Jefferies.
I thought Doyle would be here by the time the trunk left, or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.
I'm just gonna get the name off that freight truck.
I'll keep an eye on the alley.
Long distance.
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?
Because everything this fellow's done has been suspicious.
Trips at night in the rain, and knives and saws and trunks with rope and now this wife that isn't there anymore.
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least plausible.
Doyle, don't tell me he's an unemployed magician, amusing the neighborhood with his sleight of hand. Don't tell me that.
It's too obvious and stupid a way to commit murder.
In full view of 50 windows?
Then sit over there smoking a cigar, waiting for the police to come and pick him up?
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.
Jeff, you've got a lot to learn about homicide.
Why, morons have committed murder so shrewdly, it's taken a hundred trained police minds to catch them.
That salesman wouldn't just knock his wife off after dinner and toss her in the trunk and put her in storage.
I'll bet it's been done.
Most everything's been done, under panic.
This is a thousand-to-one shot.
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.
You think I made all this up?
Well, I think you saw something.
There's probably a very simple explanation for that.
For instance?
Wife took a trip.
His wife was sick in bed.
Yeah, so you told me.
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.
No sense in your getting a lot of ridiculous publicity.
Thank you.
We know the wife is gone, so I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
You had any headaches lately?
Not until you showed up.
It'll wear off, along with the hallucinations.
See you around.
Get along.
He has a six months' lease.
Used up a little more than five and a half months of it.
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.
Pays his bills promptly with money earned as a costume jewelry salesman.
Wholesale.
Kept to himself. None of his neighbors got close to him or his wife.
Yeah, well, I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment...
- Where is she? The icebox?
- ...until yesterday morning.
- What time?
- 6:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Too bad.
Thorwalds were leaving their apartment at just that time.
Feel a little foolish?
No, not yet.
How's your wife?
Oh, she's fine.
Who said they left then?
Who left where?
The Thorwalds, at 6:00 in the morning.
Oh, the building superintendent and two tenants.
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.
Thorwalds were on their way to the railroad station.
Well, now, Tom, how could anybody possibly guess that?
What, did they have signs on their luggage, saying, "Grand Central or bust?"
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.
Thorwald told him that he'd put his wife on a train to the country.
I see. I'd say this is a pretty convenient guy, this superintendent.
Have you checked his bank statements lately?
Huh?
Well, what good's his information?
It's a secondhand version of an unsupported story by the murderer himself, Thorwald.
Now did anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I hate to remind you, but this all started because you said she was murdered.
Now, did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
What are you doing?
Are you interested in solving this case or in making me look foolish?
Well, if possible, both.
Well, then, do a good job of it.
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.
It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do that.
Well, no, I don't mean right now, but when he goes out for a drink, or a paper, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I can't do that, even if he isn't there.
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card from the police department, or something?
Now don't get me mad.
Not even a detective can walk into an apartment and search it.
If I were caught in there, they'd have my badge within 10 minutes.
All right. Make sure you don't get caught, that's all.
What? If you find something, you've got a murderer, and they don't care anything about a couple of house rules.
If you don't find anything, the fellow's clear.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd like to remind you of the Constitution and the phrase, "Search warrant issued by a judge
"who knows his Bill of Rights verbatim."
He must ask for evidence.
Give him evidence.
Yeah, I can hear myself.
"Your Honor, I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth.
"Well, the other night after having a heavy dinner, he..."
He'd throw the New York State penal code right in my face.
And there's six volumes.
You know, by tomorrow morning there may not be any evidence left over in that apartment.
You know that.
It's a detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search?
Tell me. Now, what do you need?
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.
How did we ever stand each other in that plane for three years during the war?
I guess I'll go over to the railroad station and check on Thorwald's story.
Oh, forget about the story.
Find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald's in it.
Oh, I almost forgot.
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was mailed 3:30 yesterday afternoon from Merritsville.
That's 80 miles north of here.
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better.
"Love, Anna."
Oh...
Is that...
Anna... Is that who I think it is?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?
You might send me a good detective.
Many dreams ago
I dreamed many dreams
Waiting for my true love
To appear
Though each night it seems
Someone filled my dreams
Still the face
That I kissed wasn't clear
So I let my heart dance
To many sweet refrains
But now just one song
And just one dream remains
That one song is you
And at last I know
You're the one I dreamed of
Many dreams ago
- Hello?
- Hello, Miss Doyle?
Yes?
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You mean you haven't even heard from him?
Not a word. Is it something really important, Jeff?
Yeah, I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
No, no, don't bother to do that.
Just have him get over here as soon as he can.
Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Who's Thorwald?
He'll know, he'll know.
And Thorwald's a man,
Tess, don't worry.
- Good night, you idiot.
- Good night.
Long distance again.
There's somebody at the door.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hello.
What'd you do to your hair?
- Oh, well, I just sort of...
- Take a look at Thorwald.
He's getting ready to pull out for good.
Look at him.
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
He's been laying out all his things on one of the beds.
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.
Even his wife's...
That alligator handbag
- his wife had on the bedpost.
- What about it?
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.
He took it out, went to the telephone and made a long-distance call.
He had his wife's jewelry in the handbag.
Seemed worried about it.
Asked somebody's advice over the telephone.
Someone not his wife.
Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.
She volunteered plenty, but I never saw him ask her for any.
I wonder where he's going.
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He'll be back. His things are still there.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
No, not yet!
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must have gone someplace to the right.
All day long, I've been trying to keep my mind on my work.
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you and your friend, Doyle.
Did you hear from him again, since he left?
Not a word.
He said he was gonna check the railroad station and the trunk.
He must be still at it.
Something on your mind?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Mmm.
Well, I can't guess what you're thinking.
A woman has a favorite handbag and it always hangs on her bedpost, where she can get at it easily.
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip.
And where she's going, she wouldn't need the handbag.
Yes, but only her husband would know that.
And that jewelry.
Women don't keep their jewelry in a purse getting all twisted and scratched and tangled up.
Well, do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not.
And they don't leave it behind, either.
Why, a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?
It's basic equipment.
And you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I'm with you, sweetie. I'm with you.
Tom Doyle has a pat answer for that, though.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at 6:00 a.m. yesterday with her husband?
According to those witnesses.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.
That couldn't have been
Mrs. Thorwald, or I don't know women.
What about the witnesses?
We'll agree they saw a woman, but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.
That is, not yet.
Is that so?
Come here.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him.
He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.
I sure wish he'd show up.
Don't rush him.
We have all night.
- We have all what?
- Night.
I'm going to stay with you.
Well, you'll have to clear that with my landlord.
I have the whole weekend off.
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.
If you say anything else, I'll stay tomorrow night, too.
I won't be able to give you any pajamas.
You said I'll have to live out of one suitcase.
I'll bet yours isn't this small.
This is a suitcase?
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case, anyway.
Compact, but ample enough.
Looks like you packed in a hurry.
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?
I'll trade you...
My feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I'll go along with that.
There's that song again.
Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?
Well, he gets it from the landlady once a month.
It's utterly beautiful.
I wish I could be creative.
Oh, sweetie, you are.
You have a great talent for creating difficult situations.
- I do?
- Sure.
Like staying here all night uninvited.
Surprise is the most important element of attack.
And besides, you're not up on your private eye literature.
When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Is she the girl that saves them from the clutches of the seductive showgirls and the over-passionate daughters of the rich?
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?
It's funny. He never ends up marrying her, does he?
That's strange.
Weird.
Why don't I slip into something more comfortable?
By all means.
I mean, like the kitchen and make us some coffee.
Oh, and some brandy, too, huh?
Harry.
- Jeff.
- Hi.
What else have you got on this man Thorwald?
Well, enough to scare me you wouldn't show up in time and we'd lose him.
Think he's getting out of here?
Look, he's got everything he owns laid out over there in the bedroom, waiting to be packed.
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?
Tom, this is
Miss Lisa Fremont.
How do you do?
We think Thorwald's guilty.
Careful, Tom.
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Doyle.
Yeah, he's right here.
For you.
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?
Speaking.
Yeah.
All right.
I see. Thank you. Goodbye.
Coffee will be ready soon.
Jeff, aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry?
Jewelry?
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in his clothes in the bedroom over there.
You sure it belonged to his wife?
It was in her favorite handbag.
Mr. Doyle, that can only lead to one conclusion.
Namely?
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that left with him yesterday morning.
You figured that out, eh?
Well, it's simply that women don't leave their jewelry behind when they go on a trip.
Come on, come on, Tom.
Now you don't really need any of this information, do you?
As a matter of fact, I don't.
Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer than I am.
You mean to say you can explain everything that's gone on over there, and is still going on?
No, neither can you.
That's a secret, private world you're looking into out there.
People do a lot of things in private they couldn't possibly explain in public.
Like disposing of their wives?
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.
What about the knife and the saw?
Did you ever own a saw?
Well, at home in the garage I had...
How many people did you cut up with it?
Or with the couple of hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Well, your logic is backward.
You can't ignore the wife disappearing and the trunk and the jewelry.
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.
Ten minutes later, he put his wife on a train.
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.
That might have been a woman, but it couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.
- That jewelry...
- Look, Miss Fremont.
That feminine intuition stuff sells magazines.
But in real life, it's still a fairy tale.
I don't know how many wasted years I've spent tracking down leads based on female intuition.
All right. I take it you didn't find the trunk, and all this is from an old speech you once made at the Policemen's Ball.
I found the trunk a half-hour after I left here.
I suppose it's normal for a man to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?
Well, if the lock is broken, yes.
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.
Didn't you take them off to the crime lab?
I sent them on their merry and legal way.
Why, when a woman is taking a simple, short trip, does she take everything she owns?
Let's let the female psychology department handle that one.
I would say it looked as if she wasn't coming back.
That's what's known as a family problem.
And if she wasn't coming back, why didn't he tell his landlord?
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his landlord.
Because he was hiding something.
Do you tell your landlord everything?
I told you to be careful, Tom.
Look, if I'd have been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane during the war, you wouldn't have had the chance to take the pictures that won you a medal, and a good job, and fame and money.
What do you say we all sit down and have a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?
Forget all about this.
We can tell lies about the good old days during the war.
You mean you're through with the case?
There is no case to be through with, Miss Fremont.
How about that drink?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, I think I better get home and get some sleep.
Cheers.
Not much of a snifter.
Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...
Consult the Yellow Pages in your telephone directory.
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.
Who was that trunk addressed to?
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Well, then let's wait and find out who picks it up.
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.
I hope you don't mind.
Depends on who they were.
The police at
Merritsville.
They reported the trunk was just picked up by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Don't stay up too late.
- Look.
- What?
Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?
What are you doing?
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J.
Doyle too much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said that was pretty private stuff going on out there.
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long-focus lens.
Do you... Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you prove that he didn't commit a crime?
I'm not much on rear-window ethics.
Of course, they can do the same thing to me.
Watch me like a bug under a glass, if they want to.
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here, they wouldn't believe what they'd see.
What?
You and me with long faces.
Plunged into despair because we find out a man didn't kill his wife.
We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
You'd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well.
Whatever happened to that old saying, "Love thy neighbor"?
You know, I think I'll start reviving that tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll begin with Miss Torso.
Not if I have to move into an apartment across the way and do the Dance of the
Seven Veils every hour.
Show's over for tonight.
Preview of coming attractions.
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.
What do you think?
Well...
I will rephrase the question.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.
Well...
What's the matter?
- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog.
Something's happened to the dog.
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?
See, it's a dog down there.
It's dead.
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.
Which one of you did it?
Which one of you killed my dog?
You don't know the meaning of the word "Neighbors."
Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies.
But none of you do!
But I couldn't imagine any of you being so low that you'd kill a little helpless, friendly dog.
The only thing in this whole neighborhood who liked anybody.
Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?
Let's go inside.
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
- But you're not?
- Look.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Look.
Why would Thorwald want to kill a little dog?
Because it knew too much?
You think this is worth waiting all day to see?
Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Hmm.
Must have splattered a lot.
Well, why not? That's what we're all thinking.
He killed her in there, he has to clean up those stains before he leaves.
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.
Nobody ever invented a polite word for a killing yet.
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf, there's a little yellow box. You see it?
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.
Bring it. And bring me the viewer there.
I just got a...
Now, these are about two weeks old.
I hope I took something else besides leg art. Now which one...
- What are you looking for?
- Here.
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.
- Mrs. Thorwald?
- No.
No, the dog.
Uh-huh.
I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.
Now take it down.
Now look again. Now take it down.
You see?
But it's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
One important change.
One important change.
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.
You mean where the dog was sniffing around?
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.
Look, right? Those two yellow zinnias on this end aren't as tall as they were.
Now, since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
There's something buried there.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You haven't spent much time around cemeteries, have you?
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely put his wife's body in a plot of ground about one foot square.
Unless, of course, he put her in standing on end, and then he wouldn't need a knife and saw.
No, my idea is she's scattered all over town.
- Leg in the East River...
- Oh, Stella, please!
No, no, no. There's something in there.
Those flowers have been taken out and put back in.
- Maybe it's the knife and saw.
- Yeah.
Call Lieutenant Doyle.
No, let's wait.
Let's wait till it gets a little darker, and I'll go over there and dig them up.
You'll go? You won't dig anything up and get your neck broken.
No, no, we've...
We're not gonna call Doyle until I can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.
What we've got to do is find a way to get into that apartment.
He's packing.
Uh-oh.
Here, get me a pencil.
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.
There it is.
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...
Look. Look. Look.
Well, thank heaven that's over.
All right if I have a drink?
Sure, go ahead.
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?
Go ahead, just as long as you tell me what you're looking at.
I wonder...
Wonder what?
Miss Lonelyheart's just laid out something that looks like rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.
You can tell from here?
I've handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in Hackensack to sleep for the winter.
Well, does she have enough of them to...
No. It will make the rest easy to...
Wasn't that close?
What was his reaction. I mean, when he looked at the note?
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank.
Jeff, the handbag!
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring is among the jewelry he has in that handbag?
Now, during the phone conversation he held up three rings.
One with a diamond, one with a big stone of some sort and then just a plain gold band.
And the last thing she would leave behind would be a wedding ring.
Stella, do you ever leave yours at home?
The only way anybody could get that ring would be to chop off my finger.
Let's go down and find out what's buried in the garden.
Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.
- What are you two talking about?
- You got a shovel?
A shovel? Of course I don't have a shovel.
There's probably one in the basement.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.
I just don't want you two to end up like that dog ended up. That's all.
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he might just have something there.
Just hold on.
Here, take this.
No sense taking any chances in this thing.
Here, give me the phone book.
What for?
Maybe I can get him out of that apartment.
We only need a few minutes.
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.
How?
Thorwald.
Thorwald...
Thorwald...
Chelsea 27099.
We scared him once, maybe we can scare him again.
Well, I guess I'm using that word "we" a little freely.
I mean, you're taking all the chances.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Unanimously.
27099. Look out.
Chelsea.
Chelsea.
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.
Go on, you're curious.
You wonder if it's your girlfriend calling, the one you killed for.
Go on, pick it up.
Hello?
Did you get my note?
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?
Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out.
Meet me in the bar at the Albert Hotel.
Do it right away.
Why should I?
A little business meeting...
To settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald, or
I'll hang up and call the police.
I have only
$100 or so.
That's a start.
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.
Come on, Stella, let's go.
One of you keep an eye on this window.
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.
This is the Doyle residence.
Hello, this is L. B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.
Who's this?
This is a babysitter.
Oh. Uh...
When do you expect them in?
Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went to dinner and maybe a nightclub.
I see.
If he calls in, would you have him get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away?
I might have quite a surprise for him.
Well, do we have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it.
Good night.
Good night.
Stella was wrong about Miss Lonelyheart.
Lisa, what are you...
Don't do...
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...
Come on, come on!
Get out of there!
She said ring Thorwald's phone the second you see him come back.
I'm gonna ring it right now!
Oh, no. Give her another minute.
All right, fellows, let's try it once from the beginning.
Miss Lonelyheart.
Oh, call the police!
Operator.
Get me the police, sixth precinct.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Jefferies, the music stopped her.
What... Lisa!
Lisa!
Precinct 6,
Sergeant Allgood.
Hello. Hello. Look, a man is assaulting a woman at 125 West 9th Street.
Second floor, at the rear.
Make it fast!
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 25598.
The door was open.
- I told you...
- Oh, no!
Let go of me! Jeff!
Oh, no!
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff!
Lisa!
Stella, what do we do?
Jeff!
- Jeff!
- Well, here they come.
What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?
She's a smart girl.
"Smart girl"? She'll get herself arrested.
It'll get her out of there, won't it?
Look, the wedding ring!
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!
How long do you think he'll stay there?
Well, unless he's dumber than I think he is, he won't wait until his lease is up.
Get my billfold out of the drawer in the table there.
What do you need money for?
I'm gonna bail
Lisa out of jail.
You know, you could leave her there till next Tuesday, then you could sneak safely away as planned.
Yeah, let's see. $127.
How much do you need?
Well, this is first-offense burglary, that's about $250.
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.
How much does she have?
Fifty cents.
Here, take this.
Look, I got $20 or so in my purse.
What about the rest?
What about the rest?
When those cops see Lisa, they'll even contribute.
Well, hurry up.
Just a minute.
Hurry up!
Jefferies.
All right.
What is it now?
Doyle, I've got something really big for you.
Why did I have to return your call?
Look, Jeff! Don't louse up my night with another mad killer...
Listen to me! Listen to me! Lisa's in jail.
She got arrested.
- Your Lisa?
- My Lisa.
Boy, you should have seen her. She got into Thorwald's apartment.
But then he came back, and the only way I could get her out was to call the police.
- I told you...
- I know you told me!
She went in to get evidence and she came out with evidence.
- Like what?
- Like what?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.
If that woman was alive, she'd be wearing that ring. Right?
- A possibility.
- A possibility. It's a fact!
He killed a dog last night because the dog was scratching around in the garden.
You know why? Because he had something buried in that garden that the dog scented.
Like an old ham bone?
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife, but I'll tell you this, all those trips at night with that metal suitcase, he wasn't taking out his possessions, because his possessions are still up in the apartment.
Perhaps it was old "ham bone."
Yeah, in sections.
And I'll tell you something else.
All the telephone calls he made were long distance, all right?
Now, if he called his wife long distance on the day she left, after she arrived in Merritsville, why did she write a card to him saying that she'd arrived in Merritsville?
Why did she do that?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct 6.
I sent somebody over with the bail money.
Maybe you won't need it.
I'll run it down, Jeff.
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?
This fellow knows he's being watched.
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort.
- So long, Jeff.
- So long.
Hello. Hello. Tom, I think Thorwald's left.
I don't see...
Hello...
What do you want from me?
Your friend, the girl, could have turned me in.
Why didn't she?
What is it you want? A lot of money?
I don't have any money.
Say something.
Say something! Tell me what you want!
Can you get me that ring back?
No.
Tell her to bring it back!
I can't. The police have it by now.
Lisa! Doyle!
Over there!
Look! Look, over in that apartment!
Doyle!
Creele!
Give me your .38!
I'm sorry, Jeff. I got here as fast as I could!
Oh, Mr. Jefferies! Don't let anybody touch him.
Get my medical bag from upstairs.
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, if anything had happened to you...
Oh, shut up.
I'm all right.
Gee, I'm proud of you!
You got enough for a search warrant now?
Oh, yeah, sure.
- Lieutenant Doyle!
- Yeah?
Is he okay?
He's alive.
Thorwald's ready to take us on a tour of the East River.
Did he say what was buried in the flower bed?
Yeah. He said the dog got too inquisitive, so he dug it up.
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.
- Want to look?
- No, thanks.
I don't want any part of her.
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.
I'd love to hear it.
I can't tell you what this music has meant to me.
Lisa, with your starry eyes
Now, let's try it again, puppy.
Stay still. Stay.
Hold me and whisper the sweet words I'm yearning for
Drown me in kisses
- Stanley!
- Hi, baby!
Caresses I'm burning for
My, look what the
Army's done for you!
Lisa, every touch is new ecstasy
The Army's made me hungry. What've you got in the icebox to eat?
Boy, it's good to be home.
Lisa, angels dance when you cling to me
I don't care if you help me or not, but if you'd told me you'd quit your job, we wouldn't have gotten married.
Oh, honey, come on...
If this is dreaming
I hope I'll never wake
But dream forever
In your arms, oh, Lisa
Lisa
Arnold, you know, god wants to get close to you.
Look, let god into your life.
Don't... this work is not gonna help you.
This is... this is the work of the devil.
Oh, Candace, why are you doing this kind of work?
You could do so much.
You could help people so much more because you're a nice lady.
God wants you too... especially wants you, Candace, to be close to him.
Can't you do some other kind of work?
This is not right.
You have grandchildren.
Don't you know how precious they are?
These little babies are precious.
Life is precious.
Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen.
- Holy Mary...
- man: Ain't the dogs come out?
I'd like to offer this to you, miss.
- We can help you.
- Man: We got a place next door.
- Y'all can? Then give me some money.
- Maybe we can help you out.
We'll help you out right next door.
That's what they do.
Mary: Oh, mothers... please, dear mothers.
Mothers... you're a mother of a baby right now.
Don't have this abortion.
Choose life.
Woman: You need to know the facts about abortion.
God made you pregnant.
It's not a mistake.
We're here to help you.
There is so much help available.
Even right across the street there's help.
Come on, please. Wait...
Think about yourself.
95% of women will tell you they regret their abortion.
You're not gonna be different.
This just makes everything worse.
Trust me.
Oh, where's my baby?
Around this time he goes for the... killer...
That's what an abortionist is...
And he'll zoom out of here in his white...
In his yellow... what's that?
A car, mustang, or whatever it's called.
I don't know cars.
But that's what he does.
Then he'll come back a half an hour later with the...
Ahem, quotation marks...
"doctor" under a sheet.
I don't know what they tell the people inside what we do.
- See, there he goes.
Here he goes.
See, and I'll stand...
I'll stand in front of the car
'cause I know his sched...
Oh, hi there, miss. Hi.
You know, you haven't got much time for the baby to live.
But... I know, it's not your... but it's...
This is your baby... this...
No, but you're here to help this woman have an abortion.
Hello, Arnold. Hi.
Hello, Arnold.
See this? Huh? Huh?
See these little babies here?
Look at this...
This was your granddaughter.
That's your granddaughter that you love so much.
This is your granddaughter.
That's how she was.
And these are the size of these babies here.
Why do you do this kind of work, Arnold, huh?
That's choice for you, right?
That's choice.
Okay, it shows positive.
Okay?
It shows you at about 10 weeks, okay?
Which is about this size here.
Okay? You can hold it.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Um, are you surprised?
It's okay.
It's okay to be nervous, all right?
Just wanna let you know that.
So we would like to offer you an ultrasound, okay?
Is that something that you think your mom would like to be here for?
Are you close with your mom?
- Not really.
- Not really? Okay.
Do you wanna have your sister come in?
- Her test has shown positive.
- Ugh!
Widline...
Woman: You can put her at 11:30.
Anne: She just got out of school.
She's 15. She's in school.
She's not communicating at all.
Just turns her head.
I wanna go inside.
I just wanna get it done with.
Brittney?
Well, actually I'll just see brittney first, okay?
- Man: Okay.
- All right. You can have a seat.
When you say one pregnancy, are you counting this as a pregnancy or you had a previous pregnancy?
- I had one before.
- You had one before?
- It ended in abortion or it ended in miscarriage or... - an abortion.
So you're considering abortion as your number-one option?
Yeah, I don't feel ready for... for the baby.
I don't have insurance.
I don't have a job, you know.
What motivated the abortion decision the first time?
- Um, I think... - just the same... just uncertainty or...
No, I... in the beginning
I wanted to keep it, but my mom didn't want me to because she said that it was gonna ruin my life and stuff.
So I just... I don't know.
I didn't want my mom to be mad at me and...
I don't know.
Do you think she would react the same now?
I think she'd be more mad.
- Yeah?
- Now, yeah.
- I think she'd be really upset.
- Yeah.
- I don't really wanna tell her.
- Right.
Well, you know, at this point there's not really a whole...
There's not reason, really, to rush off to tell her.
Looks like you'd be at about seven weeks.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Seven weeks is about this size here...
The littlest one.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?
- The growth is pretty quickly.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they grow pretty quickly.
It's kind of an amazing thing.
- And that's how big it is?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
That's how big he is at seven weeks.
You can take him out.
We can get you in to have an ultrasound and just...
You know, so you know we do offer free ultrasound, because it's a visual, you know?
It shows you what's happening inside there.
Got him.
- Woman: There's the baby right there.
- Mm-hmm.
If you look real close, you can see his little heart beating.
Right there.
If you look real close, it's flickering.
- It's quiet, but you can hear it.
- Mm-hmm.
Anne: You can see it too.
- Woman: There, you see?
- Oh, yeah.
Man: Oh my gosh.
It's pretty tiny, but definitely there with the heartbeat.
- That's crazy.
- Right?
Um...
Anne: And the baby doubles in size every week, so next week it'll be twice that.
- Man: Wow.
- In the beginning they grow at an amazing rate.
Yeah, like you can see...
This is seven weeks and this is eight weeks.
You know?
So they do grow pretty quickly.
Man: Oh, yeah.
Wow.
You want me to drive?
Hmm?
- Huh?
- I'll drive.
I'll drive.
Gosh... "Hi, mommy and daddy."
- That's tough.
- I know.
Tony: You're not defending it.
You're letting it be murdered.
It's the same thing as have somebody kidnap your son and beat him to death.
The difference is your son can speak up.
This child cannot speak.
So someone has to stand up for it.
You're not.
And you can ignore me all you want.
You can ignore me all you want.
You're gonna stand before god and before Jesus...
Have to give account of this.
What are you gonna say?
"Oh, I didn't want it"?
"I couldn't afford it"?
Wrong answer.
- I have one for your record books.
- Huh?
For your memories of freaky things that happen in the United States.
It's this breaking news on the operation rescue website.
Philadelphia women's center on Tuesday had free abortions in honor of George tiller.
- That's not a joke?
- This is totally not a joke.
Yes, and they're proud of it.
They did it in honor of tiller, late-term abortionist.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah. Sick.
- Well, here they come.
- Yeah.
They came down the other way of the street.
Anne: You wonder what's the, like, keyword.
You know, "we're in" or
"cover down" or... you know.
Man: Come on out.
Oh my gosh, could you imagine if it came out like an albino?
- Oh.
- Don't worry.
Girl: No, like, white hair and red eyes.
Oh my god.
No, it really is.
I know an albino person.
This is Satan's baby.
Ew.
You can get breast cancer from an abortion?
Girl #2: I don't know, man.
Girl: That's, like, not cool though.
It's scary.
Hello, brittney?
Hi, this is Anne calling from the pregnancy care center.
How are you? Good good.
I was... I was hoping that I'd be able to reach you today.
You doing okay?
Yeah?
How...
You're what?
Did you... did you make any progress towards making a decision or...
How are you? Yeah?
And?
Yeah.
Did you go through with it already?
Yeah?
Well...
Yeah. Okay.
She aborted.
She aborted.
That was very quick.
They must have aborted on Saturday.
I'm sure they did it across the street.
I'm sure.
I think that even though it's hard and, you know,
I go through things like this, my situation makes me the perfect person to do a job like this.
I'm an unmarried person with very few responsibilities in terms of other things that I have to tend to.
It's basically my two dogs and myself that I have charge of, you know.
And...
I think I'm at a point where I do really understand that this battle is just so vicious and that the evil is...
So powerful and so brutal that I really think god's doing everything he can.
It will end. I know that.
I just don't think it's gonna be pretty.
Anne: The abortion clinic in fort Pierce is run by a wife and a husband.
They're doing it because that's their paycheck.
It's like walking into a car dealership...
They want to sell you a car.
And walking into an abortion clinic...
They want to sell you an abortion.
You're not going to get the truth.
You're not gonna get neutrality.
You're gonna get a sales pitch.
Clearly our competition is the abortion clinic.
We are actually on opposite sides of the street.
You know, abortion clinic, pregnancy care center.
You know, darkness and light.
You know, death and life.
I mean, it doesn't get more distinct than that.
We have two women who call...
She's fearless or she's fearful.
That's it.
If she's fearless, she's not even saying hello.
She's, "hey, how much do you charge for abortion?"
I need to make an appointment for an abortion."
She's often times rushed.
If you don't hook her right away, she hangs up on you.
When she calls and she says,
"do you do abortions?"
I say,
"are you calling for yourself or are you calling for your friend?"
She says, "I'm calling for myself."
I say, "well, when did you have a pregnancy test?"
And we engage in conversation.
Because if she calls and says,
"do you do abortions?"
And I say no... click.
They're not always sure who they're calling anyway.
They don't know if they're calling us or the abortion clinic.
But again, I'm not trying to talk her out of it.
I'm trying to get her in the door.
Take control of the conversation.
There's a lot at stake here.
I don't mind the criticisms of "taking control" doesn't... that doesn't sound fair.
That doesn't sound...
Well, then too bad.
You walk her to the room, you sit her down, you close the door, you excuse yourself and you come back.
It's okay that they're sit in the room by themselves, because inevitably what do they do when they're in there by themselves?
They read.
And since we're the ones putting out what is read in the room, we know it's good information.
And there's no deceit in this, okay?
There's no deceit. Trust me.
And whenever I have any doubt about any direction,
I ask father Tom.
Look at this morally.
You know, look at this from an ethical point of view.
Is this okay to say?
Is this okay to do?
And he examines it.
And trust me, if it weren't okay, he wouldn't allow me to do it.
Here, Arnold, see the baby? See?
See the little baby, huh?
Doctor, you don't have to do this kind of work.
These are what you kill.
Huh? Look.
Are those... scumbag.
Father Tom euteneuer:
When we dedicate ourselves heart and soul to pro-life, we are doing something prophetic.
My friends, as we go on in our society in the future,
I predict that it's going to get a lot more difficult to be pro-life.
The forces on the other side are solidifying their power...
Their political power, their social power...
And they're becoming more militant against us...
Because the abortion industry is more and more looking like a diabolical religion.
Think about it.
In the United States, most of the abortions are done in these free-standing abortion clinics.
They're like temples because inside that clinic you have an altar, which is the abortion table.
On that altar they offer up a blood sacrifice.
It's ritualized blood sacrifice.
There's got to be demons involved in that.
There are policemen who protect it.
They're kind of like their guardian angels.
They have their hierarchy called planned parenthood.
They have their dogma called choice, and they enforce that dogma.
For them it's an infallible dogma.
So my friends, we're talking about something deeply diabolical at the core of our country because the forces that we are fighting are not flesh and blood, but they are the powers of darkness.
Anne: Arnold does all the pick-up of the abortionists and they use a bright yellow mustang.
This is supposed to be not drawing attention to the whole abortionists coming in to the abortion, though?
And you can hear the car...
Voom... start up.
In fact, in my office
I can hear it.
They painted their building gaudy orange.
They... we don't know what their tactic was on that, but it might have been a way for them to be able to say to their own clients, you know, "come to the bright orange building as opposed to that other one," because they thought they might have been getting too many...
Losing too many clients to this place.
It hasn't really impacted...
I mean, we still get women coming in here thinking they're going there.
So we... we attract them.
Now if they move somewhere else, yeah, we'd have to think about that because I think there's an important value in being as close as you can.
They did move from port Saint Louis up here.
And I was at both places.
Now I remember the time when they had the fence up in front of the place.
They put the fence up because we were talking to women, you know, and we were effective in taking them away.
But the fence went up and so we decided that...
Or I decided that I would talk to women over the fence by bringing a ladder and getting on top of the ladder and talking to them over the fence.
And so of course that generated a 911 call because I was now talking down to women.
Oh my...
Cop.
I don't know.
It's gonna be a hard one.
Very hard.
Anne: She's totally abortion-minded.
It's just like abortion logic, you know?
She has two other kids, da-da da-da.
I got to scan her today.
I don't wanna lose her.
If I make her come back, she might not.
Do you remember the one day
I was in the client...
In the counseling room with...
Like, six hours with that girl and jan was like, "so like now their new strategy is lock 'em in" till they decide to keep the baby?"
It's just like her.
Okay, Victoria, it does show positive, okay?
The nurse can scan you today.
- It wouldn't be right away.
- Okay.
I know you said you were hungry, okay?
I'm actually hungry too.
No no no, I'm gonna treat you.
Yeah. Just tell me.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Lunch is here.
Okay, um, let's see.
Ahem, how old is he?
- The same age.
- The same age?
Well, he's 23. I'm 24.
But he's not the best boyfriend, huh?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
He is verbally abusive and...
He's verbally abusive?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
For all you know, the baby changes him.
I have no idea. I don't know.
But you know, I mean, you're putting yourself through a surgery, through an emotional trauma in order to not be more tied to him or not to extend your relationship with him.
I mean, as a mom of two already,
I have to do what's best for me and my kids.
I've seen it so many times over that you think you're suffering's not gonna be too much.
I'm still waiting for a woman to sit where you're sitting and tell me,
"I'm not suffering from my abortion."
I'm not regretful.
I'm not depressed.
"I'm glad I did it."
I know for a fact that I won't regret it.
I don't know for a fact that I won't be depressed.
Maybe I will.
I don't know for a fact that...
That I won't stress about it.
Looking at the pictures stress me out.
I'm... I'm like, you know, all like...
You know, that's... that's bad.
It kind of...
You know, it hurts me.
But that's what abortions are for.
Abortions are to terminate unwanted pregnancies.
This pregnancy is unwanted.
I will have no regrets at all.
The only regrets that I have is sleeping with him...
Sleeping with him without a condom that one time.
You know, that's all it takes is one time.
- That's what I regret.
- That's all it takes is one time, but condoms...
- That's what I regret.
- Reality check here...
Condoms are only effective
85% of the time, okay?
- So even using a condom...
- Yeah.
Doesn't save you.
- Yeah, but 99.9%...
- No, 85%.
- Condoms are 85%?
- Are 85% effectiveness.
Okay, well, all the times
I used condoms,
I never got pregnant.
The times that
I haven't used condoms, that's when I get pregnant.
That's what I'm gonna base this off.
If I'd used a condom,
I wouldn't be pregnant.
- I'm gonna step outside and make a phone call.
- Oh, sure. Go ahead.
It'll just be a couple of minutes
- on the ultrasound anyway.
- Okay.
Man, this bitch is getting on my fucking nerve.
You know, if I have this baby, she's not gonna take care of it.
She's not gonna get up in the middle of the night, make a bottle for me.
She's not gonna be there.
Well, the thing is,
I don't... I don't care.
Like, don't try to talk me out of nothing.
I told her my mind is made up.
And in a few minutes I'm fixin' to get the ultrasound so I can get the hell up outta here.
- She's ready.
- Okay.
- Was the parking lot full when you came in?
- Yeah.
Or in the front wasn't...
In the front.
- Oh, I didn't know about the front.
- Oh, okay.
I was getting ready to go here, but I didn't see any...
Some days are, uh, busier than... than others.
- Is that it?
- Woman: Um...
There appears to be something there, but I can't confirm it yet.
Victoria: I'm sure she probably does that a lot because of the way she did it to me.
I mean, she offered to buy me food.
I found that crazy because, you know, I reached in my pocketbook.
I had my own money.
Maybe she thought because she bought me some McDonald's that was gonna change my mind, but...
They're some, like, anti-abortion...
I see a baby doll right there.
I don't know.
I feel like it's kind of crazy for them to just sit out of an abortion clinic.
I mean, the baby has nothing to do with them.
I don't know.
When your mind is made up, though, it can't be stopped.
- Woman: Are you the one with the sign?
- Yeah.
I just have a few questions about it.
- Why are you parked in there?
- Why am I parking there?
- This is an abortion clinic.
- I understand what it is.
- Okay.
- I had to park somewhere to talk to you.
- So park over there.
- Well, I'm already parked.
- Okay.
- That's not what I'm worried about.
I just would... I wanna understand why you guys use signs pointing to this building saying...
- Because they perform abortions here.
- "Baby killers"?
Okay...
Number one, the Bible says not to judge.
What is that doing?
- The Bible also...
- Pointing the finger.
- There's a difference. You're misinterpreting it.
- No no no.
- Yeah, you are.
- How about the sign you guys hold out here
- in front of the school for these little children...
- Right.
With a baby torn apart?
Why are you shooting the messenger?
They're the ones performing abortions, not us.
- I'm not shooting the messenger.
- Yeah, you are.
I'm just trying to let you guys know...
- This place was here first.
- That this is not helping.
I just have to pass this every day
- and it just disgusts me because...
- it disgusts you?
How do you think god feels about it?
So how do you think god feels about it?
He's creating these children...
- when you're holding up signs...
- Please let me finish.
- God creates us in the womb, yes?
- Yes, he does.
They're being destroyed here.
They're being murdered.
Right, I understand that completely.
That takes "precedent" over everything.
- If you do not value life, then what do you value?
- Okay.
That takes precedence over everything.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.
Woman: Keep pointing the finger.
Go ahead.
Woman #2: We're not pointing fingers.
We wanna close this place down.
Tony, she's just giving her opinion.
Unfortunately, she's been manipulated by the enemy because if she knew better, she would not be parked there...
- no, she's being an overprotective mom.
- She's being a f...
Her son or daughter goes to this school.
You know?
Tony: When the owner of the abortion clinic goes to pick up the abortionist, he's covered with a sheet so that we cannot see who this person is.
His identity is hidden from us so we don't harm him.
Now what has come to light to me within the past month is I've discovered, thanks through god, that I know where the owner of the abortion clinic meets the abortionists.
I know where he picks them up and where he drops them off.
Right now what I wanna do is I wanna check the super Wal-Mart and see if one of the doctors is parked there...
If it's the doctor
I'd seen the last time, if that's his vehicle.
That's him.
It is the same guy. Okay.
'Cause I've watched him and this is the same plate.
That's him.
Little do they know little old me is following them.
This is the part of doing this that drive you crazy.
You just have to wait.
I've been talking to a few people, a very small circle of people, about this information and hoping that they have contacts with people that can take this information and... bring it to light, tell me who the names are, where they live, et cetera, et cetera.
And then...
And then I was thinking of doing... is making a fairly big billboard, probably like 4x4, with a picture of the abortionist and say "this doctor performs abortions."
I'm not worried about the risks.
I'm not worried about any of that.
I'm not concerned about that because this is worth it.
This is life and death we're dealing with here and these people just don't see it that way.
Somebody came up with the idea that it's a woman's right.
It's her body.
She can do what she wants.
Well, unfortunately, that is not true.
Ho-ho, yes!
He came in a different direction.
He just... the owner of the abortion clinic dropped him off.
Opens up the car, goes in.
It's as if nothing happened.
He's just living his life, walking through it...
La-di-da-da, as if nothing happened.
He's just going about his everyday life.
Has no effect on him.
He could be going home to spend the day with his family and that just totally sickens me to death.
He just performed abortions and then he's going home and being affectionate to his wife or his...
And his children.
That just tears me up.
Candace: We had a chiropractor across the street and he put his building up for sale.
The sign went up one day, it literally came down the next day... within 24 hours.
And it was them.
They are relentless.
They just...
They never stop.
I mean, they don't have a life.
Evidently, they don't have a life.
I mean, every once in a while we think about, oh, we can go do a protest on their corner of the street, but we don't have time.
We're too busy raising grandkids and kids and working and making a living and living our lives.
We're not obsessed with them, you know?
If they would just stay on their side of the street and do what they've got to do...
And whatever they do over there, I just...
Oh, and I think one of them just showed up.
Lots of times they leave signs that they bring with them.
And there's a... that one big bloody fetus sign that shows the head, the arms, the legs.
They say it's eight weeks and...
Which is a bunch of junk.
They left it out there by the telephone pole or the pole out there, and we grabbed it and brought it in.
We take them home and destroy them.
All right, first things first here.
Let's see, 46 years old.
I'm still older than you.
"Do you have any doubts about your decision today to terminate your pregnancy?"
"Very very small ones."
Explain that to me.
What kind of doubts are you having?
It's okay.
Just I have no children.
And, um, in my 30s
I got rheumatoid and they told me not to get pregnant.
Then I got divorced and I'm with a great guy, but only four months.
But I'm 46, and if I have this baby, I'll be 47.
When that baby's 20, I'll be 67.
Those are the reasons
I'm doing this...
- Simply age.
- Age?
I don't know if I'll be physically able in my 50s to handle a toddler.
I wanna do it now before the child gets older in my womb.
Okay. Okay.
Well, as long as you're okay with everything, everything else will be okay.
We just wanna make sure that...
That this is definitely what you need to do, not want to do.
Nobody ever wants to do this, okay?
Nobody ever wants to do this.
But if it's what you need to do...
And it's your decision only.
- Nobody's forcing you to do this?
- No.
I take the responsibility to heart.
I can see you're a very serious person.
Okay.
Woman: Call upon your god.
Call upon your god.
Woman: Arnold, this is somebody's grandchildren here.
Somebody's grandchildren.
I would be ashamed too if I were you.
I would be ashamed.
I pick up the doctors because I do protect them.
The sheet is to cover them up so they won't know who they are, so they won't recognize them.
And then they go to their houses and they protest over there.
So we don't want them to do that.
I do worry about Candace.
When she's out there by herself, you know,
I tell her all the time to come back home before it gets dark.
"Shot in the back three times at close range" as he arrived to perform abortions.
"Police say Griffin has admitted the slaying."
Hmm.
"Second doctor's death closes clinic."
Yeah, they got a replacement and that doctor was killed too.
Thank god none of my doctors got killed.
Thank god.
The physicians that I know are very cautious about where they park their cars, who...
They have guns.
They carry weapons.
They wear bulletproof vests.
You try to protect them, but there's only so much you can do.
There's only so much you can do.
And then if they quit or get killed, where's the next doctor coming from?
He did move that camera closer to the building.
That's the alley, so we can see them when they're trying to get on our property, get too close to the building.
October 8th of 2000...
We had a fire that started in this room that was undetermined, but they thought the fax machine kind of started it.
But they pulled the plug out from the wall and there was nothing wrong with the plug.
So it didn't start with the fax machine.
I suspect foul play, that someone...
It was arson.
I do.
But I'm not a fire marshal.
I'm not an expert on fire or arson or anything.
I know nothing about it.
But I just know that was an awful year and we were closed for six months and it...
We almost lost everything.
No, it looks pretty quiet.
Did you hear about yesterday?
Yeah. So that's why
I do think they are killing.
I just don't know when.
Man: All right, ladies.
The abortionist is here.
You still have time.
It's not too late.
You still have time not to go through this procedure that you're gonna regret for the rest of your life.
Man: Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen.
Man: When I say love, you say babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
Unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
O clement, o loving, o sweet virgin Mary.
♪ Hey hey, you you, we don't like abortion ♪
♪ No way, no way, got to save the babies. ♪
For the past 14 years, we pro-lifers have had it easy.
That's all changed.
Elections do have consequences.
Man: What god has promised to all... the right to life...
No man, including president Barack
Obama, can take away.
- Get ready to say yes to life.
- Crowd: Yes!
We may have lost an election, we have not lost the war.
Man #2: You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you!
Anne: It's a right to free speech.
I mean, I just got back from Washington where there was a block full of these signs in front of the white house.
It would strike me as very curious, you know, that there would be a city of fort Pierce ordinance that can overrule the constitution.
Yeah.
There is a thing that says
"obscene pictures."
- I don't see anything obscene, so I'm not worried about it.
- Okay.
The major point here is we need to make sure you stay off of their property.
Oh yeah, nobody's interested in that.
Nobody has any interest in being on their property.
- You're staying or you're going?
- I'm staying.
Okay.
Do you recognize anybody out there?
The only one
I recognize is Cheryl, the one with the life mobile Van.
- Oh, that.
- She's across the street though, talking to somebody.
I'm surprised James ain't out there.
But I don't recognize all the older people.
- There's someone out there with a Walker.
- A Walker?
She's sitting on it.
That's ridiculous.
Candace: Started this a long time ago...
All the little brochures that they hand out on the sidewalk that we have kept or...
Just collected over the years.
"Complications of abortion."
Possible immediate complications:
Excessive bleeding, possibly causing removal of the uterus
"and a resulting inability to have children."
Oh, what language.
Breast cancer.
There's been so many studies done on the breast cancer thing and they all deny that.
And one... and one of the physicians that I've worked with for many many years says that if that's true, everybody who has a miscarriage would get breast cancer, and that's just not true.
I... I don't know where they get their medical information from, but I know that's totally wrong.
I've had patients who have booked an appointment.
I've given them directions on how to get here and they get confused because on the other side of Delaware and south 12th street is that pregnancy care center...
That sounds so nice.
The patients get confused and go to the wrong building.
It's like two hours later and the girl will ask,
"well, when am I getting my abortion?"
"Oh, we don't do abortions here."
That's when the patient figures out that she's in the wrong place.
- Stop.
- Why?
♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪
♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪
- ♪ Nervous nervous nervous. ♪
- Shut up.
That's your name for the day...
Nervous, miss nervous.
What do you think is the motivating factor for...
- Me to get this?
- Yeah.
My future and...
I can't take care of a baby right now.
I'm only in 11th grade.
I'm 17. I turn 18 in December.
I can't take on the responsibility of a baby by myself.
I just can't do it right now.
Do you really know what you choose when you choose abortion?
You will be given an anesthetic...
Two needles... into the cervix.
The doctor would use the force of the suction to essentially tear it apart... all the limbs.
The head would be crushed and the doctor would be using it to pull out the baby basically piece by piece.
And then it winds up, in the end, in a little jar.
You can't just walk around with, you know, pieces of the decaying fetus inside your body without developing an infection.
If a toe or a finger or a piece of the baby is left inside, then that produces a risk for you.
Narrator: In some cases, the patient will experience bleeding that is heavy enough to require a transfusion or hysterectomy.
In the most serious of these instances, she will die.
Can you cut it off?
I can't see it.
- Anne: You don't wanna see it?
- No.
Wanna go with the computer animated?
There's no blood. It's not real bodies.
It's computer.
- That was a real one?
- That's real.
- Kind of scary.
- Yeah.
I hate my life.
Yes yes!
Yes! Two in one day.
Ashante is keeping her baby.
We thought this one was Gonzo.
- Woman: Priggins?
- Priggins.
I couldn't freakin' believe it.
She got up to the point...
She made an appointment in Fort Lauderdale.
Never went. Never went!
Widline: I'm seven months pregnant now.
I didn't want no child at this age right now because people will look down at me and say I won't be nothing.
I tried everything in my powers to get rid of it, like drinking vinegar and, like, lifting heavy stuff up and moving heavy stuff around.
Anne told me about abortion.
A woman... she can, like, lose her life over abortion or don't have kids at all no more in the future.
So, um, I didn't wanna take that risk.
I don't think he's gonna, like...
It's gonna be harder with the baby.
I think I'm gonna get a lot of help.
I hope so.
Is this the abortion clinic?
Candace: Yes, it is, hon.
Come on in.
- Across the street?
- Yes.
And she made me watch this video of a surgical abortion.
It was very vivid and showed everything.
It was gruesome.
It was like watching a scary movie.
Just like...
There was so much blood and all these...
It was just disgusting.
There's not blood all over the surgery room, sweetie-pie.
I promise you.
Abortion is one of the safest procedures.
It is safer than having full-term delivery.
It's safer than having your tonsils out.
There's not blood all over the place.
I promise you.
You did an ultrasound already?
Yes, I took one across the street.
- And how far along did they say you were?
- I just went Wednesday.
They told me I was seven weeks, two days.
- This past Wednesday?
- Yeah.
- Seven weeks, two days?
- Yes. And two weeks before that, they told me I was five and a half weeks.
When was your last period... first day?
- August 13th.
- I think that would...
- Okay, August. And it's October, right?
- Yes.
That would make you, according to this,
10 weeks and one day.
Between 10 and 11.
Well, we'll find out, okay?
See, because...
No way.
On a chart that I have, 3.5...
That would be considered 10 weeks.
- 10 weeks?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, they told me I was seven weeks, two days.
Okay, so you're only gonna pay $400 total.
I'm gonna take $50 off to have it done.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Good? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Okay, baby. Okay.
- Okay.
I'll see you next Friday at 9:30, honey.
Okay? All right.
Man: No, these are not my words.
These are the words of...
Candace:
The pregnancy care center that's across the street from us...
They told her she was seven weeks.
They lie to patients about how many weeks they are so they think they have plenty of time to think about it a little bit longer.
I don't even think it's to get them to change their mind.
I think it's to have them be too far so they can't get it done.
That's what I think.
Or have to go to another state, another county, because clinics usually go up to, like, 12, 14 weeks, and that's it.
I... I don't get them people.
I just don't get them people.
It makes me wanna...
Makes me wanna cry.
Don't even...
I don't even know why, but I do...
I wanna cry today, because that's...
I just wanna go over there and shake them people and be all like,
"what the fuck are you doing?"
Why are you messing up these girls' lives?
"Why are you playing around with them like that?"
Oh.
Anne: Ooh.
No.
Arnold.
Arnold.
Arnold, brother, let's speak.
Come talk to me.
I haven't talked to you for a while.
Let's talk.
Euteneuer: Of the father, of the son and of the holy spirit, amen.
We offer this rosary for all of our regular pro-life intentions, especially the end to the evil of abortion, the conversion of all abortionists, to the conversion of those who come to this place, those who work at this place, those who support this work.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
- Amen.
- Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
- Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now...
And at the hour of our death, amen.
- Holy Mary...
- Pray for us.
- Holy mother of god...
- Pray for us.
- Holy virgin of virgins...
- Pray for us.

You know what? No more sex.
He can't have any unless he wears a condom.
- Are you married to him? He's your husband, right?
- Yeah.
You got to fight it.
That means take birth control pills,
- use condoms...
- But you know...
He's got to use condoms.
No, you're not stupid.
You just got to be more careful.
They don't care.
They're like...
They're like dogs.
They're like dogs.
- Yeah, I swear.
- Yeah.
How old are your babies?
You're not a mon...
You would be a monster if you...
If you had a baby and then mistreated it.
Oh...
Don't cry, sweetie-pie.
Don't cry.
Now are you like this because you're pregnant?
A lot of girls get kind of like this because they're pregnant.
They have hormones and it just goes zzz.
You never wanted to do this?
What's hurting you?
To have the abortion?
So why are you making yourself do this?
You are young.
You can have babies later on.
You really can. If you can't...
I don't want you to do this if you don't want to do it.
I mean, nobody ever wants to actually do it.
But, you know, if it's what you need to do to take care of you and the kids...
If you feel that way, why are you making yourself do it?
Mm-hmm.
Good afternoon.
A woman's world medical center.
How can I help you?
Tomorrow morning you'd have to be here at 6:30 in the morning, okay?
We do want you to bring your photo I.D. With you, a pair of socks, and we don't want you to eat anything after midnight tonight.
And when you get here in the morning, there may or may not be protesters outside.
If they are out there, just ignore them.
Come inside.
Yeah, if you needed to, we could send the lab tech out to walk up with you if you felt more comfortable.
Are you the father of this baby?
Don't give up your rights.
It's not a dead baby yet.
You come out, you're gonna be the mother of a dead baby and the whole family tree line is kaput.
Woman: These are the facts.
I know women that have had abortions and were never able to have a baby again.
And the only baby that they had is a dead one.
She is... she is thinking about it, but she wants help, money help.
I'll do it today. Whatever.
- Today.
- Whatever you need...
Whatever you need...
I will go to the bank today.
Whatever you need,
I'll help you.
Even if you have babies,
I'll give them clothes.
I'll give you money to help you with your rent, your gas, whatever you need, ma'am.
Whatever you need.
I'm not lying.
I tell you the truth.
Please.
I let you talk to the family.
Tell her I'll let her talk to the family.
Woman: Right now.
Hola. I'm Jim.
Everything's free.
Everything's free. Come on in.
Come on in with... okay.
Jim: Yeah, she did great, didn't she?
Oh my god.
Oh, thank you, lord.
Candace: If they really did change her mind, that's fine.
I just don't know who they think they are to try and control somebody they don't even know.
They talk that person into having another baby and they promise her everything in the world to get her to keep it, and then they don't deliver.
I've heard that story over and over again.
Jim: You think you're crying now?
I'm telling you, we see these women come in here, cry cry cry.
They can't stop because they think, "what did I do?"
What did I do?"
And you're a nice person.
We can tell.
You know, you would never hurt anybody.
You love children, right?
You have six children.
Okay?
I wanna give... come here,
I wanna give you a present.
Come here.
Let's pick out something nice for...
What kind of stuff do you think is cute?
What do you like?
Do you like little stuffed animals?
You wanna take a stuffed animal?
We got so many of these.
Which one do you want?
Pick out something you like.
Yeah, we'll hook you up.
There was me.
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...
... what to do with the evening.
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...
... which is what we were drinking.
This would sharpen you up...
... and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.
In Dublin 's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes
On sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels..."
One thing I could never stand...
... was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...
... howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...
... and going "blerp blerp"
in between...
... as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.
Not in a stinking world like this.
And what's so stinking about it?
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order anymore!
It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old...
...like you done!
It's no world for an old man any longer.
What kind of a world is it at all?
Men on the moon.
Men spinning around the earth.
And there's not no attention paid...
...to earthly law and order no more.
Oh, dear land
I fought for thee
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...
... and his four droogs.
They were about to perform
a little of the old...
... in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...
...billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.
How are thou...
...thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?
Come and get one in the yarbles...
...if you have any yarbles...
...you eunuch jelly, thou.
Let's get them, boys!
The police!
Come on. Let's go!
The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...
... with real country dark.
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night...
... playing Hogs of the Road.
Then we headed west.
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.
That was a real kick...
... and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.
Who on earth could that be?
I'll go and see.
Yes, who is it?
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.
But, missus, it's a matter of life and death!
Who is it, dear?
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.
He wants to use the telephone.
I suppose you better let him in.
Wait a minute, will you?
I'm sorry, but we don't usually let strangers in...
What do you want from me?
Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim...
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun 's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And I'm singing
Just singing...
... in the rain
Viddy well, little brother.
Viddy well.
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...
... it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.
Hello, Lucy.
Had a busy night?
We've been working hard too.
Pardon me, Luce.
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...
... laughing and govoreeting.
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...
... she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...
... some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...
... standing endwise.
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...
... and then down again.
Because I knew what she sang.
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners.
Without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public-wise.
I don't like you should do what you done.
And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that.
Do watch that, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles!
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!
I'll meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime.
I'm not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless.
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.
A nozh scrap anytime you say.
Doobidoob.
A bit tired maybe.
Best not to say more.
Bedways is rightways now.
So best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka.
Right, right?
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...
... in municipal flat block
1 8- A, Linear North.
It had been a wonderful evening.
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.
Oh, bliss!
Bliss and heaven!
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...
... gravity all nonsense now.
As I slooshied...
... I knew such lovely pictures.
Alex. Alex!
What do you want?
It's past eight, Alex.
You don't want to be late for school, son.
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.
Leave us be, and I'll try and sleep it off.
And then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
But you've not been to school all week, son.
Got to rest, Mum.
Got to get fit.
Otherwise, I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.
He's not feeling too good again this morning, Dad.
Yes. Yes, I heard.
You know what time he got in?
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.
I wonder...
...where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Like he says...
...it's mostly odd things he does.
Helping-like...
...here and there, as it might be.
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.
Funny surprise, seeing you here.
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?
I met your mother on the way to work, yes?
She gave me the key.
She said something about a pain somewhere.
Hence, not at school, yes?
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother sir.
It should be clear by this afterlunch.
Or certainly by this evening, yes.
The evening's the great time, isn't it, Alex-boy?
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.
Sit, sit, sit!
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?
Anything wrong, sir?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong?
Have you been doing something you shouldn't?
Just a manner of speech.
Yes, well, it's just a manner of speech from your...
...post-corrective advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex.
Because next time it's not going to be the corrective school.
Next time it'll be the Barley place, and all my work ruined.
If you've no respect for yourself...
...you at least might have some for me, who sweated over you.
A big, black mark, I tell you, for every one we don't reclaim.
A confession of failure for every one of you...
...who ends up in the stripy hole.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.
The millicents have nothing on me, brother.
Sir, I mean.
Cut out this clever talk about millicents.
Just because the police haven't picked you up...
...doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness.
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?
A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late.
Your name was mentioned.
The words got to me by the usual channels.
Certain friends of yours were named also.
Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual.
I'm warning you, little Alex...
...being a good friend to you as always...
...the one man in this sore and sick community...
...who wants to save you from yourself!
What gets into you all?
We've been studying the problem for damn well near a century.
But we get no farther with our studies.
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.
You've got not too bad of a brain.
Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Nobody's got anything on me.
I been out of the millicents' rookers for a long time.
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.
You're about due, by my reckoning.
That's why I'm warning you...
...to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt.
Do I make myself clear?
As an unmuddied lake, sir.
As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer.
You can rely on me, sir.
Excuse me, brother.
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?
Just a minute.
Pardon me, ladies.
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?
A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely?
What's happened to yours, my little sister?
Who you getting, bratty?
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?
The Heaven 17?
What you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on?
I bet you've got little pitiful, portable picnic players.
Come with Uncle and hear all proper.
Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones.
You are invited.
Hi, hi, hi, there.
Well, hello.
He are here!
He have arrived!
Hooray!
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well!
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
We got worried.
There we were, waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko...
...and you had not turned up.
And we thought you might have been, like...
...offended by something or other.
So around we come to your abode.
Appy polly loggies.
I had something of a pain in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.
I was not awakened when I gave orders for wakening.
Sorry about the pain.
Using the gulliver too much-like, maybe.
Giving orders and discipline and such, perhaps.
You sure the pain is gone?
You sure you'd not be happier back in bed?
Let's get things nice and sparkling clear.
This sarcasm, if I may call it such...
...does not become you, my little brothers.
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.
Now then, Dim.
What does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother.
That's part of the new way.
New way?
What's this about a new way?
There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, I know it.
If you must have it, have it, then.
We go around shop crasting and the like...
...coming out with a pitiful rookerfull of money each.
And Will the English in the coffee mesto...
...saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast.
The shiny stuff. The ice!
The big, big money's available, is what Will the English says.
And what will you do with the big, big, big money?
Have you not everything you need?
If you need a motorcar, you pluck it from the trees.
If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child.
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.
Good! Real horrorshow!
Initiative comes to thems that wait.
I've taught you much, my little droogies.
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...
... I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...
... saying what we should do
and what not to do.
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...
... and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.
There was a window open
with a stereo on...
... and I viddied right at once
what to do.
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...
... the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...
... down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.
Now they knew who was
master and leader.
Sheep, thought I.
But a real leader knows
always when, like...
... to give and show generous
to his unders.
Now we're back to where we were.
Yes?
Just like before, and all forgotten?
Right, right, right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
Well, Georgie-boy...
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.
Not tonight.
Not this nochy.
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.
You're a big, strong chelloveck, like us all.
We're not little children, are we, Georgie-boy?
What, then, didst thou in thy mind have?
It's this health farm.
A bit out of the town.
Isolated.
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver...
... and, like, jewels.
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.
Oh, shit!
Who's there?
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!
Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry.
There's a telephone in the public house a mile down the road.
I suggest you use that.
But missus, this is an emergency!
It's a matter of life and death!
Me friend's lying in the middle of the road, bleeding to death!
I'm very sorry, but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Very well, madam.
You can't be blamed for being suspicious...
...with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about.
I'll try and get help at the pub, then.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Dim, bend down.
I'll get in that window and open the front door.
Radlett Police Station?
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers at Woodmere Health Farm.
I'm sorry to bother you, but something rather odd just happened.
It's probably nothing at all, but you never know.
A young man rang the bell, asking to use the telephone.
He said there's been some kind of accident.
The thing that caught my attention was what he said.
His words sounded like those quoted in the papers this morning...
...in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted.
Just a few minutes ago.
If you think that's necessary.
But I'm quite sure he's gone away now.
All right, fine.
Thank you very much.
Hi, hi, hi, there.
At last we meet.
Our brief govorett through the letter-hole was not satisfactory.
Who are you?
How the hell did you get in here?
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
Naughty, naughty, naughty!
You filthy old soomaka.
Now listen here, you little bastard!
Just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in.
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!
It's a very important work of art.
What the bloody hell do you want?
To be perfectly honest, madam...
...I'm taking part in an international students' contest...
...to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Cut the shit, sonny...
...and get out of here before you get yourself into serious trouble.
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...
...before I throw you out!
Wretched, slummy bedbug!
I'll teach you to break into real people's houses.
Fucking...
...little...
...bastard!
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.
You bastards! I'm blind!
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!
It's no good sitting there in hope, my little brothers.
I won't say a single solitary slovo unless I have my lawyer here.
I know the law, you bastards.
Righty-right, Tom.
We'll have to show our friend Alex here that we know the law too.
But that knowing the law isn't everything.
Nasty cut you've got there, little Alex.
Shame, isn't it?
Spoils all your beauty.
Who gave you that, then?
How'd you do that, then?
What's your point, you bastard?
That is for your lady victim.
You ghastly...
...wretched scoundrel.
Get him off me!
You rotten little bastard!
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.
Good evening, Sergeant.
They're in room B, sir.
Thank you very much.
Sergeant...
Good evening.
Good evening, Inspector.
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.
May I have some paper towels, please?
We're interrogating the prisoner now.
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.
Oh, dear! This boy does look a mess, doesn't he?
Just look at the state of him.
Love's young nightmare-like.
Violence makes violence.
He resisted his lawful arrestors.
This is the end of the line for me.
The end of the line, yes.
And what of me, brother sir?
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.
I was led on by the treachery of others.
Sings the roof off lovely, he does, sir.
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!
It was all their idea, brothers.
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!
You are now a murderer, little Alex.
A murderer.
Not true, sir.
It was only a slight tolchok.
She were breathing, I swear it.
I've just come from the hospital.
Your victim has died.
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.
This is some new form of torture.
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.
If you'd care to give him a bash in the chops, don't mind us.
We'll hold him down.
He must be a great disappointment to you, sir.
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...
... O my brothers and only friends.
After a trial,
with judges and a jury...
... and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...
... he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84- F...
... among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...
... against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...
... at her only child
and son of her bosom...
... like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.
Right! Open up the cell!
Yes, sir.
Here are the prisoner's committal forms.
Thank you, mister.
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.
From this moment, you will address all prison officers as "sir."
Name?
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
Sentence?
14 years, sir.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.
You are now 655321.
It is your duty to memorize that number.
Thank you, mister. Well done.
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.
All right, empty your pockets.
Are you able to see the white line painted on the floor...
...directly behind you...
Then your toes belong...
...on the other side of it!
- Yes, sir.
- Right.
Carry on.
Pick that up...
...and put it down properly.
One half-bar of chocolate.
One bunch of keys on white metal ring.
One packet of cigarettes.
Two plastic ball pens.
One black, one red.
One pocket comb, black plastic.
One address book, imitation red leather.
One ten-penny piece.
One white metal wristlet watch...
...Timawrist, on a white metal expanding bracelet.
Anything else in your pockets?
- No, sir.
- Right.
Sign here for your valuable property.
The tobacco and chocolate you brought in...
...you lose that...
...as you are now convicted.
Now over to the table and get undressed.
Were you in police custody this morning?
One jacket, blue pinstriped.
Prison custody?
Yes, sir, on remand.
- One necktie, blue.
- Religion?
C. Of E., sir.
Do you mean the Church of England?
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.
Brown hair, isn't it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue, sir.
Do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or any false limbs?
One pair of trousers, blue pinstriped.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
One pair of socks, black.
Are you an epileptic?
One pair of underpants, white with blue waistband.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a homosexual?
Right.
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.
Now then, face the wall...
...bend over and touch your toes.
Any venereal disease?
Crabs? Lice?
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.
What's it going to be, eh?
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this...
...though more in than out for most of you?
Or are you going to attend to the divine word...
...and realize the punishments that await unrepentant sinners...
...in the next world as well as this?
A lot of idiots you are...
...selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge.
The thrill of theft.
Of violence.
The urge to live easy.
Well, I ask you what is it worth...
...when we have undeniable proof...
...yes, incontrovertible evidence...
...that hell exists?
I know!
I know, my friends.
I have been informed...
...in visions...
...that there is a place...
...darker than any prison...
...hotter than any flame of human fire...
...where souls...
...of unrepentant criminal sinners like yourselves...
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.
I say, like yourselves...
...scream...
...in endless and unendurable agony.
Their skin...
...rotting and peeling.
A fireball...
...spinning in their screaming guts!
I know. Yes, I know!
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...
...in the prisoner's hymnal.
And let's have a little reverence, you bastards!
I was a wandering sheep
- Sing up, damn you!
- I did not love the fold
Louder!
I did not love my shepherd's voice
I would not be controlled
Louder!
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...
... and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...
... ready to dribble all over...
... a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.
It was my rabbit...
... to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...
... and also now very interested
in the Big Book.
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.
And I could viddy myself
helping in...
... and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.
I didn 't so much like
the latter part of the Book...
... which is more like
all preachy talking...
... than fighting
and the old in-out.
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...
... and then drink
their Hebrew vino...
... and getting onto the bed
with their wives ' handmaidens.
That kept me going.
"Seek not to be like evil men.
Neither desire to be with them...
...because their minds studieth robberies...
...and their lips speak deceits."
If thou lose hope, being weary in the days of distress...
...thy strength shall be diminished.
Fine, my son. Fine.
Father?
I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.
I've never been guilty of any institutional infraction, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.
And you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father...
...can I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son. Certainly.
Is there something troubling you, my son?
Don't be shy to speak up.
Remember...
...I know of the...
...urges that can trouble young men...
...deprived...
...of the society of women.
It's nothing like that, Father.
It's about this new thing they're all talking about.
About this new treatment.
It gets you out of prison in no time.
And makes sure you never get back in again.
Where did you hear about this?
Who's been talking about these things?
These things get around.
Two warders talk, as it might be.
And somebody can't help overhearing what they say.
Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops...
...and the newspaper tells all about it.
How about putting me in for this new treatment?
I take it you are referring...
...to the Ludovico technique.
I don't know what it's called.
I just know it gets you out quickly...
...and makes sure you never get back in again.
That is not proven, 655321.
In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has been used, hasn't it?
It has not been used in this prison yet.
The governor has grave doubts about it.
And I've heard there are very serious dangers involved.
I don't care about the dangers.
I just want to be good.
I want for the rest of my life to be...
...one act of goodness.
The question is...
...whether or not this technique really makes a man good.
Goodness comes from within.
Goodness...
...is chosen.
When a man cannot choose...
...he ceases to be a man.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father.
I only know I want to be good.
Be patient, my son.
Put your trust in the Lord.
Instruct Thy Son and He shall refresh thee...
...and shall give delight to thy soul.
Amen.
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!
Right!
All present and correct, sir!
Prisoners, halt!
Now pay attention!
I want you in two lines...
...up against that wall, facing this way.
Go on, move!
Hurry up!
Stop talking!
Prisoners ready for inspection, sir!
How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get?
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. We need larger prisons, more money.
Not a chance, my dear fellow.
The government can't be concerned any longer...
...with outmoded penalogical theories.
Soon we may need all prison space for political offenders.
Common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis.
Kill the criminal reflex, that's all.
Full implementation in a year's time.
Punishment means nothing to them.
They enjoy their so-called punishment.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Shut your bleeding hole!
Who said that?
I did, sir.
Wer...
- ...are you?
- We are three wise men.
- What?
- We are three wise men.
What are you doing creeping around a cowshed at 2:00 a.m.?
That doesn't sound very wise to me.
- We are astrologers.
- We have come from the East.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- We wish to praise the infant.
- We must pay a homage to him.
- Homage? You're all drunk!
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!
Bursting in here with tales about
Oriental fortunetellers. Out!
- No, no, we must see him.
- Go and praise someone else's brat!
- We were led by a star!
- Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!
- We must see him. We have presents!
- Out!
Gold, frankincense, myrrh!
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
Well, what is myrrh anyway?
- It is a valuable balm.
- A balm?!
What are you giving him a balm for?
It might bite him!
- What?
- That's a dangerous animal!
- Throw it in the trough!
- No, it isn't!
- It's a great big...
- No, no, no, it is an ointment.
Well, there is an animal called a balm, or did I dream it?
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he then?
What star-sign is he?
- Capricorn.
- Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
Well, he's the Son of God.
Our Messiah.
King of the Jews!
- And that's Capricorn, is it?
- No, no, no, that's just him!
I was gonna say, otherwise there'd be a lot of them.
- By what name are you calling him?
- Brian.
We worship you, Brian, who are lord over us all.
Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
- Do you do a lot of this?
- What?
- This praising.
- No, no. No, no.
Well, if you're dropping by again, do pop in.
And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense...
...but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
Thank you. Goodbye.
Well, weren't they nice?
Out of their bloody minds, but still, look at that!
Here. Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!
Shut up!
Brian
The babe they called Brian
He grew
Grew, grew and grew
Grew up to be
Grew up to be
A boy called Brian
A boy called Brian
He had arms and legs
And hands and feet
This boy
Whose name was Brian
And he grew
Grew, grew and grew
Grew up to be
Yes, he grew up to be
A teenager called Brian
A teenager called Brian
And his face became spotty
Yes, his face became spotty
And his voice dropped down low
And things started to grow
On young Brian and show
He was certainly no
No girl named Brian
Not a girl named Brian
And he started to shave
And have one off the wrist
And want to see girls
And go out and get pissed
A man called Brian
This man called Brian
The man they called Brian
This man called
Brian
How blessed are those who know that he's of God.
How blessed are the sorrowful.
They shall find consolation.
How blessed are those of gentle spirit.
They shall have the earth for their possession.
How blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail.
They shall be satisfied.
How blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
They shall see God.
- Speak up!
- Quiet, mum!
Well, I can't hear a thing.
Let's go to a stoning.
- You can go to a stoning anytime.
- Come on, Brian.
Will you be quiet?
Don't pick your nose!
I wasn't. I was scratching.
You was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
- I wasn't!
- Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
- Do you mind? I can't hear a word.
- Don't you "do you mind" me.
- I was talking to my husband.
- Talk to him somewhere else.
- I can't hear a bloody thing.
- Don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear, big nose.
Don't you call my husband "big nose."
- Well, he has got a big nose.
- Could you be quiet, please?
- What was that?
- I was too busy talking to big nose.
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."
What's so special about the cheese makers?
It's not meant to be taken literally.
It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
If you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, big nose.
Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in!
Listen, might be a bit about "Blessed are the big noses."
Lay off him.
You're not so bad yourself, conk-face.
Where are you two from? Nose City?
One more time,
I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!
Language!
And don't pick your nose!
I wasn't going to.
I was gonna thump him!
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.
- The Greek?
- Apparently, he's gonna inherit the earth.
- Did anyone catch his name?
- You won't thump anybody.
- I'll thump him if he calls me "big nose"!
- Shut up, big nose!
Right. I warned you.
I really will slug you so hard...!
It's the meek.
"Blessed are the meek."
That's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they getting something. They have a hell of a time.
Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose.
Your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished!
Who hit yours? Goliath's big brother?
- Right, that's your last warning.
- Do pipe down.
Silly bitch, getting in the way.
Break it up!
- Come on, let's go to the stoning.
- All right.
Blessed is just about everyone with an interest in the status quo, right, Reg?
What Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Come on, Brian, or they'll have stoned him before we get there.
All right.
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting.
Officer, intervene here.
Attempted rape going on. It's the chap with the big nose's fault. He started it all.
I hate wearing these beards.
- Why aren't women allowed at stonings?
- It's written, that's why.
- Beard, madam?
- I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
He's not well again.
- Stone, sir?
- They've got them lying on the ground.
Not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship.
All right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
Could I have a flat one, Mum?
Sorry. Dad.
All right. Two points, two flats and a packet of gravel.
Packet of gravel.
Should be a good one this afternoon.
- Local boy.
- Oh, good.
Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...
- Do I say yes?
- Yes!
...you have been found guilty by the elders of the town...
...of uttering the name of our Lord...
...and so as a blasphemer...
...you are to be stoned to death!
Look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was:
"That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
Blasphemy! He said it again!
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah! Yes, we did!
Really.
Are there any women here today?
Very well. By virtue of the authority...
...vested in me...
Lay off! We haven't started yet.
Come on! Who threw that?
Who threw that stone? Come on!
She did! She did!
He did! He did! He did!
Sorry, I thought we'd started.
- Go to the back.
- Oh, dear.
Always one, isn't there?
- Now, where were we?
- I don't think it ought to be blasphemy...
...just saying "Jehovah."
- He did! He did!
You're only making it worse for yourself!
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more...
Right! Who threw that?
Come on! Who threw that?
Him! Him! Him!
- Was it you?
- Yes.
- Right...
- Well, you did say Jehovah.
Stop. Stop. Will you stop that?
Stop it!
Now, look. No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle.
Do you understand?
Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear...
...even if they do say Jehovah.
Good shot!
- Have I got a big nose, mum?
- Stop thinking about sex.
- I wasn't.
- You're always on about it.
Morning, noon and night.
"Will the girls like this, will the girls like that?
Is it too big, is it too small?"
- Alms for a leper.
- Alms for a leper.
Alms for an ex-leper.
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same, ain't they? Never have any change.
Here's a touch.
- Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
- Buzz off.
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
A talent? That's more than he earns in a month.
- Half a talent then?
- No, go away.
- Big nose, let's haggle.
- What?
All right, let's say you open at one shekel, I start at 2000, we close at 1800.
- No.
- Go away!
- Leave him alone.
- All right. Two shekels, just two.
- Is this fun, eh?
- Look, he's not giving you any money.
Now piss off!
All right, final offer, half a shekel for an ex-leper?
- Did you say ex-leper?
- That's right, sir.
Sixteen years behind a bell and proud of it.
- Well, what happened?
- I was cured, sir.
- Cured?
- A bloody miracle, sir. God bless you.
- Who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.
One minute I'm a leper with a trade, next minute my livelihood's gone.
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.
Well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that sir.
I could, I suppose.
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the week.
You know, something beggable, but not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.
Brian. Come and clean your room out.
- There you are.
- Thank you. Thank...
- Half a dinare for me bloody life story?
- There's no pleasing some people.
That's just what Jesus said, sir.
Good afternoon.
Hello, officer.
I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
What's he doing here?
- Don't start, Brian. Go clean your room.
- Bloody Romans.
Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have all this.
- And don't you forget it.
- We don't owe the Romans anything.
That's not entirely true, is it, Brian?
What do you mean?
Well, you know when you were asking me about your?
- My nose?
- Yes, well, there's a reason it's like it is.
What is it?
Well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, but...
Well, Brian...
...your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
- I never thought he was.
Now, none of your cheek!
He was a Roman, Brian.
He was a centurion in the Roman army.
- You mean you were raped?!
- Well, at first, yes.
- Who was it?
- Naughtius Maximus his name was.
Promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, house by the Forum...
...slaves, asses' milk...
...as much gold as I could eat.
Then he, having his way with me he had:
Like a rat out of an aqueduct.
The bastard.
Yes, and next time you go on about the "bloody Romans"...
...don't forget you're one of them.
- I'm not a Roman, Mum.
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.
I'm kosher, Mum. I'm a Red Sea pedestrian and proud of it!
Sex, sex, sex, that's all they think about, huh?
Well, how are you then, officer?
Ladies and gentlemen, the next contest is between...
...Frank Goliath, the Macedonian baby-crusher...
...and Boris Mineburg.
Thank you, madam.
Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers.
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.
Wolf-nipple chips.
Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats...
I do feel, Reg, that any anti-imperialist group like ours...
...must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
- Agreed. Francis?
- Judith's point of view is very valid...
...provided the movement never forgets it is the unalienable right of every man...
- Or woman.
...or woman...
...to rid himself...
- Or herself.
- Agreed.
- Thanks, brother.
- Or sister.
- Or sister...
Where was I?
- I think you finished.
- Right.
- It is the birthright of every man...
- Or woman.
Shut up about women, Stan.
You're putting us off.
Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement.
Why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
What?
I want to be a woman.
From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.
- What?
- It's my right as a man.
Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
You want to have babies?!
It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?
Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies...
...not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans'...
...but he has the right to have babies.
- Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother. Sister.
- What's the point?
- What?
Why fight for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?
It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
Symbolic of his struggle against reality.
- Get out there. Get out.
- It's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.
- Got any nuts?
- Haven't got any nuts.
- I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens...
- No, no, no.
- Otters' noses?
- I don't want any Roman rubbish.
- Why don't you sell proper food?
- Proper food?
- Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
- Don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this.
- All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
- Make it two.
- Two.
- Thanks, Reg.
- Are you the Judean People's Front?
- Fuck off.
- What?
- Judean People's Front.
We're The People's Front of Judea.
- Judean People's Front, God!
- Wankers.
- Can I join your group?
- No, piss off.
I didn't want to sell this. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.
I hate the Romans already.
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ, you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do.
- Oh, yeah, how much?
- A lot.
Right, you're in. Listen...
...the only people we hate more than
Romans are the Judean People's Front.
- Splitters.
- And the Judean Popular People's Front.
- Oh, yeah.
- Splitters.
- And the People's Front of Judea.
- Yeah. Splitters.
- What?
- The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.
We're the People's Front of Judea.
- I thought we were the Popular Front.
- People's Front.
Whatever happened to the Popular Front, Reg?
He's over there.
Splitter!
I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
Absolutely dreadful.
- What's your name?
- Brian. Brian Cohen.
We may have a little job for you, Brian.
What's this then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?
"People called Romanes, they go the house"?
It says, "Romans go home."
No, it doesn't. What's Latin for Roman?
- Come on.
- Romanus?
- Goes like?
- Anus?
Vocative plural of anus is?
- Ani?
- Romani.
- "Eunt"? What is eunt?
- Go.
- Conjugate the verb "to go."
- Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.
So eunt is?
Third person plural, present indicative.
"They go."
But "Romans go home" is an order, so you must use the?
- Imperative!
- Which is?
- Oh, - i.
- How many Romans?
- Plural, plural. Ite. Ite.
- Ite.
Domus? Nominative?
"Go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, boy?
Dative! Not dative, not the dative, sir!
The accusative! Accusative!
Domum, sir. Ad domum.
- Except that domus takes the?
- The locative, sir.
- Which is?
- Domum!
Domum.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Write that 100 times.
- Yes, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar.
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
Finished.
Right. Now, don't do it again.
Hey. Bloody Romans.
We get in through the underground heating-system...
...up through into the main audience chamber here...
...and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
Having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate...
...that she is in our custody, and forthwith issue our demands.
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire Roman imperialist state...
...and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.
Send them back on the hour, every hour.
Show them we're not to be trifled with.
And of course, we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up...
...and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
No blackmail!
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.
And not just from us! From our fathers, and from our fathers' fathers.
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Yeah.
- And our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
- All right, don't labour the point.
And what have they ever given us in return?
The aqueduct?
- What?
- The aqueduct.
Yeah, they did give us that.
That's true, yeah.
And the sanitation.
Yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.
I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation, the two things the Romans have done.
- And the roads.
- Yeah, obviously the roads.
I mean the roads go without saying, don't they?
But apart from sanitation, aqueduct and roads...
- Irrigation.
- Medicine.
- Education.
- Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.
And the wine.
That's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
Public baths.
It's safe to walk in the streets at night now.
They know how to keep order.
Let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this.
All right, but apart from sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order...
...irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system and public health...
...what have the Romans ever done for us?
- Brought peace?
- Peace. Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bented.
- It's all right, Matthias.
- It's all clear.
Well, where's Reg?
Reg. Reg. It's Judith.
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.
- Did he finish the slogan?
- 100 times.
In letters 10 foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great.
Great. We need doers in our movement,
Brian, but before you join us, know this:
There is not one of us who would not gladly die...
...to rid this country of the Romans.
Well, one.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
From now on, you shall be called,
"Brian, that is called Brian."
Tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
Right. This is the plan:
Now, this is the palace
in Caesar's Square.
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street...
... and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the PFJ...
... will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head...
... though he will not be taking part in any
terrorist action, as he has a bad back.
- Aren't you gonna come with us?
- Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.
There is a Roman feast later,
so we must move fast...
... and don't wear your best sandals.
Turning left here, we enter
the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.
And from there proceed directly
to the hypocaust.
This has just been re-tiled.
So terrorists, careful with those weapons.
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.
This is the moment
for Habakkuk to get out his prong.
Campaign for Free Galilee.
People's Front of Judea. Officials.
- What's your group doing here?
- We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife.
- So are we.
- What?
That's our plan.
- We were here first.
- What do you mean?
- We thought of it first.
- Oh, yeah?
Yes, a couple of years ago.
- We did.
- You got all your demands worked out?
- Of course we have.
- What are they?
- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Pull the other one.
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.
- Did not.
- We did.
- You didn't.
- We bloody did!
Bastards, we've been planning this for months.
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.
- All right.
- Why you sly...
Brothers! Brothers!
We should be struggling together!
We are.
We mustn't fight each other!
Surely, we should be united against the common enemy!
The Judean People's Front?!
No, no, the Romans!
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's right.
- Look out!
Careful.
- Right! Where were we?
- You were gonna punch me.
Oh, yeah!
Brothers!
Get off!
- You lucky bastard.
- Who's that?
- You lucky, lucky bastard.
- What?
- Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
- What do you mean?
You must have slipped him a few shekels, eh?
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!
What wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face?
I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at in the face.
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!
Manacles!
My idea of heaven...
...is to be allowed to be put in manacles just for a few hours.
They must think the sun shines out of your arse, sonny.
Lay off me, I've had a hard time!
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years...
...they only hung me the right way up yesterday! So don't you come around...
All right, all right.
They must think you're Lord God almighty.
- What will they do to me?
- You'll probably get away with crucifixion.
- Crucifixion?!
- Yeah. First offence.
- Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
- Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.
If we didn't have crucifixion, this country would be a mess.
- Guard!
- Nail them up, I say!
- Guard!
- Nail some sense into them!
- What do you want?
- I want you to move me to another cell.
Oh, look at that! Bloody favouritism!
- Shut up, you.
- Sorry.
Now, take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.
Every night they take me down for 20 minutes...
...then they hang me up again.
Which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
And if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans...
...and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life...
...unless you are prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's...
Shut up!
- Pilate wants to see you!
- Me?
- Come on!
- Pilate? What does he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way you ought to be crucified.
- Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
- Shut up!
Right. Right.
Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail.
Only one survivor, sir.
Throw him to the floor.
- What, sir?
- Throw him to the floor.
Now, what is your name, Jew?
- Brian, sir.
- Brian, eh?
No, no, Brian.
The little rascal has spirit.
- Has what, sir?
- Spirit.
Yes, he did, sir.
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.
About 11, sir.
So...
- You dare to raid us?
- To what, sir?
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.
And throw him to the floor, sir?
- What?
- Throw him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.
Now, Jewish rapscallion...
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.
- A Roman?
- No, no, Roman.
So your father was a Roman?
Who was he?
He was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really?
- What was his name?
- Naughtius Maximus.
Centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
Well, no, sir.
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?
Well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.
Like "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?
Well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
You will find yourself in gladiator school very quickly...
...with rotten behaviour like that.
Can I go now, sir?
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
- Right! Take him away!
- Sir, he...
No, no, I want him fighting rabid wild animals within a week!
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends ridiculed by the common soldiery!
Anybody else feel like a little...
...giggle...
...when I mention my friend...
...Biggus...
...Dickus?
And what about you?
Do you find it risible...
...when I say the name...
...Biggus...
...Dickus?
He has a wife, you know.
You know what she's called?
She's called...
...Incontinentia.
Incontinentia Buttocks. Shut up!
What is all this?
I've had enough of this rowdy-rebel, sniggering behaviour!
Silence!
You call yourselves centurion guards?
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!
You lucky bastard.
And the beast's head shall be huge and black...
...and the eyes. They're of red, with the blood of living creatures!
And the whore of Babylon shall ride forth on a three-headed serpent...
...and throughout the land shall be a great rubbing of parts.
And the demon shall bear a nine-bladed sword!
Nine-bladed! Not two or five or seven, but nine!
Which he will wield on all wretched sinners. Sinners just like you, sir, there.
- And the horns shall be on the head...
- Through Hebediah, his servant...
...there shall in that time be rumours of things going astray...
...and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
And nobody will really know where lieth those little things...
...with the sort of raffia-work base, that has an attachment.
At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer...
...and the young shall not know where lieth...
...the things possessed by their fathers...
...that their fathers put there only just the night before, about 8:00.
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...
...that in that time shall the turds...
- How much? Quickly.
- What?
- It's for the wife.
- Twenty shekels.
- Right.
- What?
- There you are.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
- Well, we're supposed to haggle.
- No, I've got to...
- What do you mean, "No"?
- I haven't got time...
- Give it back.
- No, no, no, I just paid you.
- Burt.
- Yeah?
- This bloke won't haggle.
- Won't haggle?!
- All right, do we have to?
- Now look, I want 20 for that.
- I just gave you 20.
- Are you telling me that's not worth 20?
- No.
Look. Feel the quality, that's none of your goat.
- All right, I'll give you 19.
- No, come on, do it properly.
- What?
- Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.
- Well, you just said it was worth 20.
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Come on, haggle.
- All right, I'll give you 10.
That's more like it.
Ten? Are you trying to insult me?
Me, with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
- All right, I'll give you 11.
- Now you're getting it. 11?!
Did I hear you right? 11?
- This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
- Seventeen?
- No, no, no, no, "17"!
- Eighteen?
- No, no, you go to 14 now.
- All right, I'll give you 14.
- Fourteen!? Are you joking?
- That's what you told me to say!
- Oh, dear.
- Tell me what to say, please!
- Offer me 14.
- I'll give you 14.
- He's offering me 14 for this!
- Fifteen!
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
- Sixteen.
- Done.
Nice to do business with you.
- I'll throw you in this as well.
- I don't want it.
- Burt.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
I just gave you 20.
- That's right, that's four I owe you.
- No, that's all right.
- No, I've got it here.
- It's all right, that's four for the gourd.
Four? For this gourd? Four!?
It's worth 10 if it's worth a shekel!
- You just gave it to me for nothing.
- Yes, but it's worth 10.
All right, all right.
No, no, no, no, it's not worth 10, you're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"
Oh, well. One born every minute.
- Daniel.
- Daniel.
- Job.
- Job.
- Job.
- Joshua.
- Joshua.
- Joshua.
- Judges.
- Judges.
- Judges.
- And Brian.
- And Brian.
- And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these ex-brothers...
...be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
- I second that, Reg.
- Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
Siblings, let us not be down on it.
One total catastrophe like this is just the beginning!
Their glorious deaths shall unite us all in a...
Look out!
Hello?
Matthias?
- Reg.
- Go away.
- Reg, it's me, Brian.
- Get off. Get off out of it.
- Stan?
- Piss off.
- Yeah, piss off.
- Bugger off.
Shit!
Coming.
Yea, verily at that time, which is written in the Book of Obadiah...
...a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey...
...and anyone in the vicinity of either the nephew or the donkey.
My eyes are dim, I cannot see.
- Are you Matthias?
- Yes.
We believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth...
...member of the terrorist organization the People's Front of Judea.
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled, my eyes are old and bent...
Quiet!
Silly person. Guards, search the house.
You know the penalty laid down by Roman law for harbouring a known criminal?
- No.
- Crucifixion.
- Nasty, eh?
- It could be worse.
- What do you mean, "could be worse"?
- Well, you could be stabbed.
Stabbed? It takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.
Well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
You're weird.
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.
Well, don't worry, you've not seen the last of us, weirdo.
- Big nose.
- Watch it!
That was lucky.
- I'm sorry, Reg.
- Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion to our headquarters.
Well, that's all right then, Brian.
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.
You klutz!
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed...
- with a great juicy melon behind.
My legs are old and bent, my ears are grizzled, yes?
There's one place we didn't look. Guards!
I'm just a poor old man, my sight is dim, my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.
- Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
- Crucifixion's a doddle.
Don't keep saying that.
Found this spoon, sir.
Well done, sergeant.
We'll be back, oddball.
- Open up.
- You haven't given us time to hide.
Don't pass judgment on other people, or you might get judged yourself.
What?
I said, don't pass judgment on other people...
...or else you might get judged too.
- Who, me?
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.
- Well, not just you, all of you.
- That's a nice gourd.
- What?
- How much do you want for the gourd?
- You can have it.
- Have it?
- Yes. Consider the lilies.
- Don't you want to haggle?
- No. In the field.
- What's wrong with it, then?
- Nothing, take it.
- Consider the lilies?
- Well, the birds, then.
- What birds?
- Any birds.
- Why?
- Well, have they got jobs?
- Who?
- The birds.
Have the birds got jobs?!
- What's the matter with him?
- He says the birds are scrounging.
No, the point is the birds, they do all right, don't they?
- Well, and good luck to them!
- Yeah, they're very pretty.
Okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against birds.
Consider lilies...
- He's having a go at the flowers now.
- Give the flowers a chance.
- I'll give you one for it.
- It's yours!
Two then.
Look, there was this man, and he had two servants...
- What were they called?
- What?
- What were their names?
- I don't know.
And he gave them some talents...
- You don't know?
- Well, it doesn't matter.
He doesn't know what they were called!
Oh, they were called
Simon and Adrian. Now...
You said you didn't know!
It doesn't matter, the point is there were two servants...
- He's making it up as he goes along!
- No, I'm not!
And he gave them...
Wait a minute, were there three?
- He's terrible.
- There were three...
- He's still a traitor!
- Oh, get off!
Now hear this. Blessed are they...
...who convert their neighbour's ox, for they shall inhibit their girth.
- Rubbish!
- And to them only shall be given...
To them only...
...shall be given...
What?
- Shall be given what?
- Oh, nothing.
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.
- You were going to say something.
- I finished.
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, tell us before you go.
- I wasn't going to say anything.
- No, you hadn't.
- What won't he tell us?
- He won't say.
- Is it a secret?
- No.
- Is it?
- It must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
- Tell us.
- Leave me alone.
- What is the secret?
- Is it the secret of eternal life?
He won't say!
If I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me, please.
- No, tell us, master, we were here first.
- Rubbish!
- Five!
- Go away!
- Tell us, master.
- I can't go above 5.
- Is that his gourd?
- Yes, but it's under offer.
- This is his gourd.
- Ten!
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.
Master?
He's gone. He's been taken up.
- Oh, he has been taken up!
- Eighteen!
No, there he is. Over there.
Look!
- He has given us a sign.
- He has given us his shoe.
The shoe is the sign!
Let us follow his example!
- What?
- Let us, like him...
...hold up one shoe and let the other be upon our foot...
...for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
No, no, the shoe is a sign that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
- Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
- No, let us gather shoes together.
- Let me!
- Oh, get off!
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must think...
...not of the things of the body, but of the face and head!
- Give me your shoe!
- Get off!
Follow the gourd, the holy gourd of Jerusalem!
- The gourd!
- Hold up the sandal, like he has...
- It is a shoe! It is a shoe!
- It's a sandal!
- No, it isn't! It is a shoe!
- Cast it away!
- Put it on!
- Now clear off.
Take the shoes and follow him!
Come all ye who call yourselves Gourdenes.
Stop, I say.
Stop. Let us...
Let us pray.
Yea, he cometh to us like the seed to the grave...
Master!
Hey, is there another way down?
Is there another path down to the river?
Please, please, help me! I've got to get...
My foot!
- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- I'm sorry.
- Damn! Damn and blast it!
- I'm sorry!
Don't you shush me. Eighteen years of total silence, and you shush me.
- What?
- I've kept my vow for 18 years.
Not a single recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
Please be quiet for another five minutes.
It doesn't matter now,
I might as well enjoy myself.
The times in the last 18 years
I wanted to shout and sing...
...and scream my name out!
Oh, I'm alive!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive...
Get off! I'm alive!
Master! Master!
The master! He is here!
- The shoe!
- It was the gourd!
The shoe has brought us!
Speak! Speak to us, master!
Speak to us!
- Go away!
- A blessing! A blessing!
- How shall we go away, master?
- Just go away and leave me alone.
Give us a sign.
He has given us a sign, he has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here!
You just followed me!
It's still a good sign, by any standard.
Master, your people have walked many miles to be with you.
They are weary and have not eaten.
- It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
- There is no food in this high mountain.
What about the juniper bushes over there?
A miracle! A miracle!
He has made the bush fruitful by his word!
They brought forth juniper berries!
Of course they brought forth juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.
What do you expect?!
Show us another miracle.
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!
Is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
- I say, those are my juniper bushes.
- They are a gift from God!
They're all I've bloody got to eat.
I say, get off of those bushes!
Go on! Clear off, the lot of you.
- Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
- I'm healed!
- The master has healed me!
- I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!
A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!
Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
A miracle! He is the Messiah!
- And he hurt my foot!
- Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!
I say you are, Lord.
And I should know, I've followed a few!
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!
Would you please listen, I am not the Messiah, do you understand?
Honestly!
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
What? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
- All right, I am the Messiah!
- He is! He is the Messiah!
Now, fuck off!
- How shall we fuck off, Lord?
- Just go away! Leave me alone!
You told these people to eat my juniper berries.
You break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence...
...and then you try and clean up on my juniper bushes!
Lay off! This is the Messiah, the chosen one!
- No, he's not.
- An unbeliever!
An unbeliever!
- Persecute! Kill the heretic!
- Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill!
- Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone.
Put him down. Please!
Brian?
Judith?
Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!
Brian!
Mother!
- Brian!
- Hang on, Mother!
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "hello, Mother" me.
- What are those people doing out there?
- Well, I...
Come on! What have you been up to, my lad?
I think they must have popped by for something.
Popped by?! Swelled by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!
They started following me yesterday.
Well, they can stop following you right now.
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!
- The who?
- The Messiah!
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.
Now go away!
Brian! Brian!
Right, my lad, what have you been up to?
- Nothing, Mum.
- Come on, out with it.
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
- What have you been telling them?
- Nothing, l...
- You're only making it worse for yourself.
- Look, I can explain...
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!
Those people out there are following him because they believe in him.
They believe he can give them hope.
Hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
- Who's that!?
- That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.
Show us the Messiah!
Now you listen here, he's not the Messiah!
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.
Behold his mother! Behold his mother!
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!
All things to thee, now and always!
Now, don't think you can get around me like that.
He's not coming out, and that's my final word.
Now shove off!
No!
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!
- Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
- Yes!
All right then, you can see him for one minute, but not one second more!
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Promise?
- Well, all right.
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.
- But, Mum, Judith...
- Leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to, Mum.
- Good morning!
- A blessing! A blessing!
No, please. Please, please, listen!
I've got one or two things to say.
Tell us! Tell us both of them!
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.
You don't need to follow anybody!
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!
Yes, we're all individuals!
You're all different.
Yes, we are all different!
I'm not.
You've all got to work it out for yourselves!
Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
Exactly!
- Tell us more!
- No, that's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
- Otherwise... Oh, no!
- That's enough! That's enough.
That wasn't a minute.
- Oh, yes, it was.
- Oh, no, it wasn't!
Now stop that, and go away.
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
Are you a virgin?
I beg your pardon?
Well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
If it's not a personal question?!
How much more personal can you get?
Now piss off.
- She is.
- Must be. Definitely.
Definitely. Definitely.
Morning, Saviour!
Lay your hands on me! Quick!
Now, don't jostle the chosen one!
Please!
Don't push that baby in the
Saviour's face! He'll touch it later!
I say...
Could he see my wife?
She has a headache.
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!
She's very bad, and we've got a luncheon!
Look, the lepers are queuing!
Her brother-in-law is the ex-mayor of Gath.
Can I introduce you to the man who's letting us have the mounts on Sunday?
- Hello.
- Don't push!
Now keep the noise down, please!
Those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control a bit! Can't you?
Incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
Women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
Brian?
Brian! You were fantastic!
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- No, what you said just now!
- Quite extraordinary!
- What? Oh, that. Was it?
We don't need leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long.
- Well, yes...
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian!
You're very attractive.
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!
I think...
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!
What?
No, that's not what I meant at all!
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!
Right!
Stop it!
Well, Brian, you've given us a good run for our money.
A what?
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.
Guard!
Do we have any crucifixions today?
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail!
The crowd are getting restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.
Disperse them?
But I haven't addressed them yet!
No, I know, sir, but...
My address is a high point of Passover!
My friend Biggus Dickus has come all the way from Rome to hear it!
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!
You're not...
You're not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
Give it a miss?!
Well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
Really, centurion!
I'm surprised to hear a man like you rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.
- A bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away!
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!
And crucify him well!
Biggus!
- I really wouldn't, sir!
- Out of the way, centurion!
Let me come with you, Pontius. I may be of assistance if there is a sudden crisis!
Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
- Francis, you've done some work on this?
- Yeah, thank you, Reg.
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...
...unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next 12 months!
- Twelve months?
- Yeah, 12 months.
And let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one.
So we gotta get up off our arses and stop just talking about it!
Hear! Hear!
I agree! It's action that counts, not words, and we need action now!
You're right. We could sit around here all day, talking, passing resolutions...
...making clever speeches, it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless...
...and it's getting us nowhere!
- Right!
I agree!
This is a complete waste of time!
They've arrested Brian!
- What?
- They've dragged him off!
They're gonna crucify him!
Right!
This calls for immediate discussion!
- What?!
- Immediate!
- Right!
- New motion?
Completely new motion!
That there be immediate action...
Once the vote has been taken.
Obviously once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution...
- Reg, let's go now, please!
- Right! Right!
In the light of fresh information from sibling Judith...
- Not so fast, Reg.
- Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple!
All you've gotta do is to go out of that door now...
...and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?
- Yeah, hello.
- Another little ego trip from the feminists.
- What?
- Sorry, Loretta.
Read that back, would you?
Next.
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each.
Next.
Crucifixion?
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each. Next.
- Crucifixion?
- No, freedom.
- What?
- Freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything so I could go free and live on an island.
That's jolly good.
Well, off you go, then.
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.
I see. Very good, very good.
Well, out of the door.
Out of the door, one cross each, line on the left.
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?
- Yes.
- Good.
People of Jerusalem!
Rome is your friend!
To prove our friendship, it is customary at this time...
...to release a wrongdoer from our prisons.
Whom would you have me release?
Release Roger!
Release Roger! Release Roger!
Very well, I shall release Roger!
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.
- What?
- We don't have anyone of that name, sir.
We have no Roger!
But what about Roderick, then?
Release Roderick! Release Roderick!
Centurion, why do they titter so?
Just some Jewish joke, sir.
Are they ragging me?
Oh, no, sir!
Very well. I shall release Roderick!
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.
- No Roger, no Roderick?
- Sorry, sir.
Who is this...?
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?
He is a robber!
And a rapist!
And a pickpocket!
He sounds a notorious criminal.
We haven't got him, sir.
Do we have anyone in our prisons?
- We've got a Samson, sir.
- Samson?
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Silas the Syrian Assassin.
Several seditious scribes from Caesarea.
Sixty-seven...
- Let me speak to them, Pontius!
- Oh, no!
Good idea, Biggus!
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee
Strangler, Silas the Assyrian Assassin...
...several seditious scribes from Caesarea...
Next.
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each. Jailor?
- Excuse me? There's been a mistake...
- Just a moment, would you? Jailor?
- How many have come through?
- What?
How many have come through?
What?
You'll have to speak...
Speak up, sir.
He's... He's d...
He's deaf... Deaf as a post, sir.
How many have come through?
- Oh, dear.
- I make it 90...
Ninety...
Ninety...
Ninety-six, sir.
It's such a senseless waste of human life, isn't it?
No, sir!
Not with these b...
Bastards, sir!
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.
I don't think you could say it's good, it's nasty!
It's not as n...
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.
- Now, crucifixion?
- Is there someone I could speak to?
- Well...
- I know where to get it if you want it.
- What?
- Don't worry about him, sir. He's de...
He's deaf and mad, sir.
Well, how did he get the job?
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!
Get a move on, big nose! There's people waiting to be crucified out here!
Could I see a lawyer or someone?
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable, bloody Romans!
No sense of humour.
Sorry, bit of a hurry.
Can you go straight out, line on the left, one cross each? Now...
Was it something I said?
Silence!
This man commands a crack legion!
He ranks as high as any in Rome!
Crucifixion party?
Morning.
Now, we will be on show as we go through the town, so let's not let the side down!
Keep in a line, three lengths between you and the man in front...
...and a good, steady pace.
Crosses over your left shoulders, and if you keep your backs hard up...
...against the crossbeam you'll be there in no time.
All right, centurion!
Crucifixion party!
Wait for it.
Crucifixion party!
By the left! Forward!
You lucky bastards!
You lucky, jabby bastards!
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!
Thank you.
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?
It's not my cross...
Shut up and get on with it!
Come on!
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!
All right!
I will give you one more chance!
This time I want to hear no Rubens, no Reginalds...
...no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.
No Spencer Tracys!
Or we shall release no one!
Release Brian!
Yeah, that's a good one!
Release Brian! Release Brian!
Very well! That's it!
- Sir, we have got a Brian, sir.
- What?
- You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
- Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.
- Well, go and free him, straight away!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Very well. I shall release Brian!
- Get a move on, there!
- Or what?
Or you'll be in trouble!
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to give up being crucified in the afternoons?
- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?
I wouldn't have nothing to do!
Thank you!
Are they gone?
We've got lumps of it around the back.
What?
Don't worry about him sir, he's ma...
- He's mad, sir.
- Have they gone?
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, sir.
- Anyway, get on with the story.
- Well, I just never really liked them, so l...
Right! The motion to get on with it passed with one abstention.
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a second?
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it! Still a few crosses left!
Up you go, big nose!
I'll get you for this, you bastard!
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.
- No?
- I warn you.
I'm gonna punch you so hard, you Roman git!
Shut up, you Jewish turd!
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!
A Samaritan? This is supposed to be a Jewish section!
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die in a day or two!
It may not matter to you, but it matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?
Oh, rather!
Under the terms of the Roman occupancy...
...we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!
And Swedish separate from Welsh!
All right, all right, all right!
We'll soon settle this!
Hands up, all those who don't want to be crucified here!
Right! Next!
- Look, it's not my cross.
- What?
It's not my cross,
I was holding it for someone.
- Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
- Of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss...
Look, we've had a busy day, and there's 140 of you lot to get up.
- Is he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?!
We don't want more
Samaritans around here.
Belt up!
- Will you let me down if he comes back?
- Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down.
- Next!
- You don't have to do this!
- You don't have to take orders!
- I like orders.
See? Not so bad once you're up.
- You're being rescued then, are you?
- It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?
No, we've got a couple of days up here.
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.
Oh, yeah.
My brother usually rescues me.
If he can keep off the tail for more than 20 minutes.
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.
Hello. Your family arrived then?
Reg!
- Hello, sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.
I think I should point out in fairness that we are not the rescue committee.
However, I have been asked to read this prepared statement...
...on behalf of the movement.
"We, the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, end brackets...
...do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings to you, Brian...
...on this occasion of your martyrdom."
- What?
"Your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing struggle to liberate...
...the parent land from the hands of the Roman imperialist aggressors...
...excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, housing...
...education. And any other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews...

Signed, "On behalf of the P.F.J., et cetera."
And I'd just like to add, on a personal note, my own admiration...
...for what you're doing for us and what must be, after all, for you, a difficult time.
- Reg! What are you going to do?
- Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
Terrific work, Brian.
Right. And:
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of...
You bastards! You bastards!
- Where is Brian of Nazareth?
- You sanctimonious bastards!
- I have an order for his release.
- You stupid bastards!
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- What?
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- Take him down!
I'm Brian of Nazareth!
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!
Look, look, I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian and so is my wife!
- Right! Take him away and release him!
- No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian.
No, I'm not Brian! I was only...
It was a joke.
I'm only pulling your leg!
It's a joke!
I'm not him,
I'm just having you on!
Put me back!
Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.
The Judean People's Front!
The Judean People's Front!
Forward, all!
- Look out! The Judean People's Front!
- The Judean People's Front!
The Judean People's Front!
We are the Judean People's Front, crack suicide squad.
Suicide squad, attack!
That showed them, huh?
You silly sods!
Brian!
Judith!
Terrific! Great! Reg explained it to me, and I think it's great what you're doing.
Thank you, Brian. I'll never forget you.
So there you are!
I might have known it would end up like this.
Just think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you!
Well, if that's how you treat your poor, old mother...
...in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is:
Go ahead. Be crucified.
See if I care.
- I might have known.
- Mum! Mum!
I don't know what the world is coming to.
Cheer up, Brian!
You know what they say?
Some things in life are bad.
They can really make you mad.
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble
Give a whistle
And this'll help things
Turn out for the best
And
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile
And dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle
That's the thing
And always look on
The bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face
The curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it
It's your last chance anyhow
So always look on
The bright side of death
Just before
You draw your terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke
It's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that
The last laugh is on you
And always look on
The bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life
Come on, Brian! Cheer up!
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Worse things happen at sea, you know?
Always look on the bright side of life
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing...
...you're going back to nothing, what have you lost?
Nothing!
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up, you old bugger!
Come on! Give us a grin!
There you are!
See? The end of the film. Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer.
Some of us have got to live as well, you know?
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?
They're not gonna make their money back, you know.
I told them. I said to him.
"Bernie," I said,
"They'll never make their money back."

THE END
Thank you very much, sir.
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
Shh. Shh.
We did it, Pete. We did it.
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.
To continue, you've listened to a long and complex case - murder in the first degree.
A premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts.
You've listened to the testimony.
You've had the law read to you and interpreted as it applies in this case.
It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy.
One man is dead. Another man's life is at stake.
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the guilt of the accused - a reasonable doubt - then you must bring me a verdict of not guilty.
Now if, however, there's no reasonable doubt... then you must in good conscience find the accused guilty.
However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous.
In the event that you find the accused guilty... the bench will not entertain a recommendation for mercy.
The death sentence is mandatory in this case.
You're faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.
The alternate jurors are excused.
The jury will now retire.
Try this one. See if I can get it -
It's a muggy day.
Hey. Oh, oh.
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.
This thing is -
- Huh?
- ... move it.
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.
That's it.
- You know something?
- Yeah?
I called the weather bureau this morning.
This is gonna be the hottest day of the year.
Could be.
Boy, you'd think they'd at least air-condition these places.
- What is your name, sir? -
Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.
Thank you very much.
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.
Good morning.
I never knew they locked the door.
Sure they lock the door. What'd you think?
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.
What's that for?
Oh, I thought we might want to vote by ballot.
Great idea. Maybe we can get him elected senator.
Just in case, you know.
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.
It was pretty interesting.
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
I mean, I've never been on a jury before.
No? I've sat on many juries.
What gets me is the way those lawyers talk and talk and talk... even when it's an open-and-shut case like this one.
Did you ever hear so much talk about nothin'?
Well, I guess they're entitled.
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but -
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble.
It would save us a lot of time and money.
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We probably all got things to do here.
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order? - Gee, I don't know.
I, uh
- Well, I guess so.
Uh, you're in my seat.
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
What did you think of the case?
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?
I tell you, we were lucky to get a murder case.
I figured us for an assault or burglary.
Boy, they can be the dullest.
Hey.
That the Woolworth Building?
That's right.
Isn't that funny?
You know, I've lived here all my life. I've never been inside that.
If you had to sort out all that junk -
Like that thing with the movies.
Yeah. You can say that again. And what about that business with the knife?
I mean, asking grown-up people to believe that kind of jazz, huh?
Well, I expected that. You know what we're dealing with.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.
These hot-weather colds can kill you.
I can hardly touch my nose. You know what I mean?
I sure do. I just got over one.
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman, let's go here, huh?
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance to see a paper this morning.
Hmm?
I was only wondering how the market closed.
You got a seat on the Exchange?
I'm a broker.
I run a messenger service
- the Beck and Call Company.
The name is my wife's idea.
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?
Yeah, we can all get outta here pretty quick, huh?
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen to have tickets to that ball game tonight.
Yanks and Cleveland.
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.
You know
- Phoom!
A real jug handle. You know?
Phoom!
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you? Huh? Yeah.
Where do we sit here?
Well, I thought we'd sit in order, you know, by jury numbers.
One, two, three, four, five
- so on, around the table.
If that's okay with you gentlemen.
- Sure.
- What's the difference?
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around -
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.
What was your impression of the prosecuting attorney?
Okay. Two. You're two.
I beg pardon?
I thought he was really sharp, the way he handled all those points one by one.
Logical sequence. I was very impressed.
I think he
- he did an expert job.
A lot of drive too, you know? Real drive.
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.
Uh, fellas.
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid kills his father
- bing, just like that.
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures, you'll see it happens all the time.
They let those kids run wild up there.
Well, maybe it serves 'em right. You know what I mean?
Is
- Is everyone here?
The old man is inside.
Oh. Would you, uh, knock on the door for him?
You a Yankee fan?
No. Baltimore.
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.
That's like being hit in the head with a crowbar once a day.
Who have they got?
No, I mean, who have they got besides good groundskeepers?
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen. I
- I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
Baltimore?
Okay, gentlemen, if I can have your attention.
You fellas can handle this thing any way that you want to.
I'm, um
- You know, I'm not gonna make any rules.
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first and, uh, then vote on it.
That's, of course, uh
- That's, uh, one way.
And, uh, well, we can vote on it right now, and -
I think it's customary to take a preliminary vote.
Yeah, let's
- Let's vote. Who knows? Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?
Uh-huh.
Okay, then I think that, uh -
Of course you know that we have a first-degree murder charge here... and if we vote the accused guilty... uh, we've got to send him to the chair.
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this has to be 12 to nothing either way.
Um, that's the law.
Okay, are we ready?
Now, all those voting guilty, please raise your hands.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... eight, nine, 10, 11.
Okay. That's 11 guilty.
Those voting not guilty.
One. Right.
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.
Well, now we know where we are.
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
So, what do we do now?
Well, I guess we talk.
Boy, oh, boy.
You really think he's innocent?
I don't know.
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us. You heard what we did.
The kid's a dangerous killer. You could see it.
He's 18 years old.
Well, that's old enough. Î—e -
He stabbed his own father four inches into the chest.
They proved it a dozen different ways in court.
Would you like me to list them for you?
No.
Then what do you want?
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.
No one had to think about it twice except you.
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?
I don't know whether I believe it or not. Maybe I don't.
So how come you vote not guilty?
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.
It's not easy to raise my hand and send a boy off to die... without talking about it first.
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.
What, just because I voted fast?
I honestly think the guy's guilty.
You couldn't change my mind if you talked for a hundred years.
I'm not trying to change your mind. It's just that -
We're talking about somebody's life here.
We can't decide it in five minutes. Supposing we're wrong.
"Supposing we're wrong. "
Supposing this whole building should fall down on my head.
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.
Look, what's the difference how long it takes?
Suppose we do it in five minutes. So what?
Let's take an hour.
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.
Hmm?
Who's got something to say?
I'm willing to sit for an hour.
Great. I heard a pretty good story last night.
That's not why we're sitting here.
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?
I don't know. Maybe no reason.
Look, this kid's been kicked around all of his life - you know, born in a slum, mother dead since he was nine.
He lived for a year and a half in an orphanage when his - his father was serving a jail term for forgery.
It's not a very happy beginning.
He's a
- a wild, angry kid.
That's all he's ever been. And you know why?
'Cause he's been hit on the head by somebody once a day every day.
He's had a
- He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.
I
- I just think we owe him a few words. That's all.
I don't mind telling you this, mister. We don't owe him a thing.
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.
We heard the facts, didn't we?
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
Listen, I've lived among them all my life.
You can't believe a word they say. You know that.
I mean, they're born liars.
- Only an ignorant man can believe that. - Now listen -
Do you think you were born with a monopoly on the truth?
I think certain things should be pointed out to this man.
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.
Come on. We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce. "
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.
Yeah, we have all this work to do.
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.
Okay. Um... perhaps if the gentleman down there who's disagreeing with us -
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You know, let us know what you're thinking.
And we might be able to show you where you're mixed up.
Well, look, maybe
- Maybe this is an idea.
Now, I haven't given it much thought, but it seems to me... that it's up to the group of us to convince this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.
Now, maybe if we each took a couple of minutes just to -
Well, it was just a quick idea.
No, no, no. That's a good one.
Uh, suppose we go once around the table.
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.
Well, uh -
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.
I just think he's guilty.
I thought it was obvious from the word "go. "
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
The defendant doesn't even have to open his mouth.
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.
Uh, what I meant was, is -
Well, I just think he's guilty.
I
- I mean, somebody saw him do it.
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I have no personal feelings about this.
I just want to talk about facts.
Number one.
The old man lived downstairs under the room where the killing took place.
At 10 minutes after 12:00 on the night of the killing... he heard loud noises, said it sounded like a fight.
And he heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "
A second later, he heard a body hit the floor.
Ran to the door, opened it up... saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house.
Called the police.
They came in, found the old man with a knife in his chest.
The coroner fixed the time of death around midnight.
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.
The kid is guilty.
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
I know he's only 18, but he's still gotta pay for what he did.
I'm with you.
Okay. Are you finished?
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.
It is obvious, to me anyway, that the boy's entire story was flimsy.
He claimed he was at the movies during the time of the killing... and yet, one hour later, he couldn't remember the names of the films he saw...
- or who played in them.
- That's right.
And no one saw him going in or out of the theater.
Listen, what about the woman across the street?
If her testimony don't prove it, nothing does.
That's right. She was the one who actually saw the killing.
Now, fellas, please. Let's go in order here, huh?
Just a minute. Here's a woman -
Here's a woman who was lying in bed. She can't sleep.
She's dying with the heat. You know what I mean?
Anyway, she looks out the window... and right across the street she sees the kid stick the knife into his father.
The time is 12:10 on the nose.
Everything fits.
Look, she's known the kid all his life.
His window is right opposite hers across the el tracks... and she swore she saw him do it.
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.
This el train had no passengers on it. It was just being moved downtown.
The lights were out, remember? And they proved in court that, at night... you can look through the windows of an el train when the lights are out... and see what's happening on the other side.
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?
She's one of them too, isn't she?
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
Oh, what's he so wise about? I'm telling you.
Okay, now come on. Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.
Whose turn is it next?
Oh, uh, his. Number five.
Okay, may I -
Can I pass? It -
Well, uh, that's your privilege.
Uh, how about the next gentleman?
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.
I started to be convinced, you know, very early in the case.
You see, I was looking for a motive. That's very important.
Because if you don't have a motive, where's your case, right?
Anyway, that, uh, testimony from those people... in the apartment across the hall from the kid's apartment - that was very powerful.
Didn't they say something about a
- a fight and an argument... between the old man and his son around about, uh, 7:00 that night?
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I - - It was 8:00.
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.
They couldn't hear what it was about.
Then they heard the father hit the boy twice.
- Finally they saw the boy run angrily out of the house.
What does that prove?
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.
Well, you said it provided a motive. The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.
I don't think that was a very strong motive.
This boy's been hit so many times in his life that violence is practically a -
It's a normal state of affairs with him.
I just
- I can't see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder.
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.
Anything else?
- No.
- Okay.
Uh, how about you?
I don't know. It's all been said.
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.
This kid is five for 0.
Well, look at his record.
When he was 10, he was in children's court.
He threw a rock at a teacher.
When he was 15, he was in reform school.
He stole a car.
He's been arrested for mugging.
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.
Oh, yeah, they say he's real handy with a knife.
Oh, this is a very fine boy.
Ever since he was five years old, his father beat him up regularly.
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.
A kid like that?
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.
When I was a kid, I used to call my father "sir. "
That's right. "Sir. "
Do you ever hear a kid call his father that anymore?
Fathers don't seem to think it's important anymore.
- You got any kids?
- Three.
I got one.
Twenty-two years old.
When he was nine years old, he ran away from a fight.
I saw it. I was so embarrassed I almost threw up.
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you if I have to break you in two trying. "
Well, I made a man out of him.
When he was 16, we had a fight.
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.
Haven't seen him for two years.
Kids.
Work your heart out.
Well, let's get going.
I think we're missing the point here.
This boy, let's say he's the product of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.
We can't help that. We're here to decide whether he's innocent or guilty... not to go into the reasons why he grew up the way he did.
He was born in a slum. Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
I know it, and so do you.
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds are potential menaces to society.
- Now I think - - Brother, you can say that again.
The kids who crawl out of these places are real trash.
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum all my life. - Wait a minute.
Please, I
- I played in backyards that were filled with garbage.
I mean, maybe you can still smell it on me.
Now, listen, sonny.
Come on now. There's nothing personal about this.
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
Let's not be so sensitive.
This sensitivity I can understand.
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and -
Look, your turn down there. Let's go.
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought you were all gonna try to convince me.
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?
He's the one who's keeping us in here. Let's hear what he's got to say.
Oh, now wait a minute. We decided to do this a certain way.
I think we ought to stick to that way.
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?
K- I-D.
Kid.
What? Listen, just because I'm trying to keep this thing organized?
Here, you take it. You take on the responsibility.
I'll just
- I'll keep my mouth shut. That's all.
What are you getting so hot about? Calm down, will you?
Don't tell me to calm down.
Here. You wanna take the chair, just take the chair. That's all.
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.
The whole thing's unimportant. Come on.
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.
You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down.
Yeah, you're doing great. Just great, fella.
You stay in there and pitch. You know?
All right. Let's hear from somebody.
Well, if you want me to tell you how I feel about it, it's all right with me.
Boy, I don't care what you do.
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.
I only know as much as you do.
According to the testimony, the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
I sat there in court for six days listening while the evidence built up.
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?
I
- I began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial.
I mean, nothing is that positive.
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't have meant anything, but -
I began to get the feeling that the defense counsel... wasn't conducting a thorough-enough cross-examination.
I mean, he - he let too many things go by, little things that -
What little things? Listen, when these fellas don't ask questions... it's because they know the answers already and they figure they'll be hurt.
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer to be just plain stupid, isn't it?
I mean it's possible.
You sound like you met my brother-in-law once.
I
- I kept putting myself in the kid's place.
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness to this killing.
Someone else claims he heard the killing, saw the boy run out afterwards.
And there was a lot of circumstantial evidence.
But actually, those two witnesses were the entire case for the prosecution.
Supposing they're wrong.
What do you mean supposing they're wrong?
What's the point of having witnesses at all?
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?
Those people sat on the stand under oath.
They're only people.
People make mistakes.
Could they be wrong?
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?
Oh, come on. Nobody can know a thing like that.
This isn't an exact science.
That's right. It isn't.
Okay, let
- Let's get to the point.
What about the switch knife they found in the old man's chest?
Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's some people who haven't talked yet.
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.
Be quiet a second, will you?
What about it, this - the knife this fine upright boy admitted buying the night of the killing?
Let's talk about it.
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.
I'd like to see it again. Mr. Foreman?
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?
The gentleman has a right to see exhibits in evidence.
Say, could you bring us the knife?
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.
The knife and the way it was bought is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?
- I do.
- Good.
Now, suppose we take these facts one at a time.
One. The boy admitted going out of the house at 8:00 on the night of the murder... after being slapped several times by his father.
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped. " He said "punched. "
There's a difference between a slap and a punch.
After being hit several times by his father.
Two. He went directly to a neighborhood junk shop...
- where he bought one of those - - Switch knives.
Switchblade knives.
This wasn't what you'd call an ordinary knife.
It had a very unusual carved handle and blade.
The storekeeper who sold it to him... said it was the only one of its kind he had ever had in stock.
Three. He met some friends of his in front of a tavern about 8:45.
Am I right so far?
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.
He talked with his friends for about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.
During this time, they saw the switch knife.
Four.
They identified the death weapon in court... as that very same knife.
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.
Now this is where the stories offered by the State and the boy... begin to diverge slightly.
He claims that he went to a movie at about 11:30... returning home at 3:10 to find his father dead and himself arrested.
He also claims that the two detectives who arrested him... threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
Now, what happened to the switch knife?
He claims that it fell through a hole in his pocket on the way to the movies... sometime between 11:30 and 3:10 and that he never saw it again.
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.
I think it's quite clear that the boy never went to the movies that night.
No one in the house saw him go out at 11:30.
No one at the theater identified him.
He couldn't even remember the names of the pictures he saw.
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.
The boy stayed home, had another fight with his father... stabbed him to death and left the house at 10 minutes after 12:00.
He even remembered to wipe the knife clean of fingerprints.
Now are you trying to tell me that this knife... really fell through a hole in the boy's pocket... someone picked it up off the street, went to the boy's house... and stabbed his father with it just to test its sharpness?
No. I'm just saying it's possible the boy lost his knife... and that somebody else stabbed his father with a similar knife.
It's just possible.
Take a look at this knife.
It's a very unusual knife.
I've never seen one like it.
Neither had the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.
Aren't you asking us to accept a pretty incredible coincidence?
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
And I say it's not possible.
Where did that come from?
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.
What do you think you're doing?
Where did you get it?
I went out walking for a couple of hours last night.
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.
I bought that at a little pawnshop just two blocks from the boy's house.
It cost six dollars.
It's against the law to buy or sell switchblade knives.
That's right. I broke the law.
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.
Maybe there are 10 knives like that. So what?
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?
You found another knife like it. What's that, the discovery of the age or something?
You mean you're asking us to believe that somebody else did the stabbing... with exactly the same kind of knife?
The odds are a million-to-one.
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
There's no point in standing around all over the place.
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.
What's interesting about it? "Interesting. "
Well, I don't know. I just thought it was interesting.
There are still 11 of us here who think he's guilty.
Right. What do you think you're gonna accomplish?
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.
So if you wanna be stubborn and hang this jury, go ahead.
The kid will be tried again and found guilty sure as he's born.
That's probably right.
So what are you gonna do? You know, we could be here all night.
It's only one night. A boy may die.
Well, why don't we just set up house here, huh?
Someone send for Potsy the policeman and get a pinochle deck... and, uh, we'll just sweat the whole thing out right here.
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff about the knife's got to do with anything.
Somebody saw the kid stab his father. What more do we need?
You guys can talk the ears right off my head. You know what I mean?
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot while you're talking.
So let's get done and get outta here.
The knife was very important to the district attorney. He spent a whole day -
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?
Hey, let's hold it down.
These side arguments are only slowing us up.
Well, what about it?
You're the only one.
I have a proposition to make to all of you.
I'm gonna call for another vote.
I want you 11 men to vote by secret written ballot.
I'll abstain.
If there are 11 votes for guilty, I won't stand alone.
We'll take in a guilty verdict to the judge right now.
But if anyone votes not guilty, we stay here and talk it out.
Well, that's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.
All right. Let's do it the hard way.
Okay, that sounds fair. Everyone agreed?
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.
Here, pass these along.
Is that the right time?
"Guilty. "
"Not guilty. "
"Guilty. "
Boy, how do you like that?
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
We all agreed on that, no?
If the gentleman wanted to remain secret -
Secret? What do you mean secret?
There are no secrets in a jury room. I know who it was.
Brother, you really are something.
You sit here, vote guilty like the rest of us... and then some golden-voiced preacher starts tearin' your poor heart out... about some underprivileged kid just couldn't help becomin' a murderer... and you change your vote.
If that isn't the most sick -
Why don't you drop a quarter in his collection box?
Oh, now just wait a minute.
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.
No. Who does he think he is? Did you hear him?
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!
We're trying to put a guilty man in the chair where he belongs!
Someone starts telling us fairy tales, and we're listenin'!
Hey, uh, come on, huh?
What made you change your vote?
He didn't change his vote.
I did.
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.
Would you like me to tell you why?
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.
I'd like to make it clear anyway, if you don't mind.
Do we have to listen to this?
The man wants to talk.
Thank you.
This gentleman has been standing alone against us.
Now, he doesn't say the boy is not guilty.
He just isn't sure.
Well, it's not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others.
So he gambled for support, and I gave it to him.
I respect his motives.
The boy on trial is probably guilty, but, uh, I want to hear more.
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.
I'm talking here! You have no right to leave this room!
He can't hear you. He never will.
Let's sit down.
Shall we continue?
Well, I
- I think we ought to take a break.
You know, one man's inside, and
I think we ought to wait for him.
Okay.
Looks like we're really hung up here, huh?
And that thing with the old man, that was pretty unexpected.
I wish I could figure out some way we could break it up.
You know, in advertising
- I told you I worked in an agency.
Mm-hmm.
Well, there's some pretty strange people working there.
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.
It's just that they have peculiar ways of expressing themselves.
You know what I mean.
Of course, I suppose it's the same in your business too, huh?
What do you do?
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers in the world come from Europe, huh?
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency, when we reach a point like this -
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when a point like this is reached in a meeting... there's always some character ready with an idea, see.
And it kills me.
It's the weirdest thing in the world... the way they sometimes precede their idea with a little phrase, see, like -
Some account exec will get up, and he'll say, uh...
"Okay, here's an idea.
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it. "
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?
I, uh - I got a little excited back there. I - didn't mean to get nasty.
I'm glad you're not one of those lets these emotional appeals influence him.
Uh -
I don't know what's the matter with that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.
# Be, be, be #
# Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ##
Eh!
Hey, you a salesman?
I'm an architect.
Hmm.
You know what the soft sell is?
Boy, you got it. Believe me.
I got a different technique.
Laughs, drinks, jokes.
Tricks. You know?
Yeah.
"Hit 'em where they live. " That's my motto.
I made 27 grand last year sellin' marmalade.
That's not bad. I mean, you know, considering marmalade.
Hey, what are you gettin' outta this
- kicks?
Or did somebody bump you on the head one time and you haven't gotten over it?
Maybe.
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.
You're always blowing your stacks over some guy that fanned.
But what are you wasting our time for?
Why don't you donate five dollars to the cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.
This kid is guilty, pal.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
So why don't we stop wasting our time here?
We're gonna all get sore throats if we keep it up, you know?
What difference does it make if you get it here or at the ball game?
Oh, no difference, pal.
No difference at all.
Nice bunch of guys, huh?
Oh, they're about the same as anyone else.
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.
You think we'll be much longer?
I don't know.
Aw, he's guilty for sure.
Not a doubt in the whole world.
We should
- Should've been done already.
Oh, I don't mind, you know.
Hmm. Beats workin'.
Uh -
You think he's not guilty, huh?
I don't know. It's possible.
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin' you never been wronger in your life.
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.
Supposing you were the one who was on trial.
Well, I'm not used to supposing.
I'm just a workingman. My boss does the supposing. But -
Well, I'll try one.
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and, uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?
Are you ready?
Hup.
That one.
Sorry, blue eyes.
- Well, where else - - Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
Looks like we'll be here for dinner, huh?
Okay, now let's
- Let's get down to business.
Now, who wants to start it off?
- I would.
- Okay, go.
You down there.
The old man who lived downstairs says he heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "
A second later, he heard the body hit the floor.
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house.
What does that mean to you?
I was wondering how clearly the old man could have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.
He didn't hear it through the ceiling. The window was open.
So was the one upstairs. It was a hot night, remember?
Well, it was another apartment.
It's not that easy to identify a voice, particularly a shouting voice.
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.
And don't forget the lady across the street.
She looked right in the open window and saw the boy stab his father.
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?
It's like talking into a dead phone.
She said she saw the killing through the windows of a moving elevated train.
There were six cars on the train. She saw the killing through the last two cars.
She remembered the most insignificant details.
I don't see how you can argue with that.
Has anybody here any idea how long it would take an el -
Hey!
This isn't a game.
- Did you see him?
- Hey.
- The nerve. -
All right, listen -
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.
Has anybody any idea how long it takes an elevated train... going at medium speed to pass a given point?
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?
I think that's a pretty good guess. Anyone else?
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.
Now let's say the given point is the open window of the room where the killing took place.
You can reach out of that window and almost touch the el tracks, right?
Now let me ask you this.
Has anyone here ever lived near the el tracks?
Well, uh, I just finished painting an apartment that overlooked an el line.
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?
Oh, brother. Don't matter though. We were all punchy.
I lived in a second-floor apartment near the el line once.
When the window was open and the train goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
All right, you can't hear yourself think.
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.
Let's take two pieces of testimony and try to put them together.
First. The old man in the apartment downstairs.
He says he heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you"... and a split second later heard a body hit the floor.
- One second later, right?
- That's right.
Second. The woman across the street swore positively she looked out of the window... and saw the killing through the last two cars of the passing elevated train, right?
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?
Now, just a minute.
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds for a train to pass a given point.
Since the woman saw the killing through the last two cars... we can assume that the body hit the floor just as the train went by.
Therefore, the train had been roaring by the old man's window... a full 10 seconds before the body hit the floor.
The old man, according to his own testimony -
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting the floor a split second later - would have had to hear the boy make this statement... with the el roaring past his nose.
It's not possible he could've heard it.
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?
He said he yelled at the top of his voice. That's good enough for me.
Even if he heard something, he still couldn't have identified the voice.
With the el roaring by?
You're talking about a matter of seconds! Nobody can be that accurate.
I think testimony that could put a boy into the electric chair should be that accurate.
You know something? I don't think he could've heard it.
Maybe he didn't hear it. I mean, with all that el noise.
Oh, what are you people talking about?
Well, it stands to reason he couldn't have heard it.
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?
Attention maybe.
You keep coming in with these bright sayings!
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper? They pay three dollars apiece.
What are you talking to him like that for?
Guy talks like that to an old man really ought to get stepped on, you know?
You ought to have more respect, mister.
If you say stuff like that to him again, I'm gonna lay you out.
Now you go ahead. You
- You say anything you like.
Why do you think the old man might lie?
It was just that I looked at him for a very long time.
The seams of his jacket was split, under the shoulder.
Or did you notice that?
I mean, to come to court like that.
Why -
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.
And he walked very slowly to the stand.
He was dragging his left leg and trying to hide it - because he was ashamed.
I think I know this man better than anyone here.
This is a quiet, frightened, insignificant old man who - who has been nothing all his life... who has never had recognition... or his name in the newspapers.
Nobody knows him.
Nobody quotes him.
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing
- to be nothing.
A man like this needs to be quoted, to be listened to.
To be quoted just once.
Very important to him.
It would be so hard for him to recede into the background -
- Wait a minute. - When there was a chance -
What are you trying to do
- tell us he'd lie just so he could be important once?
No. He wouldn't really lie.
But perhaps he made himself believe he heard those words... and recognized the boy's face.
That's the most fantastic story I've ever heard.
How can you make up a thing like that? What do you know about it?
Oh, uh, does anybody want a cough drop?
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.
You can say what you like. I still don't see how anybody can think he's not guilty.
There's something else I'd like to talk about for a minute.
Thanks.
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you. "
- But supposing - - You didn't prove it at all.
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.
This phrase, how many times have all of us used it?
Probably thousands.
"I could kill you for that, darling. "
"Junior, you do that once more, and I'm gonna kill you. "
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him. "
We say it every day. That doesn't mean we're really gonna kill anybody.
Wait a minute. What are you trying to give us here?
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you. "
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
Anybody says a thing like that the way he said it, they mean it.
Well, gee, now I don't know.
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you believe things that aren't so.
The kid said he was gonna kill him, and he did kill him.
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the boy would shout out a thing like that... so the whole neighborhood could hear him?
I don't think so. He's much too bright for that.
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.
"He doesn't even speak good English. "
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to change my vote to not guilty.
You what?
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
The vote is nine to three, favor of guilty.
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?
What are you basing it on
- the stories this guy made up?
You ought to write for one of those kooky detective magazines.
You'd make a fortune.
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.
Right from the beginning, his own lawyer knew it.
You could see it.
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you, this guy here is really something.
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?
He was court-appointed.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.
It could mean he didn't want the case, or he resented being appointed.
It's the kind of case that brings him nothing - no money, no glory, not even much chance of winning.
That's not a very promising situation for a young lawyer.
He'd really have to believe in his client to put up any kind of a good case... and, as you pointed out a minute ago, obviously he didn't.
Of course he didn't. Huh.
Who the heck could?
Except maybe some guy's mother or somebody. I -
Ah, look. Will you look at the time, huh?
- Come on. For crying out - - Pardon me.
- I have made some notes here - - Notes. and I would like to
- please, to say something.
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.
And, uh, it seems to me that this man has some very good points to make.
From what was presented at the trial, the boy looks guilty on the surface.
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?
There is a question I would like to ask.
Let us assume that the boy really did commit the murder.
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.
Now, how was he caught by the police?
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so... and he was captured by two detectives in the hallway of his house.
Now, my question is, if he really had killed his father... why would he come back home three hours later?
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
He came home to get his knife.
It's not nice to go around leaving knives sticking in people's chests.
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.
I don't see anything funny about it.
The boy knew the knife could be identified as the one he had just bought.
He had to get it before the police did.
But if he knew the knife could be identified, why did he leave it there in the first place?
Well, I think we can assume the boy ran out in a state of panic... after having just killed his father.
When he finally calmed down, he realized he had left his knife there.
Ah. This then depends on your definition of panic.
He would have had to be calm enough to see to it... that there were no fingerprints left on the knife.
Now, where did this panic start and where did it end?
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?
I don't believe I have to be loyal to one side or the other.
I'm simply asking questions.
Well, this is just off the top of my head, but, uh... well, if I were the boy and I'd done the stabbing and everything...
I'd take a chance and go back for the knife.
I'll bet he figured that nobody had seen him running out... and that the body wouldn't be discovered till the next day.
Well, after all, it was the middle of the night.
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would find the body till the next day.
Pardon. This is my whole point.
The woman across the street testified that the moment after she saw the killing - that is, a moment after the train went by... she screamed and then went to telephone the police.
Now, the boy certainly must have heard the scream... so he knew that somebody saw something.
I just don't think that he would have gone back.
Two things. One, in his state of panic, he may not have heard the scream.
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
Two, if he did hear it, he may not have connected it with his own act.
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood where screams were fairly commonplace.
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.
Maybe the boy did kill his father, didn't hear the scream... did run out in a panic, did calm down three hours later... and come back to get the knife, risking being caught by the police.
Maybe all of those things happened, but maybe they didn't.
I think there's enough doubt that we can wonder whether he was there at all... during the time the killing took place.
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?
Didn't the old man see him running out of the house?
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.
Did or didn't the old man see the kid running out of the house at 12:10?
Well, did or didn't he?
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.
Or when he wants them to, they do. You know what I mean?
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.
Maybe what we need is a little yelling in here.
These guys keep going off every which way.
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.
What difference does it make? You people are talking only about the little details.
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here -
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!
There's another vote called for. Now let's take our seats.
I never saw so much time spent on nothing.
It only takes a second.
Okay. I guess the fastest way is to find out who's voting not guilty.
Now, all those voting not guilty, please raise your hands.
Still the same. One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.
So, now where are we?
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?
Pardon. I vote not guilty.
Oh!
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're all going crazy in here or something.
The kid is guilty. Why don't you listen to the facts?
Tell him, will ya? Now this is getting to be a joke.
The vote is eight to four, favor of guilty.
What is this, love your underprivileged brother week or something?
I want you to get up and tell me why you changed your vote.
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words. Here, look at this.
The kid you just decided isn't guilty was seen ramming this into his father.
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?
Oh, brilliant.
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling stories out of thin air, you know?
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight... he'd be trying to tell you that, uh -
Look. Now, what about the old man?
Are we supposed to believe that he didn't get up and run to his door... and see the kid tearing down the steps 15 seconds after the killing?
He's just saying so to be important, right?
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter is heard from again now... and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits wherever we look.
Hold it a second. Now, look
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I don't see how he could have run to the door.
Î—e said he went from his bedroom to the front door.
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.
- Don't you remember that?
- No.
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see a diagram of the apartment.
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again so you can get everything straight?
- Mr. Foreman.
How come you're the only one in this room wants to see exhibits all the time?
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.
If we're gonna start wading through all that nonsense about where the body was found -
We're not, not unless somebody else wants to.
But I'd like to find out if an old man... who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year... can get from his bedroom to his front door in 15 seconds.
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.
He said 20 seconds. What are you trying to distort -
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?
You can't judge a thing like that.
He said 15 seconds. He was very positive about it.
He was an old man. Half the time he was confused.
How could he be positive about anything?
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.
Well, let's see if the details bear him out.
As soon as the body hit the floor, he said he heard footsteps upstairs... running toward the front door... heard the upstairs door open, the footsteps start down the stairs.
He said he got to his own front door as fast as he could... and he swore it couldn't have been more than 15 seconds.
Now, if the killer began running immediately -
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.
You ought to be at Atlantic City at that hairsplitters convention.
Hey, why don't you stop makin' smart remarks all the time, huh?
My friend, for your three dollars a day, you have to listen to everything, you know?
Now that you've got that thing in here, what about it?
All right. Here's the apartment where the killing took place.
The old man's apartment was directly beneath and exactly the same.
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom.
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.
Now, the old man was in this bedroom right here.
He says he crossed to the door and walked down the hall... opened the front door just in time to see the boy running down the stairs.
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.
Now, let's see. It was -
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door. The hall is 43 feet.
He would have had to walk 12 feet, open the bedroom door... walk 43 feet down and open the front door all in 15 seconds.
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.
He can walk only very slowly. They had to help him into the witness chair.
You make it sound like a long walk.
For an old man who had a stroke, it is a long walk.
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.
What do you mean, you want to try it? Why didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?
Listen, smart guy. Don't matter whether I thought of it.
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would hurt his case. What do you think of that?
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.
Pass me that chair, will you? Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
I just paced off 12 feet across the room. This will be the bedroom door.
Oh, that's crazy. You can't recreate a thing like that.
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.
I'll pace from that wall and back again.
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.
Come on. Knock it off.
Okay.
Okay. Okay, killer.
Yeah.
Will you stand right there and mark the front door?
It was chain-locked according to the testimony, remember?
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.
When you want me to start, stamp your foot. That'll be the body falling.
You can time me from there.
What are we gonna do, play charades now?
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.
Well, I want to wait till the second hand reaches 60.
Oh, come on.
Come on. Speed it up. He could walk twice as fast as that.
You want me to walk faster than that, I will.
Lock. Door. Stop.
- Right.
- What's the time?
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.
This is what I think happened.
The old man heard the fight between the boy and his father a few hours earlier.
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the body hit the floor in the boy's apartment... heard the woman scream from across the street, got to his front door as fast as he could... heard somebody racing down the stairs and assumed it was the boy.
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?
Oh.
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in my day, but this little display takes the cake.
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding all over the floor about slum kids and injustice.
You listen to some fairy tales.
Suddenly you start getting through to some of these old ladies.
Well, you're not getting through to me. I've had enough.
What's the matter with you guys?
You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!
You're letting him slip through our fingers.
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?
I'm one of 'em!
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.
For this kid, you bet I would.
I feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to want to pull the switch.
Ever since you walked into this room, you've been acting like a self-appointed public avenger.
You want to see this boy die because you personally want it, not because of the facts.
- You're a sadist. - You -
Let me go! I'll kill him. I'll kill him!
You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen? I heard some noise.
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's -
Um, listen, we're through with that diagram. You can take it if you want.
Here you are. Thank you.
What are you lookin' at?
I suppose somebody has to start it off again.
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon. " What are you so polite about?
For the same reason you're not.
It's the way I was brought up.
This fighting -
That's not why we are here, to fight.
We have a responsibility.
This, I have always thought, is a remarkable thing about democracy... that we are -
Uh, what is the word?
Notified. That we are notified by mail... to come down to this place to decide on the guilt or innocence... of a man we have never heard of before.
We have nothing to gain or lose by
- by our verdict.
This is one of the reasons why we are strong.
We should not make it a personal thing.
Thank you.
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.
I mean, I haven't given it much thought, but let's throw it out on the stoop... and see if the cat licks it up.
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy -
Look how dark it's getting out there.
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?
No, I don't.
Well, listen. I, uh -
I was wondering if, uh, maybe - maybe we should take another vote.
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.
I think we ought to have an open ballot
- call out our votes, you know.
Let's see who stands where.
That sounds fair to me. Anyone object?
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers. One.
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.
Two?
Not guilty.
- Number three?
- Guilty.
Number four?
Guilty.
- Number five?
- Not guilty.
- Number six?
- Not guilty.
Number seven?
Guilty.
Number eight?
Not guilty.
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.
- Number 10?
- Guilty.
Number 11?
Not guilty.
Number 12?
Number 12.
Guilty.
The vote is now six to six.
Yeah, right. And we go into extra innings here, huh?
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you people in here must be out of your minds.
A kid like that.
I don't think the kind of boy he is has anything to do with it.
The facts are supposed to determine the case.
Don't give me that! I'm sick and tired of facts!
You can twist them any way you like. You know what I mean?
That's exactly the point this gentleman has been making.
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.
I'd like to be a few years younger.
That man gets on my -
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?
No. No, thanks. Thanks.
It's gonna rain.
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
How come you changed your vote?
Well, it just seemed to me there was room for doubt.
You haven't got a leg to stand on. You know that, I hope.
I don't feel that way. There were a lot of details that never came out.
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.
You think too much. You get mixed up.
- You know what I mean? - Now, listen.
I don't think you have any right -
Loudmouth.
Look at that come down, will you?
You know... this reminds me of a storm we had last -
Oh, when was that? November -
I don't know. Something. It was quite a storm we had there.
It was right in the middle of a game.
Uh, we were behind 7-6... but we just started to move the ball, right off the tackle.
Started cutting right
- slash here and slash right in... cut right through.
And, uh -
We had this kid Slattery, you know?
A real
- He was an ox. You know, a real ox.
I wish I had another one just like him.
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.
And, uh, anyway... we're starting to move along real nice.
Their whole line is just
- they're just coming apart.
And it starts to come down cats and dogs, just like this.
Just whoosh
- you know, right down.
Well, that was murder, you know?
I swear, I
- I nearly bawled.
You just
- You couldn't go nowhere.
Well.
Hey, what is it with this fan here? How come -
Hey! Î—uh?
Must have been on the same switch with the lights.
Well, things are looking up here, huh?
Yeah, huh?
Boy. That's better.
Hey!
Two points.
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?
That's a damn stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh -
You know?
Pardon me.
Well, how do you like it? Even Steven.
Pretty surprising, isn't it?
Yes.
Say, that business before, when that tall guy - what's-his-name - was trying to bait me
- That doesn't prove anything.
I'm a pretty excitable person.
I mean, where does he come off calling me a public avenger, sadist and everything?
Anyone in his right mind would blow his stack, huh?
He was just trying to bait me.
He did an excellent job.
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.
I'm ready to walk into court right now and declare a hung jury.
There's no point in this thing going on anymore.
Yeah. I go for that too.
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury. We haven't been in here very long.
Well, let's find out.
I'm not in favor of that.
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance with another jury, and you know it.
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna change his vote. Let's take it inside.
You still don't think there's room for reasonable doubt?
No, I don't.
Pardon.
Maybe you don't fully understand the term "reasonable doubt. "
What do you mean I don't understand?
Boy, how do ya like this guy?
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.
They come over here, running for their life, and before they can take a deep breath... they're telling us how to run the show, huh?
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.
Hey, all right. Let's stop the arguing for about two minutes in here.
Now, who's got something constructive to say?
I'd like to go over something, if you gentlemen don't mind.
An important point for the prosecution was the fact... that after the boy claimed he'd been at the movies... during the hours that the killing took place... couldn't remember the names of the movies or the stars who appeared in them.
This gentleman here has put up that point in here several times.
That's correct.
It was the only alibi the boy offered... and he himself couldn't back it up with any details at all.
Putting yourself in the boy's place, do you think you could remember details... after an upsetting experience such as being slapped in the face by your father?
I think so, if there were any special details to remember.
The boy couldn't remember the names of the movies he saw because be wasn't there that night.
According to the police testimony in court... the boy was questioned by the detectives in the kitchen of his apartment... while the body of his father was lying on the floor in the bedroom.
Do you think you could remember details under those circumstances?
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.
He named the pictures and the stars who played in them.
Yes. His lawyer took great pains to bring that out.
He had three months from the night of the murder to the day of the trial... in which to memorize them.
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out what played at a particular theater... on a particular night.
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who interrogated the boy right after the murder... when he couldn't remember a thing about the movies... great emotional stress or not.
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?
No, it's all right.
I left the office at 8:30 and went straight home and to bed.
And the night before that?
That was, uh, Tuesday night?
The night of the bridge tournament. I played bridge.
Monday night?
When you get down to New Year's
Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?
Monday night?
Monday night, uh, my wife and I went to the movies.
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?
The, um -
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh -
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something -
The -
Mrs. Bainbridge. The
Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
Uh,yes. The Amazing Mrs.
Bainbridge. I think that's right.
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?
Barbara... Long, I think it was.
A dark, very pretty girl.
Ling or Long
- something like that.
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.
It was a very inexpensive second feature with, uh, unknown -
And you weren't under an emotional stress, were you?
No.
I wasn't.
I think the point is made.
Big point!
You can talk till your tongue is draggin' on the floor.
The boy is guilty, period. You know what I mean, my friend?
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
There goes your ball game.
It's only a shower.
Besides, they got the infield covered.
Right. Say, could I see that knife a second, please?
Well, we're still tied up six to six.
Who's got a suggestion?
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.
Why don't we wait till 7:00, give it another hour, huh?
Okay with me.
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.
I mean, it's been bothering me a little, and as long as we're stuck.
Well, there was this whole business about the stab wound and how it was made - the downward angle of it, you know?
Don't tell me we're gonna start with that again.
They've been over it and over it.
Well, I know they did, but
I don't go along with it.
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall. His father was 6'2".
That's a difference of seven inches.
It's a very awkward thing to stab down into the chest of someone... who's more than half a foot taller than you are.
Give me that.
I'll give you a demonstration. Somebody get up.
You -
I want you to watch this 'cause I don't want to have to do it again.
I'll make myself about six or seven inches shorter, okay?
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.
That's not funny.
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?
Right. Nobody hurt.
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man who was taller than I was.
Look at the angle
- down and in.
And this is the way it was done.
Now tell me I'm wrong.
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?
Can you give me that?
Boy, I hate these things.
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.
- You?
- No.
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop... the lot across the street, backyard.
Switchblades came with the neighborhood where I lived.
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.
See, you use too much time switching hands.
Here's how
- underhanded.
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife wouldn't handle it any other way.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
That's why they're made to open like that.
- You'd say the boy was pretty handy with a knife? - Mm-hmm.
You think he could have made the kind of wound that killed his father?
No. Not with the experience he'd had all his life handling these things.
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.
How do you know? Were you in the room when the father was killed?
No. Neither was anybody else.
So what are you giving us all this mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
I don't think you can determine what type of wound the boy might or might not have made... simply because he knew how to handle a knife.
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
I don't know.
How about you?
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting a little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I guess I'll have to break it up.
I change my vote to not guilty.
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.
What do you mean you've had enough? That's no answer!
Hey, listen. You just take care of yourself, huh? You know?
He's right. That's not an answer.
What kind of a man are you?
You have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else... because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket.
And now you've changed your vote because you say you're sick of all the talking here?
Now listen, buddy!
Who tells you that you have the right to play like this with a man's life?
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.
If you want to vote not guilty... then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty... not because you've had enough.
And if you think he is guilty, then vote that way.
Or don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?
Look, I don't have to -
You do have to! Say it! Why?
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.
I want another vote.
Okay. There's another vote called for.
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands. Anyone object?
Okay. All those voting not guilty, raise your hands.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... eight.
Um, nine.
Um, all those voting guilty, raise your hands.
One, two, three.
Well, the vote's nine to three in favor of acquittal.
I don't understand you people!
I mean, all these picky little points you keep bringing up.
They don't mean nothing! You saw this kid just like I did.
You're not gonna tell me you believe that phony story about losing the knife... and that business about being at the movies.
Look, you know how these people lie. It's born in them.
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.
They don't know what the truth is.
And let me tell you, they don't need any real big reason to kill someone either.
No, sir.
They get drunk! Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
You know that. And bang
- someone's lying in the gutter.
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.
You know what I mean? Violent!
Where are you going?
Î—uman life don't mean as much to them as it does to us.
Look! They're lushing it up and fighting all the time... and if somebody gets killed, so somebody gets killed!
They don't care!
Oh, sure, there's some good things about 'em too.
Look, I'm the first one to say that.
I've known a couple who were okay, but that's the exception, you know what I mean?
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings. They can do anything.
What's going on here?
I'm
- I'm trying to tell ya... you're making a big mistake, you people.
This kid is a liar! I know it. I know all about them.
Listen to me. They're no good.
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
I mean, what
- What's happening in here?
I'm speaking my piece, and you -
Listen to me.
I -
We're - This kid on trial here, his type -
Well, don't you know about them?
Th-There's - There's a danger here.
These people are dangerous.
They're... wild.
Listen to me.
- Listen.
- I have.
Now sit down and don't open your mouth again.
I was only trying to... tell you.
It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this.
Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.
I don't really know what the truth is.
I don't suppose anybody will ever really know.
Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent.
But we're just gambling on probabilities.
We may be wrong.
We may be trying to let a guilty man go free.
I don't know.
Nobody really can.
But we have a reasonable doubt... and that's something that's very valuable in our system.
No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.
We nine can't understand... how you three are still so sure.
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.
You've made some excellent points, but I still believe the boy is guilty of murder... and I have two reasons.
One, the evidence given by the woman across the street... who actually saw the murder committed.
As far as I'm concerned, that's the most important testimony.
And two, the fact that she described the stabbing by saying... she saw the boy raise his arm over his head and stab down into the father's chest.
She saw him do it the wrong way.
That's absolutely right.
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
She said she went to bed about 11:00 that night.
Her bed was next to the window, and she could look out while lying down... and see directly into the boy's room across the street.
She tossed and turned for over an hour, unable to sleep.
Finally, she turned toward the window at about 10 minutes after 12:00... and, as she looked out, she saw the killing through the windows of a passing el train.
She said the lights went out immediately after the killing... but that she got a good look at the boy in the act of stabbing his father.
As far as I can see it, this is unshakable testimony.
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?
How about you?
I
- I don't know.
So much evidence to sift.
This is a pretty complicated business.
Frankly, I don't see how you can vote for acquittal.
It's not so easy to arrange all the evidence in order.
You can throw out all the other evidence!
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?
- Yeah, well, maybe
- - Let's vote on it.
Okay. There's another vote called for.
Anybody object?
All right. I'm changing my vote. He's guilty.
Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.
Why is this such a personal triumph for you
- this one vote?
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.
Î—ow about it? I want to hear arguments.
You, you're the leader of the cause. What about it?
Let's go over it again.
We've been over it again!
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin' backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.
No point in getting nasty and trying to turn this into a contest.
Okay.
Maybe we can talk about setting some kind of time limit.
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?
It's a quarter after 6:00.
Someone before mentioned 7:00.
I think that's a point at which we might begin to discuss... the question of whether we're a hung jury or not.
Don't you feel well?
I feel perfectly well, thank you.
I was saying that 7:00 would be a reasonable time.
Uh, the reason I asked about that was because, uh... you were rubbing your nose like -
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting... but you made a gesture that reminded me of something.
I'm trying to settle something here. Do you mind?
Well, I think this is important.
Thank you.
Now then, I'm sure you'll pardon me for this... but I was wondering why you were rubbing your nose like that.
Oh, come on, will ya?
At this point, I happen to be talking to the gentleman sitting next to you!
Now, why were you rubbing your nose like that?
Well, if it's any of your business, I was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
Oh. I'm sorry.
- Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses? - It is.
Now can we get on to something else?
Your eyeglasses made those two deep impressions on the sides of your nose.
I hadn't noticed that before.
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I've never worn eyeglasses. Twenty-twenty.
Listen, will you come on already with the optometrist bit?
The woman who testified that she saw the killing... had those same marks on the sides of her nose.
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.
Please.
Just give me a minute, and I'll be finished.
I don't know if anyone else noticed that about her.
I didn't think of it then, but
I've been going over her face... in my mind.
She had those same marks.
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.
This woman was about, uh
- about 45 years old.
She was making a tremendous effort to look 35... for her first public appearance.
Heavy makeup, dyed hair... brand-new clothes that should have been worn by a younger woman.
No glasses.
No, women do that.
See if you can get the mental picture of it.
What do you mean, no glasses?
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.
So what? What do ya think that means?
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw them too.
I was the closest one to her. She had these, uh
- these things on the side of her nose.
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose. Well, what does that mean?
Could those marks be made by anything other than eyeglasses?
No, they couldn't.
I didn't see any marks!
I did.
Strange, but I didn't think about it before.
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?
There are 12 people in here concentrating on this case.
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?
Have her testify without her glasses?
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?
Okay. She had marks on her nose.
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house so people would think she's gorgeous.
But when she saw this kid killing his father, she was in the house alone.
That's all.
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
It's logical to assume that she wasn't wearing them when she was in bed... tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.
I'm also guessing that she probably didn't put her glasses on... when she turned to look casually out of the window.
And she herself testified the killing took place just as she looked out.
The lights went off a split second later. She couldn't have had time to put them on then.
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?
I only know the woman's eyesight is in question now.
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that.
Oh, don't give me that.
Don't you think the woman might have made a mistake?
- No.
- It's not possible?
No, it's not possible.
Is it possible?
Not guilty.
Do you think he's guilty?
I think he's guilty.
Do you?
No. I'm convinced.
Not guilty.
What's the matter with you?
I have a reasonable doubt now.
Eleven to one.
Well, what about all the other evidence? What about all that stuff?
The knife, the whole business!
Well, you said we could throw out all the other evidence.
Well, what do we do now?
You're alone.
I don't care whether I'm alone or not! It's my right.
It's your right.
Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.
We're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.
We have as much time as it takes.
Everything - Every single thing that took place in that courtroom - but I mean everything
- says he's guilty.
What do you think, I'm an idiot or something?
Why don't you take that stuff about the old man?
The old man who lived there and heard everything.
Or this business about the knife.
What? 'Cause he found another one exactly like it?
The old man saw him right there on the stairs!
What's the difference how many seconds it was?
Every single thing.
The knife falling through a hole in his pocket.
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.
Sure, you can take all the time, hobble around the room.
But you can't prove it!
And what about this business of the el and the movies?
There's a phony deal if I ever heard one.
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd remember the movies I saw.
I'm telling ya, everything that's gone on... has been twisted and turned!
This business with the glasses?
How do you know she didn't have them on? This woman testified in open court!
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?
I'm telling ya, I've got all the facts here.
Here. Ah -
Well, that's it! That's the whole case.
Well?
Say something!
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.
You're not gonna intimidate me.
I'm entitled to my opinion.
Rotten kids. You work your life out!
I can't keep -
No.
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
Not -
Um, we're ready now.
Hey!
What's your name?
Davis.
My name's McCardle.
Well, so long.
So long.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF
The water gives my child rashes.
WHERE CITIZENS
AND CITY HALL MEET
PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO SUBMIT
And it breeds mosquitoes.
YOUR COMPLAINTS
AND REQUESTS HERE
Can't you do something?
It would make a great playground if you filled it in.
Just a moment, please.
Sir, they've come to complain about open sewage.
Send them to Public Works.
Here’s our protagonist.
But what a bore it would be to describe his life now.
Why?
Because he's only killing time.
Ηe's never actually lived.
You can't call this living.
Miss Odagiri... how dare you, during business hours?
It's just so funny!
What is?
The "Liar's Club."
Someone sent it around.
Read it to us.
"So you've never taken a vacation?"
"That's right."
"Because City Hall can't run without you?"
"No, because everyone would realize
City Hall doesn't need me at all."
This isn't even worth watching.
He might as well be a corpse.
In fact, he's been dead for some 20 years now.
Before that, he had some life in him.
He even tried to do a little real work.
PROPOSAL FOR INCREASING
DEPARTMENTAL EFFICIENCY
SUBMITTED 11/7/1930
BY ΚANJI WATANABE
But there's nothing left of that Will or passion.
They've been completely worn down by the minutia of the bureaucratic machine and the meaningless busyness it breeds.
Busy... so terribly busy.
But in reality, he does nothing at all besides protecting his own position.
The best way to protect your place in this world is to do nothing at all.
But is this enough?
Is this really enough?
For him to start thinking seriously about this, his stomach will have to get a lot worse, and he'll have to rack up a lot more wasted time.
But any proposal for creating a park must go to the Parks Department.
This seems to be more a matter of sanitation.
Talk to your district health center.
See the Sanitation Department.
See Environmental Sanitation.
Preventive Sanitation.
Disease Control.
Lots of mosquitoes?
That's a job for Pest Control.
The problem is seeping waste, which means... it's a problem for the Sewage Department at City Hall.
That was originally a culvert.
That is, it had a road over it.
You'll need the okay of the Roads Department.
City Planning doesn't have a policy for such cases.
Go to Zoning.
The Fire Department objected to filling that cesspool.
They need it because water pressure is bad there.
Are you kidding?
What we need is water, not sewage that breeds mosquitoes and causes rashes.
Imagine cleaning that sewage out of our hoses!
If there were a kiddie pool there, that'd be great for us too.
What about your local school district?
They should have a Child Welfare section.
But this problem doesn't only affect children.
Rebuilding all the schools has exhausted our resources.
A problem this big should be handled by your city councilman.
Sure, I'll write an introduction to the deputy mayor.
Take my business card.
He'll see you right away.
Please have a seat.
Thank you for all your efforts.
There's really nothing we welcome more than folks like you who bring grievances like this directly to our attention.
It's precisely for people like you that we established our new Public Affairs section.
Don't hesitate to tell them all about it!
Show these nice folks to the Public Affairs desk.
You'll need to talk to Public Works. Desk 8.
How dare you!
Stop giving us the runaround!
Why did you even put up that sign?
So we'd waste our time?
We're not idlers like all of you!
We just want something done about that stinking cesspool!
We don't care if it's Public Works, Sanitation,
Public Health, or whoever!
That's for Public Affairs to sort out!
Fine!
We're done with you jerks!
All you do is laugh at us!
You call this democracy?
Let's go.
Please wait a moment.
I'm afraid our section chief is out today.
It would be best if you could put it in writing.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF
What do you think?
The section chief never takes time off.
Yeah. And he's been listless recently.
But what'll we do if he's out for a long time?
Exactly.
He wouldn't take a day off just for a cold.
And nothing moves here without his seal.
That's right.
I must say, it's a terrible shame.
One more month and he'd have set a record of 30 years without a single absence.
Some people are glad he isn't here.
Bureaucrats always wonder who'll take the boss's place if he steps out.
He's been taking a lot of medicine.
What for?
His stomach.
He used to slurp his noodles to the bottom, but lately he barely touches them.
Plain udon noodles in soup.
Yet another record.
I've never seen him eat anything else.
Assuming the worst, who'll replace him?
What's your rush?
A lot of guys have to die before it's your turn!
X-RAY ROOM
- Mr. Hiraoka!
- Yes.
Your stomach?
My stomach's bad too.
They say it's chronic.
These days I hardly feel alive unless my stomach hurts.
Mr. Κo Suzuki.
That man who just went in...
His doctor told him he has an ulcer, but I'm sure it's stomach cancer.
Has to be.
And stomach cancer is practically a death sentence.
The doc usually says it's just a mild ulcer and that there's no need to operate.
That you can eat whatever you want as long as it's easy to digest.
If that's what he tells you, you've got a year at most.
But with some symptoms, you won't even last a year: first... a dull, heavy pain.
Frequent unpleasant burping.
A dry tongue.
You can't seem to get enough water and tea.
And then there's the diarrhea.
And if it isn't diarrhea, it's constipation.
Your bowel movements turn black.
And then... the meat you used to love seems totally inedible.
Whatever you eat you throw up half an hour later.
And then you start throwing up food you ate a week before.
At that point, you've got three months at most...
Mr. Kanji Watanabe.
Mr. Kanji Watanabe.
Yes.
Have a seat.
Now, then... it looks like you have a mild ulcer.
Please... tell me... the honest truth.
- Tell me it's stomach cancer.
- No.
As I just said, it's a mild ulcer.
What about surgery?
Can't you operate?
No need for surgery.
It can be treated medically.
What about my diet?
Well, let's see.
Use common sense.
If it's easy to digest, you can eat whatever you like.
Has he got a year?
No, no more than six months.
- Six months?
- Yeah.
What would you do if you only had six months left to live?
Miss Aihara, what about you?
See the Veronal in the cabinet?
Is there a blackout?
The street lights are on, and the neighbors' lights.
Strange.
I wonder if Father is out.
- Where's the key?
- In your handbag.
Did Mrs. Hayashi leave it unlocked?
She's so irresponsible.
That's the problem with a part-time maid.
Having her live in wouldn't cost much, but a burglary sure would.
That's Dad's mentality.
Typical petty bureaucrat.
It's freezing.
Just as bad inside as out.
That's why I hate
Japanese houses.
It's such a drag coming home to this.
I'd like a modern house.
Honey... a house of our own would cost around 500,000 yen, right?
Could we use your dad's retirement bonus as collateral?
It must be worth
700,000 by now, plus a monthly pension of 13,000 yen... and another 100,000 in savings.
But you think he'd agree?
If he doesn't, we'll say we're moving out.
That'll clinch it.
Even Dad doesn't want to take that much money to the grave.
Dad, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Something's not right.
Listen...
- this is awful.
- What is?
He heard everything.
He's awful.
It may be his house, but this is our room.
I can't believe he snuck in here while we were out.
If he needed to talk to us, he should have said so.
He's too old to be sulking around.
Stop making that face.
Enough about your dad.
He has his life.
We have ours.
Hold me.
How sad.
She was so young.
And to leave such a sweet little boy behind.
She must have died filled with regret.
Would you stop?
You're like a broken record.
Hurry!
Mommy's getting away!
Whenever remarriage comes up, you always use the boy as an excuse.
When Mitsuo grows up, he won't care about you as much as you think.
And when he gets married, they'll push you aside.
You have to think about your own future.
I'm telling you:
Find a good wife now.
Even my old lady says so.
She imagines how filthy it must be with an oily-skinned man like you living as a widower.
Dad.
Mitsuo.
Good night.
Please lock the front door.
Mitsuo!
How about that?
Great hit, huh?
That batter is my...
Mitsuo...
Stupid idiot!
What was he thinking?
Mitsuo.
Mitsuo, be brave.
It's just your appendix.
It's no worse than pulling a tooth.
Can't you stay for the operation, Dad?
I've got... some other things to do.
Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai! Banzai!
Dad!
Mitsuo...
CERTIFICATE
OF COMMENDATION
FOR 25 YEARS
OF DISTINGUISHED CIVIL SERVICE
Mr. Watanabe left for work at his usual time.
What?
But nobody has seen him.
It's been five days now.
And he hasn't called in sick.
The subsection chief asked me to check in on him.
Ma'am.
What? Impossible!
But it's true.
The man from his office said so.
What could he be up to?
It seems unbelievable, but it's true.
The people at his house looked baffled.
That puts me in a fix.
Why? I can stamp any paperwork while he's out.
But he has to approve any resignations, right?
Why?
Are you looking to quit?
I don't belong here.
Uncle, he even withdrew
50,000 yen.
That miser?
I wonder if he's got a woman.
That would really be something.
- Now, dear.
- I'm sure it's not that.
There's no telling when it comes to love.
The ones you least expect are the most susceptible.
If you ask me, he's actually a real lecher.
A lecher with a solemn veneer.
But he's stayed widowed these 20 years for you.
It makes sense that he'd eventually snap, right?
Nonsense. He's lost a lot of weight recently, and his oily skin has gotten rough and dry.
There must be another explanation.
You saw him recently?
Four days ago.
He showed up in the morning.
I thought there was definitely something wrong.
But your uncle here blurted out,
"Why so glum? If you've come for a loan, forget it."
How could I suspect a love affair when he looked like that?
Hush! You see... my husband thinks all men are as debauched as he is.
Mitsuo, did anything happen at home?
Nothing in particular.
Hey.
Deliver this to my place.
A guy from the magazine is waiting there.
And get some cyclobarbital at the pharmacy.
Just give them my name.
But sir, the pharmacy's already closed.
Is it that late?
In this neighborhood folks go to bed after dinner.
That stinks.
I can't sleep unless
I chase it down with whisky.
Pardon me for butting in... but I happen to have some.
Much obliged.
May I pay you the official price?
No, no.
I was planning to throw it away.
- But...
- No, really.
Really?
Then let me pick up your tab.
Oh, no.
You can hold your liquor, right?
Drink up.
You hardly seem tipsy.
Thank you.
Even if I drink,
I'll just throw it up.
You see...
I have stomach cancer.
- Stomach cancer?
- Yes.
I don't know what to say.
In that case, what you're doing is crazy.
Yes, I'm ashamed to admit.
I mean... drinking when you have stomach cancer is suicide.
The thing is...
I can't go through with it.
"Go ahead and kill yourself,"
I think.
And yet...
I just can't do it.
I mean...
I can't bring myself to make it final.
But what have I been... living for all these years?
You don't have children?
Does your stomach hurt?
No, it's not my stomach.
There seems to be a deeper issue here.
No.
It's just... that I've been such a fool.
I'm just... so mad at myself.
Until just a few days ago...
I had never even bought myself a drink.
It's only now that I don't know how much longer
I have to live... that I've finally begun...
I understand.
I understand.
But drinking now is plain crazy.
Besides, does it even taste good?
No, it doesn't.
But for a little while
I can forget my cancer and all the other painful things.
This... this expensive sake... is like drinking poison... to get back at myself.
I mean... that is... it's kind of... a painful feeling...
I understand.
Sorry to be telling you all this.
Listen...
I have 50,000 yen on me that I'd like to spend all at once.
But I'm ashamed to admit that I'm not even sure how to go about it.
What I'm trying to say is...
You want me to show you how to spend it?
Yes.
I realize it's terribly forward of me.
But...
This money...
It took me decades to save up this money.
All the more reason now to...
I understand.
But please put your money away.
Tonight's on me.
But that's not...
Just leave things to me.
It's fascinating.
I realize it's rude to call you fascinating, but you're an extremely rare individual.
I'm just a slacker who writes second-rate fiction.
You've really started me thinking.
They say there's something noble about suffering, and it's true.
Misfortune teaches us the truth.
Your cancer has opened your eyes to your own life.
People are fickle and shallow.
We only realize how beautiful life is when we face death.
And even then, few of us realize it.
The worst among us know nothing of life until they die.
You're amazing! Rebelling against your past self at this age!
That rebellious spirit moves me.
You were a slave to your own life.
Now you'll become its master.
It's our human duty to enjoy life.
Wasting it is desecrating
God's great gift.
We have to be greedy for life.
They say greed is a vice, but that's outdated.
Greed is a virtue, especially greed for enjoying life.
Come on.
Let's go reclaim the life you've wasted.
Tonight it will be my pleasure to act as your Mephistopheles, but a beneficent one who won't ask for your soul.
How perfect!
There's even a black dog.
Lead the way!
Listen.
These silver balls are you.
They're your life itself.
People strangle themselves in their daily lives.
This machine sets them free.
It's a vending machine for dreams and aspirations.
No, don't!
You wouldn't know it, but these women are the greediest of all mammals.
It'll cost you a dozen hats to get that old one back.
Besides, you're a new man now.
Time to buy a new hat!
Welcome.
Welcome.
It's been a long time!
The same for your friend?
What are you laughing at?
It's the honest truth.
He really does have cancer.
- Then why's he drinking?
- Idiot!
That's why you'll never understand.
Εcce homo.
"Behold the man."
This man bears a cross called cancer.
He's Christ.
If you were diagnosed with cancer, you'd start dying right away.
But not this fellow.
That's when he started living.
Isn't that right?
Hey, don't stare like that.
It's rude.
This way.
Anyone want to request a favorite?
"Life is Brief."
What?
"Life is Brief."
Fall in love, maidens
That love song from the nineteen teens? Okay!
Life is brief
Fall in love, maidens
Before the crimson bloom
Fades from your lips
Before the tides of passion
Cool within you
For those of you
Who know no tomorrow
Life is brief
Fall in love, maidens
Before the raven tresses
Begin to fade
Before the flames in your hearts
Flicker and die
For those to whom
Today will never return
That's it!
That's the spirit!
Life is brief
Striptease.
It isn't... an art.
It's more than art.
It's more direct.
That female body gently undulating up there is a juicy steak, a glass of liquor, an injection of camphor, testosterone, streptomycin, uranium...
Stop, please.
Hey, stop the car.
Wha... do we have a flat?
I think he's throwing up.
Let's sing something.
I hate feeling blue.
Section Chief!
I thought it was you!
I hardly recognized you in that new hat.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I was looking for your place.
Are you off to work?
No, I'm...
Do you have your seal?
No, it's back at home.
I want to quit City Hall.
I'm in a rush.
I've found a new job.
Then... come to my house.
- Why are you quitting?
- I'm bored.
It's killing me.
Every day is like the one before.
Nothing new ever happens.
I've put up with it for a year and half, but the only novel thing that's happened was that you took five days off... and now this new hat of yours.
That's it.
Listen, don't say anything when Dad gets back.
I have nothing to say.
I'm saying don't take that carping attitude.
If you hadn't brought up his retirement bonus...
How self-serving, blaming it all on me!
You're the one who brought up his savings and how even he wouldn't take it all to the grave.
But I still can't figure out why that was enough to make him act like this.
He's never once stayed out all night.
Let's drop it.
We have no idea what he's doing, much less whether it's our fault.
I'll wait here.
Please come in for a bit.
Honey!
Thirty years.
It kills me to think of 30 years in that place.
I'm sorry.
No, it's just that... recently... every time
I see that award, it reminds me of that joke you read to us.
I mean, it really rang true.
All these 30 years... what have I been doing there?
I can't remember no matter how I try.
All I remember... is just being busy... and even then I was bored.
I had you all wrong, sir.
You really do understand!
What a surprise!
That's crazy.
Whatever Uncle says,
I know Dad best.
But...
It's unimaginable,
Dad with such a young girl.
It's not in the right format.
Are you going to the office?
Yes, I have to submit this.
Could you turn in my sick-leave form?
Why are you taking so much time off?
Everyone's talking about it.
They're calling it your "mutation."
I just...
Are you really sick?
You do look kind of pale.
I just meant...
I didn't think so.
So where do you go when you pretend you're going to work?
Don't try to hide it.
But don't you know that Mr. Sakai came here yesterday and told them everything?
Who cares, right?
After 30 years without an absence, you deserve at least six months off.
Besides, I'll cover for you.
- I'm not like Carp Windsock.
- Carp Windsock?
Yes, Mr. Sakai is a human carp windsock.
His lips are always flapping, but he's just hot air inside.
Plus he always acts like such a big shot.
He makes 200 yen more a month than I do, so he looks down on me.
Bye, then.
Listen, I'll go with you.
Ma'am?
Ma'am!
You're so lucky.
I wish I could live in a house like yours.
At our place, three families share two rooms.
It's like the Warring States period.
And you have a wonderful son, right?
Tell me, where do they sell women's stockings?
You want to buy some?
Western clothing stores carry them.
For your daughter-in-law, right?
I've heard she's very pretty.
That's according to Carp Windsock's report.
- Are you all right?
- I'm just so excited!
- They make you that...
- I'm so happy!
To buy them myself,
I'd have to have sardines for lunch for three months.
But why did you buy them for me?
Well, yours had holes in them.
Do the holes in my stockings make your feet cold?
Don't get me wrong...
I was just kidding.
I know you did it out of kindness, but I feel awkward at times like this.
That's why I made a bad joke.
Forgive me.
Want to hear something good?
Something good?
I got so bored that I gave everyone at work nicknames.
Wanna hear them?
- Sea Slug.
- Sea Slug?
Can you guess?
Someone who's slippery and evasive.
Mr. Ono, the subsection chief.
Sea Slug...
Gutter Cover. Someone who's damp and gloomy all year round.
- Would that be Obara?
- Bingo!
Next: Flypaper.
- Flypaper?
- You know... sticks to everything.
You guessed, right?
Mr. Noguchi!
Next is the floor supervisor,
Mr. Saito.
Can you guess his nickname?
Mr. Saito.
Let's see...
His distinguishing feature is that he has none.
I don't really know...
Set Menu.
- Set Menu?
- At the cafeteria.
And what about Κimura?
Jelly Noodles.
Timid and quivering.
I had a nickname for you too.
But I'm not going to tell,
'cause I had you all wrong.
No, I don't mind.
Tell me.
Now I've put my foot in it.
No, it would be worse if you didn't tell me.
Okay, then:
The Mummy.
Forgive me.
It's all right.
So you mean I'm...
I'll say good-bye here.
Thank you so much.
Do you really have to submit your resignation today?
If you could make it tomorrow, we could spend today...
You're not eating anything.
It's just...
You look so tired.
No, today was really a lot of fun.
But you snored through the best part of the movie.
It's just that...
I overdid it a bit last night.
Mr. Κimura...
This is something...
I can't tell anyone.
It's too embarrassing.
You see, the reason...
I've worked... like a mummy these last 30 years...
Oh, no!
It's not that I mind you calling me a mummy... because that's exactly right.
I don't blame you at all.
It's just that the reason
I turned myself into a mummy...
What I mean is that I did it all... for my son's sake.
But as it turns out, my son... couldn't care in the least.
But you can't blame it all on your son.
Isn't that right?
Not unless he asked you to become a mummy.
Parents are all the same.
My mom gives me the same line sometimes.
"All the trouble you've put me through!"
I'm grateful she had me, but babies don't ask to be born.
But what happened to make you bad-mouth your son to me?
It's just...
I knew it!
You still adore him!
No end in sight for the electricity shortage.
Is that right?
This heat is due to the warmest ocean currents in 30 years.
Is that a fact?
Actually, there's something...
I'd like to tell you.
I know I should have told you sooner, but it's not very pleasant business.
Father, I already know.
You see, I discussed it with Uncle today.
We must address practical matters to avoid complications later.
For instance, although we have rights as your heirs, you need to make those clear to avoid disputes.
She's taken you for 50,000 yen in just a few days.
- Young girls these days...
- What are you...?
Father! We respect your free will, all right?
We even accept your debauchery!
But it's common sense to set some conditions.
Think of Κazue, or at least of her family back home.
How dare you bring home a woman like that!
And holding hands with her in your room!
I could hardly face Mrs. Hayashi when she told me!
Two weeks have passed since our protagonist abandoned his post.
During that time, various rumors and speculations about Mr. Watanabe have made the rounds.
The rumors and speculation all agree on one thing:
Whatever Mr. Watanabe is doing, it is very frivolous indeed.
But in point of fact,
Watanabe had never been this earnest about anything in his entire life.
This isn't City Hall, where you can waste a whole day on an hour's work!
I just...
Every second I waste here costs me money.
Then what about tonight?
I'm pooped at night.
I'd rather sleep than go out.
Besides, why are you always taking me out?
It's just...
Let's stop doing this.
It doesn't feel right.
Just one last time tonight.
No, or it'll never end!
Now, excuse me.
Tonight's the last time, okay?
Shall we go for a stroll?
I've had enough.
Next it'll be a sweets shop, then a sushi or noodle joint.
What's the point of these endless rounds?
I feel bad saying this when you pay for everything, but I've had enough.
We've run out of things to talk about.
There's that face again.
The truth is you give me the creeps.
What's going on? Why do you chase me around like this?
- It's just...
- It's just what?
It's just...
I enjoy spending time with you this way.
A May-December romance?
Forget it.
No, no!
It's just that I...
Just spit it out instead of sputtering like that.
- Are you mad?
- No.
I don't even know myself... why I keep following you around.
All I know is...
Listen:
I'm going to die soon.
I've got stomach cancer.
It's right here.
Do you see?
No matter how I struggle,
I've only got six months to a year left.
When I found out,
I suddenly... in here...
Now I remember:
I nearly drowned in a pond once when I was a child.
I felt exactly the same way then.
Everything's going black.
I writhe and thrash around, but there's nothing to hold on to...
- except you.
- What about your son?
Don't talk to me about him!
I have no son.
- I'm all alone.
- But...
No, you don't understand.
My son is somewhere far away.
Just as my mom and pop were when I was drowning in that pond.
Remembering it now, it's even more painful than it was then.
But why someone like me?
It's just that... when I look at you,
I get a warm feeling... right here.
Even an old mummy like me.
What I mean is, you've been really kind to me.
No, that's not it.
You're young and healthy, and that's why...
No.
I mean... what makes you so lively?
You're just so full of life.
That's why I...
That's why this mummy envies you!
Before I die, even if only for one day,
I want to be like that.
Until I've done that,
I can't let myself die.
You see, I just...
I just want something to...
I want to do something.
I just don't know what.
But you know.
No, maybe you don't, but...
But I don't!
Tell me, how can I be like you?
- But all I do is work and eat!
- What else?
That's all!
It's true.
All I do is make these little things.
Just making these is so much fun.
I feel like I'm making friends with every baby in Japan.
Why don't you try making something too?
What could I possibly make at that office?
Yeah, it's hopeless there.
You should quit and go somewhere...
It's too late.
No... it's not too late.
It's not hopeless.
Even there, there's something I can do.
I just have to find the will.
There's something I can do.
It's only a matter of time before he resigns.
His son came by yesterday about his retirement bonus.
Which means you'll finally be section chief.
Well, you never know.
Good morning.
Section Chief.
Ono, take care of this.
PETITION TO REPAIR
AND FILL IN CULVERT
ΚUROE WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION
TO BE ASSIGNED
TO PUBLIC WORΚS
Is this really a job for Public Works?
Actually, this is precisely the kind of job that Public Affairs should oversee.
Public Works can't do it alone.
Parks and Sewage must also take action.
Get me a car, will you?
I'm going out to survey the site.
Put together a report today.
Sir, I'm not sure that's possible.
It is if you set your mind to it.
Five months later.
The protagonist of our story has died.
Let us see the deputy mayor.
He must be here.
Just five minutes, please.
Reporters.
What should I tell them?
- Your suspicions are groundless.
- Are they?
Our claim is based on thorough research.
Sir, the official story is that the Parks Department and local councilman built that park with your backing, but wasn't it really
Mr. Watanabe?
That's the word.
Mr. Watanabe was chief of Public Affairs.
Building parks is the Park Department's job.
We understand that.
But the plan almost fizzled out several times.
We're talking about the man who saw it to completion.
Local residents believe that that was Mr. Watanabe.
They're deeply concerned about the fact that he died in the park he built.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, they were suspicious even before that happened.
For example, in your speech at the park's opening ceremony, you never mentioned
Mr. Watanabe once.
They say it wasn't a congratulatory address.
Then what was it?
A campaign speech.
Furthermore... he was completely ignored during the ceremony and seated in the back corner.
In short, people feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
So the fact that he died in the park has led to some interesting speculation.
It's seen as an act of silent protest against top city officials.
So you're saying
Watanabe committed suicide or at least let himself freeze to death?
More or less.
I see.
Don't forget it was also snowing last night.
Sounds like a scene right out of a play.
However... an autopsy has clearly established the cause of Watanabe's death.
He certainly didn't commit suicide.
Nor did he freeze to death.
- He died of stomach cancer.
- Stomach cancer?
That's right.
Internal hemorrhaging.
Watanabe died suddenly, without warning.
If you have any doubts...
Ono, give them the name of the hospital.
It's just not right.
The way these reporters think, and their tactlessness...
Actually... it applies to the general public too.
They just don't understand how government works.
They're woefully ignorant of how we function.
Take that little park in Κuroe.
Some seem to believe that Watanabe built it, but that's ridiculous.
Maybe I shouldn't say this here at his wake, in front of his son and relatives... but I'll go ahead, because I think Watanabe would agree with me.
Certainly, Watanabe went to great pains to get that park built.
I take my hat off to his enthusiasm.
But his efforts were part of his official duties.
The idea he went beyond the scope of his office to facilitate citizens' desires and actually built the park himself is nonsense to those who understand our bureaucracy.
Watanabe himself would grimace at the idea.
However... we may be partly to blame for the fact people are saying such things.
All eyes were on that epoch-making project as it was rushed to completion.
Maybe we should have singled out someone's service.
For instance... the chief of the Parks Department.
Or his superior... the chief of Public Works.
If you say so,
Mr. Deputy Mayor, but here's what I think.
The head of the Parks Department and I only fulfilled the duties of our offices.
But when I think how difficult it was to navigate the intricate politics of the city council and realize the park's construction, it is you, Deputy Mayor, who should be singled out.
Now, now...
Some people have even criticized my speech at the opening ceremony.
Isn't that right, Ono?
They called it a campaign speech!
Excuse me.
The residents of Κuroe are here asking to burn incense for the deceased.
Κiichi, come.
You too, Mitsuo.
It sure is cold.
May I pour one for you?
I'll get some warm sake.
What do you say?
Why don't you all move closer down here?
Why not?
- Over here, please.
- Thanks.
Mr. Hayashi.
Mr. Ono.
Did all the big shots go off to a meeting?
Yes.
No, they just couldn't stand to stay here.
I don't care what anyone says.
It was Mr. Watanabe who built that park.
The deputy mayor and his people know it.
That's going too far.
As the deputy mayor said...
That's right.
I'm not saying this because
I'm in the Parks Department, but we drew up the plans and oversaw construction.
- That's not what I meant.
- Now, now...
I understand how you feel, but...
The point is he was in Public Affairs.
Did he think he could just build a park?
We have to respect each other's turf or...
If I had to say how that park got built,
I'd say it was coincidence.
Hear me out.
If a looming election hadn't put pressure on the local councilman, and if profiteers hadn't lobbied to build a red-light district there, that reclamation work wouldn't have proceeded so quickly.
That's right.
Exactly right.
There's one thing
I can't figure out.
Why would someone like him suddenly change like that?
What could it have been?
I agree.
It's a complete mystery.
It really is.
I mean... with the benefit of hindsight, it would seem he knew he had stomach cancer, and that's why...
We were just discussing whether your father knew he had stomach cancer.
Well, I think he would have told me if he did.
Indeed.
I believe my father was fortunate to die without realizing he had cancer.
A diagnosis like that is a death sentence.
I see.
Well, that rules out
Saito's theory.
What theory is that?
Well, five months ago he went through a sudden transformation.
That's for sure.
And none of us has any clue what caused it.
Well, that was a woman's doing.
With a young mistress, the hormonal effect can temporarily rejuvenate an old man.
Happens all the time.
It suddenly put a sheen back on his cheeks.
Actually... we heard rumors at that time of a romance.
That explains the rakish hat.
Sure does.
That surprised the hell out of me.
Sir, I'm not sure that's possible.
It is if you set your mind to it.
But wait.
In any case, his enthusiasm was a bit over the top.
Yes. That's very true.
I don't mean to argue, but a woman alone can't account for...
- But...
- Dear.
The thing is... it just doesn't make sense.
Not to change the subject, but there were times when his extraordinary zeal threatened to derail it all.
That's city hall for you.
Gotta guard your turf.
That's right.
The biggest mystery to me is how a 30-year veteran could suddenly forget the rules.
It's because he...
In any event... pushing his plan on all the other departments ensured that everyone would dig in their heels.
My boss was none too happy about it.
Building parks is the Parks Department's job.
We have our own proposals for new parks.
Couldn't you reconsider?
This site is really terrible.
But building a park isn't as simple as you outline in your proposal.
No, this proposal is just...
I understand.
Tell you what:
I'll study your proposal thoroughly.
But you know, in the end even the parks chief caved in to Watanabe's tenacity...
You've got a point there.
He really didn't know what to do.
He really was something.
He would wait days for the answer he wanted.
Our section chief would sneak away the second he saw Watanabe's face.
That's right.
Section Chief!
He even pleaded with underlings like me.
It was unbelievable!
Won't you please...?
Isn't there some way...?
Finally we couldn't stand by any longer.
That's right.
We took pity on him too.
But you guys in General Affairs were the worst of all.
Wait a minute!
I went around with him, so I know.
You made us beg for two weeks.
I won't forget that.
Sorry about that.
However... remember the most surprising thing?
- Oh, right.
- That was a shocker.
DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE
But you know what was even more surprising?
The incident in the deputy mayor's office?
- I heard about that!
- That was something!
A section chief openly defying the deputy mayor... unprecedented at City Hall!
Listen, about that new park... it's one thing to show initiative, but you don't want people thinking you're a publicity hound.
And the city council's got problems of its own.
I think it's best just to let the proposal die.
Last night there was a banquet at Nakagawa.
I tell you, geisha these days are appalling.
One of them spent the evening sulking and didn't say a word.
The proprietress said she was a student working part-time!
That's a good one!
Couldn't you please... reconsider the proposal?
What did you just say?
I mean... about that park... won't you reconsider your decision?
But the thing is, when you look at the results, was it worth taking it that far?
No, it was crazy!
Everyone at City Hall is guarding his own turf.
But didn't the deputy mayor end up reconsidering?
That's because the councilman needled him.
It was just coincidence.
You're attributing everything to Watanabe's "zeal."
Don't be so sentimental!
Sentimental!
Is that so?
I don't see it that way.
If all of you can't understand his dedication, the world's a dark place indeed.
It is a dark place.
From just looking at Mr. Watanabe you could tell that only his work was keeping him alive.
Didn't it look that way to you?
Sometimes it even gave me chills.
When was it?
I was...
That reminds me of when I'd see him at the construction site.
That look in his eyes!
As if he were watching his child or grandchild, the apple of his eye.
Of course.
He nurtured that park like you would a child.
So what are you saying?
Like I said before:
Whatever anyone says,
Mr. Watanabe built that park...
But if the councilman and deputy mayor hadn't been facing reelection, the plan wouldn't have become a reality.
Watanabe had no role in what was going on higher up.
That's not actually true.
Really?
The folks who wanted that red-light district definitely thought Watanabe was blocking their way. Listen to this:
Section Chief.
Are you Section Chief of Public Affairs?
Yes.
Just the man
I wanted to see.
Old man, you'd better mind your own business.
Just what are you trying to...
Don't play dumb!
No hard feelings.
Just shut up and back off.
Say something!
You value your life?
This is Watanabe.
I just don't get it.
Why would someone like him...
I just don't... get it.
No, I'm sure Mr. Watanabe knew he had stomach cancer.
But...
I just suddenly remembered something.
This is too much!
We've been at this for two weeks.
We've explained it to them 20 times.
They could at least tell us if there are funds.
General Affairs is just being sadistic.
It's not like it's their personal money.
Why can't they be more agreeable?
Well, you know...
Doesn't it make you furious to be treated with such contempt?
No.
I can't afford to hate people.
I haven't got that kind of time.
You mean...
Wait!
Now that you mention it... that reminds me... of something.
How beautiful!
Truly beautiful.
A sunset.
I don't think I've really looked at one in 30 years.
But I haven't got time for this now.
He knew!
He knew he didn't have long left to live...
It makes everything clear as day.
There's no other explanation.
That explains his extraordinary passion and his strange behavior.
Now what he did makes perfect sense!
Absolutely.
We'd have done the same.
But any of us could die at any moment.
Listen...
Subsection Chief.
I mean you... the new Section Chief of Public Affairs.
Section Chief!
Are you listening?
I haven't been promoted yet.
See here!
- Ono!
- Cut it out.
What did you say a minute ago?
"We'd have done the same."
Don't make me laugh.
Hey, that's enough now.
You think you could have done what Mr. Watanabe did?
Don't make me laugh.
Listen, Ohara... the thing is...
I may look dumb, but...
Don't you think...
Okay, I only went to night school...
- so I'll never make section chief!
- Watanabe was a great man!
No, great's not the right word.
- But you, Ono?
- What's the right word?
- Don't make me laugh.
- Compared to him...
Compared to Mr. Watanabe, the rest of us...
We're worthless scum!
Including you!
That's going too far.
We may be scum... but some of us start out at City Hall as good people.
But the longer you stay...
I didn't used to be...
You're not supposed to do anything at City Hall.
Doing anything is considered radical!
We have to act like we're doing something while doing nothing.
- That's right.
- In our department too!
The thing is, just to get a garbage can somewhere emptied out, you need enough paperwork to fill another garbage can.
That's exactly right!
Seal after seal after seal!
That's just an excuse.
We waste people's valuable time.
The public is upset by bribes and 40,000 cars and so on, but those are just farts next to this invisible, colossal waste of time!
Listen here.
I often have the same concerns.
But in that labyrinthine machine, you can't do a thing!
All that meaningless busywork and not a moment to think!
Idiots!
But the thing is,
Mr. Ohara, even within a system where you can't get a thing done, and battling stomach cancer at that,
Mr. Watanabe managed to accomplish so much.
That's it!
That's what I wanted to say!
That's why I get so angry!
That's what I'm saying!
Mr. Watanabe expected no reward!
That's right!
When you imagine how he must have felt, his life on the line...
Anyone who tries to take the credit isn't human!
The deputy mayor.
Just say it!
That's going too far...
Listen.
How do you think he felt... dying all alone in that park?
Just thinking about it...
A policeman brought this by.
He found it in the park.
And he'd like to light incense for the deceased.
Thank you for taking the trouble.
Come in.
Won't you stay a bit and have a drink?
We appreciate your coming out of your way.
Please sit down.
To tell you the truth... last night I was... on patrol... in the new park... when I came across him.
It was 10:00... no.
Nearly 11:00.
He was on the swing... even though it was snowing.
I just assumed he was some drunk.
I was derelict in my duty.
If I'd followed my first inclination and taken him in, this wouldn't have happened.
What I did was unforgivable.
But he seemed to be... so perfectly happy.
I can't explain it.
He poured his whole heart into that song of his... with a haunting voice... that filled... the depths of my soul.
Life is brief
Fall in love, maidens
Before the crimson bloom
Fades from your lips
Before the tides of passion
Cool within you
For those of you
Who know no tomorrow
Listen, last night... under the stairs,
I found a pouch with my name on it.
Inside were
Dad's bankbook and seal, along with forms for claiming his retirement bonus.
So he left it before he went to the park?
It was so cruel of him... not to tell us he had cancer.
If I'd known sooner...
Hey, why didn't his girlfriend show up?
I wonder if she really was his girlfriend after all.
I'll do my best!
- I swear it!
- We must carry on his work!
We can't let his death be in vain!
I'll be like a man reborn!
We'll sacrifice ourselves in the service of the people!
Never forget this feeling!
I'm going to do my best!

In the 16th century, during the Civil Wars, an endless cycle of conflict left the countryside overrun by bandits.
Peaceful peasants lived in terror of the thunder of approaching hooves...
Take this village too?
Take it! Take it!
Not so fast!
We just took their rice last fall.
They'll have nothing now.
Very well.
We'll return when that barley's ripe!
Is there no god to protect us?
Land tax, forced labor, war, drought... and now bandits!
The gods want us farmers dead!
That's right!
We're better off dead!
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.
The magistrate can do more than collect taxes.
We can ask him for help.
We know all about him!
He shows up after they're gone, acting big while he surveys the damage.
That's right. He's useless.
We might as well hand over our rice and barley to the bandits and just hang ourselves!
That'll bring the magistrate here in a hurry!
We'll kill those bandits.
We'll kill them all.
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!
Not me!
I couldn't possibly --
That's crazy talk.
So we can kill defeated samurai but not bandits?
Stop it! This is no time to fight amongst ourselves.
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?
They'll slaughter us all, down to the last unborn child.
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!
Rikichi!
The farmer's only choice is to endure.
We can't defy the powerful.
When the bandits arrive, we'll greet them meekly and quietly hand over all our barley.
We'll plead with them to leave just enough for us to survive.
"That's all we ask," we'll beg on our hands and knees.
What bandit will agree to that?
Have you forgotten how low we had to stoop for the rice we're eating now?
We should go see the Old Man.
Let him decide what to do.
Consider who we're dealing with here. 
Give a wolf a taste of your leg and he'll ask for your hand. 
Once they have a taste, they'll be back in the fall. 
- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!
Without our barley, we're doomed anyway!
We fight.
Old Man, that's madness.
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?
We'll hire samurai.
Whoever heard of farmers hiring samurai?
I saw it with my own eyes, when the village you were born in was torched.
I saw it when we escaped to this village here.
The only village that didn't burn was the one that hired samurai.
But Old Man, there are different kinds of villages and villagers.
How are we to feed samurai when we live on rice gruel?
We'll make do on millet!
Show me a samurai who'll fight for farmers in return for food!
They're a proud lot.
Look.
Find hungry samurai.
Even bears come down from the mountains when they're hungry.
How dare you?
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!
I don't need your charity!
Fool!
What'd I tell you?
Look, the barley's ripe.
Ten days already since we left the village.
What do we do?
This barley's early, not like our mountain barley.
Hey, we're soaked through to the bone.
Find any cheap, strong and foolhardy samurai?
Leftovers.
You can have 'em cheap.
That's a laugh!
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.
- What about you, then?
- Not me.
I'd rather eat horseshit.
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.
Pulled his sword when he lost, so the three of us beat him up.
Not a drop left in his nose now.
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.
Is that true?
You can't live like that.
Without nourishment you'll go night-blind.
I've got just four left.
I'll trade 'em all for a cup of rice.
What do you say?
Damn! What a bunch.
What a waste.
If we still had that rice, we coulda bought 40 of those.
Shut up!
But it's true, right?
The blockhead's cracking up!
What a show.
Go at it, boys.
Who ever heard of anything so unfair?
We give him his fill of rice and a free bottle of sake, and he thanks us with a beating.
Good for him!
Not like this one playing possum here.
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.
Look at him sobbing.
Misses his wifey.
I'd pay good money to watch the two of 'em going at it.
Let's hurry and get back to the village.
Go on home. You can't afford buns, let alone samurai.
Farmers like us know good from bad when it comes to seed, but not when it comes to samurai.
Besides, we're no match for the tough ones, and the only ones interested are weaklings.
If I lost last night, it was only because I was starving.
Liar! You had plenty of money to gamble.
Jerk!
Wanna fight?
It's a fight.
Over here!
Wake up!
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.
Rikichi!
Stop it, Manzo!
You said we were going home, you son of a bitch!
I said we'd go home, not bargain with bandits!
If we can't hire samurai, what's left?
It's bargain or nothing!
Fine, have it your way!
But tell me:
If we do strike a bargain, what have we got to offer this year?
Are you willing to give 'em your daughter?
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.
What's going on?
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.
How many thieves are there?
Just one.
One?
All of you can't take a single thief?
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.
Says he'll kill him if we attack.
Listen. Hear him?
Poor thing.
It all happened in the middle of the night.
Poor kid's been bawling the better part of a day.
He can barely make a sound now.
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.
Who's that samurai getting his head shaved?
No idea. We asked him for help and he agreed right away.
Then he asked us for two rice balls.
He asked a monk to shave his head and lend him his robes.
No idea what he's up to.
Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!
I'm a monk.
Stay back!
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.
I won't come in.
I just thought the child must be very hungry.
I've brought some rice balls.
You should eat one yourself.
Won't you have one?
What's wrong?
Throw 'em here!
Here.
My baby!
Even you can't object to a samurai like that.
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.
What do you want?
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!
Disciple?
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.
I don't take on disciples.
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.
I'm begging you -- let me be your disciple.
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.
I'm at a loss.
You think far too highly of me.
No, sir --
Just hear me out.
There's nothing special about me.
I may have seen my share of battle, but always on the losing side.
That about sums me up.
Better not to follow such an unlucky man.
No, I'm determined to follow you whether you allow me to or not.
I forbid it.
I don't have the means to travel with an attendant.
Can I help you?
What do you want?
Insolence!
Stay out of this, little chick.
Are you a samurai?
Damn right I am!
I wonder.
Bastard.
Who was that?
Leave him be.
I beg of you, sir!
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.
It will never work.
Sir, we could arm the villagers with bamboo spears.
- I thought of that.
- But, sir --
This isn't a game.
They may be bandits, but they ride 40 strong.
Two or three samurai won't suffice.
Defense is more difficult than offense.
You say there are mountains behind the village?
Yes.
Passable by horse?
Yes.
Fields in front.
Until those are flooded with water, you're open to mounted attack on four sides.
You need at least four men, one to guard each side.
Two more to guard the rear.
No matter how frugal our estimate, we need seven, including me.
We can manage seven somehow.
But the Old Man said four.
It's only three more.
Hold on a second.
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.
First of all, it's not easy to find trustworthy samurai.
What's more, all you have to offer is food.
Only those out to fight for the hell of it will agree.
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.
Age, I suppose.
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.
Go ahead -- hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!
Silence, you lout!
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.
What truth? What the hell do you know of these farmers' suffering?
Don't make me laugh!
Like you would know.
How dare you?
You heard right. If you know, why don't you help them?
So you wanna fight?
That's enough.
Enough!
Hey, samurai, look at this.
This here's your dinner.
But what do you think these blockheads eat?
Millet.
They eat millet to feed you white rice.
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?
- All right, then.
- What?
Quit your jabbering.
I won't let this rice go to waste.
Manzo and the others are back!
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.
The samurai are coming?
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.
Seven?
Seven.
I was against it because you said four, Old Man.
I figured we'd need at least ten.
But if I'd said ten, we'd have ended up with 15.
That's the way it goes.
Old Man, I'm worried.
The village girls will go crazy over the samurai.
If the samurai touch 'em, all hell will break loose.
Bandits are coming, you fool.
Your head is on the block, and all you think of are your whiskers?
Samurai, sir.
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.
Who's to be my opponent?
Katsushiro. 
Hide just inside the door.
Strike that ronin as he enters.
Here he comes.
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.
Excellent!
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.
We're seeking expert swordsmen and have no time to waste.
Forgive me.
What's this about?
The reason better be good, or I'll have to redeem my honor.
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.
We must soon contend with a gang of bandits.
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?
It pains me to tell you, but we're fighting for farmers.
- Farmers?
- That's right.
This job affords no stipend and no reward.
But we can eat our fill as long as we fight.
This is absurd!
My ambitions are greater than that.
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?
I will not.
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.
What's wrong?
That one samurai's good, but how'll the other six be?
Enough of your worrying.
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.
That one there. 
Excuse me, samurai, sir.
Just like last time?
Sure.
It's good practice for you.
Surely you jest.
No offense intended.
I'm with you.
But I have to say that although I understand the farmers' suffering and understand why you would take up their cause, it's your character that I find most compelling.
In life one finds friends in the strangest places.
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.
A name fit for a giant, no?
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.
Yohei!
What's wrong?
Someone stole the rice.
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?
I was so careful.
I slept the whole night hugging that rice jar.
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!
But what'll we do till you get back?
There's only a handful left.
Stop that, you idiot!
Hide that money.
The master's returning.
I ran into you at just the right time.
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.
Now tell me, what happened after that?
I hid among the grasses in the moat until dark.
When the outer walls tumbled down on me in flames, I knew I was finished.
What ran through your mind at that moment?
Nothing special.
Sick of fighting yet?
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead leading to neither money nor rank.
Will you join us?
- Yes.
This may be the one that kills us.
Where are they when you need 'em?
What do you need, sir?
Samurai.
There's a pretty poor excuse for one in my backyard.
I couldn't believe his gumption.
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.
I'm broke, though, so I'll pay you by chopping wood."
I like his frankness.
Never seen a man split wood before?
Sure, but you do it with such relish.
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.
You're very good.
It's nothing compared to how I cut down men.
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.
There's no cutting me off when I start cutting.
So I make it a point to run away first.
A most excellent approach.
Why, thank you kindly.
Tell me, do you feel like cutting down 30 bandits?
Let us commence!
Too bad.
It's a draw.
I'm afraid not.
I won.
That's ridiculous!
If these were steel, you'd be dead now.
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.
What?
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.
It's a waste of your life.
Wait! Don't try to flee.
Draw! This isn't a contest of words!
This is preposterous.
There's no contest.
How did you fare?
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.
They say the fish that gets away looks bigger than it really is.
No.
I watched him cut a man down with my own eyes.
It was amazing.
A man obsessed only with testing the limits of his skill.
I doubt he'll join us.
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.
I did tell him where we're staying, though.
And how did you fare?
- Caught one.
- I see.
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?
But an honest, amusing man.
Something about him brightens one's spirits.
He'll be a treasure in hard times.
Much obliged.
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?
That's right.
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.
I'll bring some water.
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.
A modest warrior of the Wood-Chop School.
Just three more to go.
Three? Don't you mean two?
No, we can't afford to take a child along.
Master!
I know, I know.
I know what you'll say.
I was once your age, you know.
Hone your skills, then go to war and do great things.
Then become lord of your own castle and domain.
But as you dream those dreams, before you know it, your hair will turn as gray as mine.
By that time you've lost your parents and you're all alone.
Tomorrow you go home.
You've learned a lot these four or five days.
You have fine stories to tell.
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but --
Actually, kids work harder than adults.
But only if you treat them like adults.
Then let's treat him like an adult.
That means only two more.
Actually just one, it seems.
You wish to join us?
I'm very grateful.
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
This is enough. We don't have time to find the last one.
All right, then.
Master!
Master!
- All right.
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!
Hey, I just found a real tough samurai.
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.
I told him about you.
He's on his way.
Shall we give him the usual?
What are you doing?
Testing him.
That's a dirty trick!
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.
A true samurai won't get hit.
But this guy's drunk!
A samurai never drinks enough to dull his wits.
I told you!
You guys are nuts.
What the --
Who the hell hit me?
You?
Who hit me?
You?
Damn bastard!
You again!
I see that bald head of yours in my dreams!
Hey, you.
How dare you even ask me if I'm a samurai!
You got some nerve!
Don't mess with me.
I may look like hell, but I'm a real samurai!
I've been looking for you ever since that day.
Wanted you to see this.
Look at this!
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.
Damn you, trying to make a fool outta me. Screw you.
Looky here.
Making a fool outta me.
My honorable self is right here.
So this Kikuchiyo here would be you?
That is correct.
"Kikuchiyo, born February 17, 1574."
What's so damned funny?
You hardly look
13 years old to me.
If you are in fact the Kikuchiyo listed here, you'd now be precisely
13 years old.
Where'd you steal this family tree?
Steal it? Shit!
Damn jerks.
To hell with samurai.
To hell with samurai!
Hey, you bastard!
Come back here!
Goddamn it, you son of a bitch!
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.
Damn you!
Come back here!
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?
What's the matter, junior?
Screw samurai!
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.
Take me too!
Hey, Kikuchiyo.
Guard your treasure.
Let me go too!
What is it, Father?
What is it?
What are you staring at?
Shino, cut off your hair.
Cut your hair and dress like a man.
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!
No!
No, I won't!
Shino!
He's a fool.
But Manzo knows those samurai better than anyone.
If he cut off his daughter's hair, he must have good reason.
You've only got sons, so you're safe, but we --
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.
So you agree to hide my daughter at your place across the bridge?
Idiot! I meant that I see what Manzo's up to.
That rascal doesn't care about the village, only about his daughter.
Damn him!
Look what you've done!
Now the whole village is crazed.
Every family with a girl's gone mad.
How do you plan to set this right?
The samurai will show up any day now.
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!
Go home!
We can't let the samurai see us like this.
He's still following us.
Where did Kikuchiyo go?
Think he gave up?
It's funny.
Now that he's gone, it's almost a little...
Lonely.
This way.
Oh, hell!
So that's our castle, eh?
No way I'm gonna die in that dungheap.
No one asked you to.
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!
The samurai are here!
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!
Hey, what's wrong?
What's the matter?
This is a fine welcome.
What's the meaning of this?
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?
Whatever happens in the village, the Old Man --
He's the village elder?
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.
Well, let's go.
I know they're being foolish.
All farmers ever do is worry, whether the rain falls, the sun shines, or the wind blows.
In short, all they know is fear.
Their behavior today... is also due simply to fear.
But Old Man, why do the villagers fear us?
What can they expect from us under such circumstances?
Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!
Quiet down!
Don't panic. Calm down.
I want clear answers.
Where are the bandits coming from?
- The mountains!
- No, the road!
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.
No one saw any bandits?
Then who sounded the alarm?
I did!
Outta the way.
What's with the faces?
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.
Hey, blockheads.
Remember how you welcomed us when we got here?
But as soon as I bang on this,
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"
You're practically groveling!
Got what you deserved, you mud snails.
Got a problem, gramps?
Nope.
All's well now.
Looks like he's good for something after all.
There are seven of us at last.
Sorry it's so dirty.
But where will you sleep if we take your home?
- In the barn.
- With your horse?
The bandits got my horse last year.
A barn's not so bad with a wife to snuggle up to.
I don't have a wife!
What's the matter, you fool?
Jerk.
By the way, what's your real name?
I don't remember.
Give me a new one that fits.
Then Kikuchiyo it is.
Fits you perfectly.
How would you attack this village?
I'd charge from this mountain.
I agree.
Along this road.
WEST
And what's the best defense?
Shichiroji knows what to do.
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.
All right!
Listen.
Nothing forces you to run like a battle.
You run when you attack, you run when you retreat.
When you can't run anymore, you die.
SOUTH
We'll flood these fields after they harvest the barley.
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?
Indeed.
Charge!
Pretend I'm a bandit and stab me.
Charge!
Come on!
Next. 
Next. 
What's wrong with all of you?
EAST
Destroying this bridge will foil an assault from the east.
But what about the houses on the other side?
They'll have to evacuate those.
And the mill?
The Old Man's not going to go quietly.
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.
Everybody's scared.
But the other side's scared of us too.
Just great.
You all make great scarecrows.
Problem is, the enemy isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?
This isn't a cow shed!
Look at the bunch of you.
Shit!
First in line, step forward!
I'm talking to you!
You!
Look here! You gotta pay a mon each to watch the show!
What's this?
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.
Where the hell did you get it?
Did it sprout up in those hills?
I know perfectly well.
You hunted down retreating warriors and took their weapons.
If you've got one, you must have more.
Fess up, damn it!
NORTH
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.
Katsushiro.
We're going.
- I'll be right there.
As I said, he's still a child.
Are you from the village?
Are you a girl?
A boy?
Then where's your spear?
Is this any time for an able-bodied man to be picking flowers?
Come here!
I'll teach you.
Come here!
Why, you!
This is fine, and this too.
But this is a problem.
Heave ho! Heave ho!
Get back, the rest of you!
Stand up straight!
What a haul!
What's all this?
Plunder from defeated warriors.
Where did you find it?
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.
What's the matter?
Don't you like 'em?
This is good stuff.
What's wrong?
You said you wanted armor, spears and bows. Now you got 'em.
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?
Those farmers killed samurai to get these.
- I know that.
- Then why the hell --
That's enough!
You can't understand unless you've been hunted.
It's nothing.
Get outta here.
Now I want to kill them all.
Well, that's just fine and dandy!
What did ya think these farmers were anyway?
Buddhas or something?
Don't make me laugh!
There's no creature on earth as wily as a farmer!
Ask 'em for rice, barley, anything, and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."
But they've got it.
They've got everything.
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.
They kowtow and lie, playing innocent the whole time.
You name it, they'll cheat you on it!
After a battle, they hunt down the losers with their spears.
Listen to me!
Farmers are misers, weasels, and crybabies!
They're mean, stupid murderers!
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?
You did!
You samurai did!
Damn you to hell!
In war, you burn their villages, trample their fields, steal their food, work them like slaves, rape their women, and kill 'em if they resist.
What do you expect 'em to do?
What the hell are farmers supposed to do?
Damn it! Goddamn it!
You were born a farmer, weren't you?
What is it now?
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.
It's me.
I'm sleeping here from now on.
Those guys cramp my style.
Idiot! Stop cowering!
This is your place!
You hand over your house and sleep in a barn, and still you can't stand up for yourself.
Get to sleep!
Brings back memories.
Sure is quiet.
On a day like this, it's hard to imagine bandits on that mountain.
Damn it all,
I need a girl!
- Where are you going?
- The hills.
- The hills?
- To practice.
No girls up there.
Sometimes you really hit the nail on the head.
What are you making there?
- A flag.
- A flag?
It doesn't feel right in battle without a banner to raise high.
What do the symbols mean?
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.
- And those circles?
- Those are us.
There's only six.
You leaving me out?
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.
That's a good one!
It's real rice.
Go ahead. Eat.
- But --
Rikichi gave me some millet.
I could barely get it down.
Go ahead. Eat.
Hurry up and eat.
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.
I'm not going to eat it.
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.
No, I just --
I know you did, so I'll take it to Kyuemon's grandma.
Kyuemon's grandma?
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.
Go ahead and eat.
Take my leftovers this time.
What's this?
What are you up to?
What's going on?
How terrible.
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.
I... want to die quickly.
I want to die soon and leave this suffering behind.
But you know... the other world may be just as full of suffering as this one.
It's not.
In that world there's no war and no bandits.
There's no suffering there, grandma.
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?
Why the hell are you always screaming?
I hate wimps.
Worms like her make me sick!
Pissing and grumbling about everything.
Shit!
I want to do something wild!
Save your spit and fire for the bandits.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, but why did you --
You saw us today, didn't you?
Me and the --
- The girl?
- Yes.
Why didn't you --
- Tell them? You want me to?
We want rice!
White rice!
You little brats!
There's no rice!
Quit yapping!
If you've got the strength to scream, "We want rice!"
Then you don't need it!
Listen here, you little piss pants.
This is all the rice there is.
If we give you any more, we'll get all --
That's how it is.
Say, any of you got a pretty sister?
How about you?
You got one?
So, Old Man, when is the harvest?
In ten days.
How quickly can you do it?
No less than three days.
We'll flood the fields when you're done.
You see, we want to create a moat to the south of the village.
It'll keep the horses out.
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.
Then... it'll take at least a day to flatten the paths and draw the water.
Understood.
There's one other thing.
You need to leave the houses this side of the bridge, and the mill too.
Father!
You want us to move out?
I know it's tough.
But there's no choice.
We can't possibly protect the outlying houses.
Listen carefully. You'll soon begin harvesting the barley.
The bandits will come when you're done.
We have to assume that.
Therefore we prepare for battle as we harvest.
We'll harvest not as families but as squads.
Starting tomorrow, each squad will live and work as one.
Understood? Starting tomorrow, nobody acts on his own.
Hey, everybody.
Give your wives plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?
This is all a load of crap!
Everyone from across the bridge, follow me.
Throw down your spears.
Why should we abandon our homes to protect theirs?
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.
Stop!
Pick up your spears!
Return to your line!
Fall in!
Squad formation!
Where's Yohei gone?
Where the hell's Yohei?
There you are, you idiot!
There are three outlying houses, but 20 in the village.
We can't risk 20 to save three.
And if this village is destroyed, those three cannot survive on their own.
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:
By protecting others, you save yourself.
If you only think of yourself, you'll only destroy yourself.
From this day forward, anyone caught doing that...
Hot damn!
Look at all those girls!
Hey, Yohei!
Where the hell have you been hiding these girls?
You devil.
Hey, lend me your scythe.
I'll cut three times your share.
In return, we get nice and friendly, eh?
- Rikichi.
- Yes.
It seems the married couples are the most productive.
Time you got yourself a wife.
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should --
Katsushiro, go after him.
Running off at a time like this.
Rikichi!
Rikichi!
Shino, what are you gawking at?
What's this? A bear's den?
This was done with a scythe.
Was it Rikichi?
Yes, though I didn't actually see him do it.
I lost him for a while, but then I spotted him leaving this grove.
He was furious, soaked in sweat.
What did you say to him?
Nothing. Just that he should hurry up and find a wife.
Something's upsetting the little bugger, but he won't say what.
You can see it all over his face.
Those lips of his are bolted up tight as a house.
Why don't you try to open them up?
Who's there?
It's me. 
All clear?
- Yes.
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.
I think talking... is a good thing.
Whatever your burden may be, talking can ease it.
You, for example, seem pretty tight-lipped, but if you're suffering, you shouldn't bottle it up.
Letting out your feelings bit by bit can work wonders.
I've got nothing to say.
Time to head out.
Shall we wake him?
No, let the kid sleep.
Shino.
I swear he just said "Shino."
Sounds like a woman's name.
Even kids can be charmers in their dreams.
Where shall we start our rounds?
The place that worries us most, of course.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Come out here!
Who's there?
Kikuchiyo.
You're lucky it was us.
If we'd been bandits, you'd be headless right now.
Yohei.
What's this?
That's my horse, sir.
I thought it was a big old mouse.
The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp
The crows caw, caw, caw
I wonder why the bandits aren't coming.
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!
A nag like that can't carry your weight!
Yohei's horse is too worn out.
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears if you break its leg.
A skilled horseman can make even a nag soar into the sky.
Not bad.
Very fine indeed!
They seem to be having fun.
The threshing's done, and still no bandits.
Everyone's saying they might not come after all.
A tempting thought.
But when you think you're safe is precisely when you're most vulnerable.
Send them back to their posts.
I wish I'd been born into a samurai family.
A farmer's life is too cruel.
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.
That's not what I meant.
It's because you're a samurai and I'm a farmer.
But I don't --
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know what the future holds!
Coward!
Act like a samurai!
Three suspicious characters on the western road.
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.
We can't have them sounding the alarm.
I saw three horses up in the hills.
I think they're bandits.
- We know.
- So they're here.
- How did you know?
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?
The west.
Bandits!
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.
Tell them to keep quiet no matter what.
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.
What is it?
Bandits?
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?
Quiet!
Where are they, Shichiroji?
Beyond the fence.
No doubt about it -- they're scouts.
The fence took them by surprise.
They don't seem to realize we're here.
With luck they'll report there are only farmers here.
Hey, where is everyone?
That idiot!
Kikuchiyo!
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.
You fool.
Too late.
They've seen us.
If they report back that samurai are here, we're finished.
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.
I was just --
Enough. You can make up for it by getting one.
Head them off at --
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.
Katsushiro!
Just watch, you understand?
Those are some horses!
Wait in this hollow.
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?
Katsushiro.
You can come out now.
Help me!
Back off!
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.
You can't just chop him to pieces.
Stay out of this!
Let me do it! Scum!
All right.
Let her avenge her son's death.
Someone help her!
I'll do it!
- That bandit said their fort --
- It's hardly a fort.
It's full of holes, like Yohei's underwear.
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.
Wait. We can't afford to lose a single man, even if we kill five for every one lost.
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.
Rikichi.
How far away is their hideout?
At least a day.
Hey, we've got three of their horses.
Half a day by horse.
Very well. Let's do it.
If we leave now, we'll arrive before dawn.
But who should go?
Not you.
And me makes three.
They need a guide!
There aren't enough horses.
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.
The only man to master that steed is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.
Whoa! What the hell?
It's the other way!
Stupid horse!
This way, you useless mule!
You call yourself a horse?
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Hey, wait!
Please stop!
I apologize!
I'm sorry!
Hey, let's set the place on fire!
Cut 'em down as they run out!
Serves you right!
We did it!
Take that, you sons of bitches!
Heihachi!
Are you crazy?
Stupid idiot!
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?
She's my wife!
Heihachi, hang on!
You said... he'd be a treasure in hard times.
The hard times have only just begun.
Stop crying!
Damn fool!
Stop crying!
Goddamn!
Here they come!
Take note:
They have three muskets.
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.
- Muskets?
- Three in all.
Take the south, and watch out for those muskets.
Retreat! Retreat!
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?
An arrow got one of them.
Good old Gorobei.
Make sure the eastern bridge is out, and watch out for --
The muskets!
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.
If you knew that, why didn't you build a fence there too?
Every great castle needs a breach.
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.
Use your balls, if you've got any!
Take it away, damn it!
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?
And he said to watch out for the muskets.
What kinda idiot you take me for?
Where are you going?
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.
Stubborn old fool!
Hurry up and get him!
Get out of our way!
What are you doing?
Hurry up!
- On this mountain --
- Twenty riders.
And 12 to the east.
Right.
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.
Good! Again!
Again!
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.
Everybody out here!
Raise your spears and give the battle cry.
Again!
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!
Take cover!
Here they come!
Goddamn 'em!
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Oh, no, you don't!
Don't panic!
Goddamn you!
They're burning!
Damn bastards!
Back to your posts, everyone!
Dear!
They're just rickety shacks!
Everybody, back to your posts!
Goddamn it!
You dogs!
That's the Old Man's house!
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!
Kikuchiyo, come back!
Kikuchiyo!
Where's the Old Man and your husband?
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?
Let's go!
Damn it, what is it now?
This baby... is me.
This is just what happened to me!
Here we go!
What the hell?
What the hell were you staring at?
Idiot!
No one wounded?
Good.
You did a fine job.
Fine job!
Gunpowder!
Take cover!
Manzo!
Where were you hit?
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.
Don't bother.
If this kills you, you'd die of a fleabite.
You make a ruckus over a little scratch and blow your daughter's cover in the process. Nice going!
You don't have to chase them all down.
That's far enough.
Well done.
Who are you?
Rikichi.
They've attacked from the east, west and south and run away each time with their tails between their legs.
This is the only approach left.
We don't know if they'll come tonight, but when they do, they'll mass their forces here.
Perhaps, but...
I don't hear a thing.
Nevertheless, this will surely be the focus of their attack.
I'll prove it to you in a minute.
Good work.
Now poke that scarecrow out from behind those trees.
I'd say tomorrow morning they'll attack us here with everything they've got.
And we'll let them in.
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.
Two at most.
Once they're in, we form a wall again with our spears.
The one or two who get in are as good as dead.
We can cook 'em up any way we want.
We'll pick them off patiently, one by one, until the final showdown.
Those muskets worry me.
If only we could get one of them.
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.
Footsteps! Listen!
That's enough.
Get some rest.
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.
I said enough.
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.
I hear them.
Two more down.
What is it?
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.
You are a magnificent person.
I've wanted to tell you so for some time.
They're here.
We'll let one in.
We're letting one in!
Remember, after the first one's in, jump out with your spears.
Here they come.
Step aside!
Good work.
What's wrong?
You did well.
Here he comes!
Scatter!
Fall back! Fall back!
After them!
Another on the way!
Here he comes.
Watch this!
Having fun with your horsey?
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.
That man is a true samurai.
He's fearless, his swordsmanship is amazing, and yet he's kind too.
He never once boasted about capturing that musket.
He walked into a forest filled with bandits as if on a mushroom hunt.
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.
Hey, Yohei.
Take over for me.
What's that face for?
There's no danger here now.
You make a great scarecrow.
Hear me good!
If anybody else turns yellow --
Out of my way!
Hey!
How's it goin'?
Man, they're a pain.
Won't be long now.
Everything's upside down.
They burn us out, and we starve like farmers.
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.
Do your part, man.
Hey, it's me!
Serves you right, you dogs!
Fool!
Why did you leave your post?
Just look at this!
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.
There's nothing heroic about selfishly grabbing for glory.
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!
Gorobei and Kyuzo, guard this post!
Let no one pass!
Stop, you asses!
Damn you!
Damn it! Two made it in!
Goddamn it!
Where's Yohei?
Yohei!
Yohei!
I defended my post.
Don't give up, Yohei!
Go ahead, shoot me!
Shichiroji, take over!
Gorobei!
Gorobei!
Just 13 left.
But these last seven... came at a steep price.
How are you? Tired?
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.
I'll go throw some water on my face.
Next time they come, we fight to the finish.
It's better we fight it out before we're spent.
When do you think they'll attack?
They're exhausted too, and a few are wounded.
They won't come tonight.
But they have no food, and their ranks are splitting.
They can't afford to dawdle either.
I say they'll come at us like hell tomorrow morning.
Katsushiro.
An order from above.
Place two on watch and let the rest sleep.
The men may visit their families one at a time.
So tomorrow's the showdown?
Yes.
Please carry out the order.
You all heard what he just said.
I'll stand guard.
The rest of you sleep.
Manzo... you go home first.
Take a good look at your daughter --
I mean, your son.
I told them.
All right. Get some rest.
Katsushiro.
How was Kikuchiyo?
Still beside the grave.
I see.
Are we all going to die tomorrow?
There's no way to know.
But we might!
Shino.
Where's Shino?
Anyone seen Shino?
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?
I see. They have stockpiles, just like Kikuchiyo said, and tonight it all comes out.
I think I'll help myself.
Shino!
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.
Shino!
You tramp!
You wench!
Stop this brutality!
What the hell's a farmer girl doing with a samurai?
You slut!
Manzo.
Is this your daughter?
Tell me what happened.
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?
Manzo!
Manzo, say something.
Speak!
Are you Shino?
Manzo, don't be angry.
When the dawn threatens our very lives, the weight of it makes us all a little reckless.
On the eve of decisive battles... this often happens, even inside castles.
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.
I can't forgive them.
I can't stand by when my only daughter has been made damaged goods.
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.
Everyone, the final battle is here at last.
By the way, Katsushiro, we expect much of you today.
As of last night, you became a real man.
Hey!
Where's that fighting spirit?
You'll never win with such long faces!
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?
I can't kill five with just one blade.
There are 13 left.
We'll let them all in.
Once they pass this point, we close in from all sides at the crossing.
Everything's riding on this battle!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Shichiroji and Katsushiro, go west!
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!
Katsushiro! Rikichi!
East! Go east!
East!
Shut up!
Scream and you're dead!
We did it!
We did it!
Head east!
Katsushiro, pull back!
Damn you!
Kikuchiyo!
Kikuchiyo!
Where are the bandits?
They're all dead!
Once more we survive.
In the end, we lost this battle too.
What?
I mean, the victory belongs to those peasants.
Not to us.
THE END
Let's do a take.
Lights out! Rain!
Less rain!
"Can't you sleep?"
"I heard someone.
I knew it was you."
"You can't sleep either?"
"I was thinking of you."
"You know what's happening to us?"
"Yes, I'm in love with you."
"How long have you known?"
"We both knew at the costume party."
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."
"I've thought of it, too."
"I want us to leave together."
"That would be like running away."
"Yes it would, I know."
"But I don't want to lose you."
"Then let's leave now, like thieves in the night."
Cut! How was it, Walter?
Fine, perfect!
What do we do next?
We do it again.
Like thieves in the night.
Like thieves...
We've been looking for you for an hour!
I was waiting in my dressing-room.
But you were told last night.
No, I wasn't!
I didn't get a call-sheet.
All right, let's do it now.
The shooting is half-finished.
Before starting,
I hope to make a fine movie.
The problems begin and I aim lower!
I hope to make the movie... period!
Halfway through I say to myself:
"You could've worked harder, given more."
"You can still make up for it!"
And I start trying harder to bring the film to life.
"Meet Pamela" is on the right track, now.
The actors are into their roles, the crew is solid, problems resolved.
Cinema is King!
The drinks are on Alexandre today!
Any champagne left?
No, we'll have to move on to Pernod.
Champagne's gone.
You won't get drunk.
Make yourselves at home.
Help yourselves!
He's handsome enough to be in movies.
He wants no part of it.
He's into tennis.
I want to ask you something.
I've decided to adopt Christian.
I've always wanted a son.
Maybe I'm silly, but I want someone to bear my name after I'm gone.
It's a wonderful idea!
But there are problems.
Legal ones, I mean.
I'm not married now, and he hasn't got a French passport.
Know what you should do?
Talk to President Lebaille!
The electrician's grandfather.
Go fish!
The cameraman's mother...
Meet Mark Spencer.
He's the British stuntman.
- Just got here, speaks no French.
- Julie will help.
Tell him the car-crash we're shooting tomorrow will be in "nuit americaine"
What's that?
A night scene shot in daylight with a special filter.
Dressed as she is now.
He didn't understand.
I speak English well, but don't understand it!
Stay here with me this morning.
Are you crazy?
Why? What are they shooting today?
Pamela's death.
The stuntman's doing the car-crash.
See? It's not an important scene!
I'm late. They're waiting.
Follow me and watch for the arrows!
What's this watch?
Pierrot lent it to me.
Mine's being fixed.
Give it back to him!
I'll buy you a watch, if you need one.
- Making it tough on me?
- Go on...
But that's mine. Keep it for me!
Sure, I will.
Hurry, guys! Let's move it!
What are you doing today?
And you?
I'm going antique-hunting.
I'll go to a movie.
What's the matter?
A damned flat!
And you don't know how to change a tire!
Help me!
I'll be late for the shooting.
When you're driving, you don't need a man!
We'll be late.
Move! It must be up front.
- You've never used a jack?
- I'm not a mechanic!
Neither am I!
What if you run out of gas?
Then I put some in.
In the carburetor, probably!
There. We're filthy!
I'll change into my sweater.
Hold that.
Joelle, if you're in the mood...
For what?
We're all alone here...
OK, you're on!
What?
All bark and no bite!
But when it's time for action...
You're willing?
But we haven't got all day.
Move it!
So where's Joelle?
She's not here. Neither is Bernard!
A life-size inflatable doll, guys!
For the car!
Or for your bathtub!
You're lucky he doesn't understand!
He'd slug you!
This isn't slow-motion, move your asses!
You've all got sex on the brain.
Dirty talk all day long!
Whatch a doing, making a movie?
You need stars, we're available!
Let the workers through.
We're all farmers, right?
- Right, we're all farmers!
- Funny, you don't look Jewish!
Heard from your wife and kids,
Pierrot?
- So you finally got here!
- My car broke down!
Lucky I left after her, or she'd...
Fill me in.
Hey, you changed your top.
Ready to shoot!
OK, second camera?
- The stuntman?
- He's done.
Then he can pack up and leave.
He promised me a ride, but he took Liliane instead.
Pretty cool!
What's all that luggage?
I might as well tell you.
We're in love.
He's taking me to London.
The film's not finished!
They don't need me,
I'm a fifth wheel.
You can't just quit.
They only hired me for Alphonse's sake.
How is he taking this?
He'll get the surprise tonight.
He'll be terribly upset!
He's always terribly upset.
He's a spoiled brat who won't grow up.
He loves you and wants to marry you.
He mentioned marriage, I didn't!
Just the word gives me the creeps.
Anyway, he needs a wife, a mistress, a nanny, a nurse, a sister...
I can't play all those roles!
You're being cruel, and don't even realize it.
I'm through with Alphonse!
He wants the whole world to pay for his unhappy childhood!
Julie, come get in the photo!
What photo?
A souvenir for me. It's my last day!
Wait. Here comes Stacey.
Come on, Stacey.
We're proud of you!
Stand there.
Looks like it's due soon.
And it's not even twins!
Lucky girl!
All her shots will be close-ups now!
Don't move!
Wait! We're missing Liliane!
Where is she?
I have to talk to you.
Liliane won't be coming...
She was right to leave.
I understand, it had to end this way.
Don't move!
Now Alphonse has disappeared!
And where's Odile?
Liliane ran off with the stuntman.
Does Alphonse know?
I had to tell him.
With the stuntman!
I'd drop a guy for a film.
I'd never drop a film for a guy!
Can you manage?
I'll explain...
We built this to convey that you live across from your in-laws.
I'll cue you, as Alphonse isn't here.
He's in love, so we're in a pickle!
Good title: "The Pickles of Love"
"Rise and shine, kids!"
"Come have breakfast with us!"
"Alphonse is in bed."
Next line, Julie!
"We're invited over."
"We'll be right there."
Cut! Once more!
"Come have breakfast with us!"
"Alphonse is asleep."
No, no..."in bed!"
"We're invited over."
I know you're in there!
Open up. Everyone's asking for you.
They are not!
Severine leaves for Italy tonight.
I don't want to see anyone!
This actor had always dreamed of playing Hamlet.
At last he staged it and played the role!
But he was so bad, he was booed every night.
One night he was fed up, he stopped in the middle of "To be or not to be..."
Turning to the audience, he said:
The champagne, at last!
You still have to finish "Pamela"!
I'm so sad to be leaving.
Come join us, machos!
Move your table!
Why are you all alone over there?
Are you sad, in love, heartbroken?
Don't! He's a just hotel guest.
So what?
Come join us, Mr Hotel Guest!
We're a movie crew having a farewell party.
I'll introduce you.
Can I talk to you?
I think we should get Alphonse.
He's locked in his room, sulking!
He's a drag.
That's unfair.
I've known him for ages.
Never fails!
Then I'll go.
I'll try again.
Come see the great photos!
She's so cute...
She's not! Out!
What a funny life we lead!
We meet, we work together...
We love each other, and then...
As soon as we grasp something...
It's gone! See?
Severine is extraordinary.
We made a film together in Italy.
She was so good, the director kept saying:
"She's greater than Eleanora Duse!"
So I called her Superduse!
Seen Alphonse?
He's locked in and won't come out.
Well, Severine's gone, so...
I need money to go to a whorehouse.
Come on, Alphonse.
Go back to your room, re-read the script, learn your lines, then try to sleep.
Tomorrow we work.
That's what matters.
Don't be a fool.
You're a very good actor.
No one's private life runs smoothly.
That only happens in the movies.
No traffic jams, no dead periods.
Movies go along like trains in the night.
And people like you and me are only happy in our work.
I'm counting on you.
"Which costume shall I choose for Saturday?"
Swltch the call from for 227 to 41+5
It's Alphonse.
I wanted to tell you
I'm leaving tonight.
You've always been my friend.
Tell Ferrand for me.
I have to talk to you. Wait!
Goodbye and thanks.
Wait for me!
What is all this? You can't leave.
I am, I'm giving it all up.
You'll stay and finish the film.
Even if I stayed,
I'm too upset to work!
I'm a physical wreck.
Is it normal for someone to stop loving you and just walk out?
Then it was all phony, sickening!
I know how much you've been hurt.
But I think Liliane still loves you.
You're being selfish, too.
You know it's difficult for an outsider to live with an actor.
But to leave with just anyone!
Some Brit stuntman!
Careful! I'm a Brit, too.
And I know those stuntmen.
You know what'll happen to their affair.
At first, he'll take her everywhere with him.
Then he'll get bored and she'll feel lost all alone in London.
She'll be back in 2 weeks.
Think so?
Anyway, it's over now.
I'd rather suffer.
You see,
I've made a terrible discovery.
You can be desperately in love with someone you despise.
Whose every gesture, word and thought you detest!
What right have you to say that?
Say you made a mistake, but never be ashamed of having loved!
By despising Liliane you're merely... degrading yourself.
Maybe you're right.
Anyway, my love-affairs have always ended badly.
I thought women were magic.
Of course they're not magic.
Or men are, too.
Everyone's magic, and no one is.
I'm sure Ferrand is wrong.
Life is more important than films.
I'm going now. Thank you.
Don't be a fool.
Stay and finish your work.
Is that clock working?
It's 6 AM! Time to make coffee!
Have you seen Julie?
I'm looking for Lajoie!
Know what that idiot did?
Mixed up his dates and sent the costumes back!
So you've been up for hours?
All night, getting the costumes from the airport.
Or no shooting today!
Where could Julie be?
In her room?
Her bed hasn't been slept in.
Everyone's nuts on this movie!
- What time is it?
- 6 AM.
- Where you going?
- To work.
You can sleep 2 more hours,
I set the alarm.
Stay with me.
I can't.
I have a make-up call for the costume party scene.
Wait!
Kiss me.
You won't forget?
We'll go away together when the film's done.
Sleep.
Dr Nelson? It's Alphonse.
I have something to tell you.
I love your wife.
I slept with her. Set her free!
Julie, call for you.
I think it's your husband.
- You owe me for this bill!
- Not now!
Later it'll be too late!
You looked everywhere?
He's not in his room?
Alphonse has disappeared!
Could he have gone to Paris?
There are flights at 8:50 and 10:10
Call the airport.
You call, I'll go.
If he's there, I'll bring him back.
- We've got trouble!
- I know, Alphonse is gone.
I mean Julie! Nerves, I guess.
She locked herself in, won't see anyone.
You can hear her crying.
I hope it's not another breakdown!
Let's go see.
There's Odile.
She got a call from Dr Nelson,
I think.
She asked me to leave, and locked the door.
It's me, open the door!
Open up, we're your friends!
As producer, I want to help you.
Quiet!
You don't think she'd...
- Will she talk to you?
- She won't open the door.
You can hear her crying.
She keeps us out, and lets Stacey in!
Motherhood has its privileges.
We can't find Alphonse anywhere.
Julie didn't sleep in her room.
Alphonse disappears,
Dr Nelson calls.
The picture's pretty clear!
What is this movie business?
Where everyone sleeps with everyone!
Everyone lies!
Do you think it's normal?
Your movie world...
I think it stinks!
I despise it!
Lajoie, calm your wife down!
That woman's wrong.
Movie people may be more obvious about it, but love makes the world go round!
She wants tub butter.
Country butter, in bulk.
Is she crazy? What's she doing?
Crying. She'll stop, but find her some tub butter!
Find some tub butter.
No way! It's not in the script!
That's not nice, or friendly!
Aren't we one big family?
So were the people in Greek tragedies!
Tub butter!
All right, I'll find it myself.
He's really quite lucky.
Some whims are more expensive!
There was an Austrian actress,
Hedy Lamarr, became a big Hollywood star.
She really missed the rainy climate of her native Tyrol.
So, in her garden in California, she installed a rain-making machine.
So a little thing like tub butter...
Come help me!
This is all I could find.
That's not it!
There's no tub butter on the whole Riviera!
So we'll knead this into one block... wrap it in gauze, and it'll look like it!
Think it'll work?
It has to.
What a business!
I found Alphonse. Where?
You'll never guess!
I'll bring him in.
There you are!
Here's the famous tub butter.
I won't deliver it!
No! Like the chef in "Rules Of The Game",
"I cater to diets, but not fads!"
Here's what you asked for.
You didn't!
Forgive me.
I'm so ashamed!
I'll be all right in a minute.
I know it's not very professional.
I don't like being like this, holding you up.
It's all right, we can wait a while.
We'll change the schedule.
Don't change it because of me!
I'll be all right in a minute.
Can you lend me a handkerchief?
I must look awful.
Why did Alphonse do it?
He didn't understand anything!
He acted like the child he is.
I saw enough of your husband to know he's a wonderful man.
Yes, he is.
But you don't know the whole story.
When I had my breakdown, he did a very serious thing.
He left his wife and children.
He gave up a life it took him 20 years to create.
He did that for me.
He devoted himself to me.
He tried to make me into a responsible adult.
Now he must think it was an awful waste.
No, when he knows what happened, he'll understand.
He'll forget, it'll be over.
You think so?
Even if that's true,
I'll never forget...
Thanks to him,
I know I can change my life.
I've decided to live alone.
I'm sick of disguises.
I'm quitting movies.
I know that life is rotten.
Since we can't shoot, we'll record some wild tracks.
- Ready, Ren?
- OK. Applause first.
Now some background talk.
Don't discuss movies!
Now more applause.
Julie's dressing-room is upstairs-right.
I called him and he agreed to come!
I really screwed up.
What can I say to Julie when I see her?
- Should I apologize?
- The less said, the better.
I've made up my mind.
I'm quitting movies.
That's a good idea, you do that!
Are you seeing Julie?
Give her this new dialogue for the scene.
She's to learn it.
Can I fix your make-up now?
I'm fine now.
We'll make ourselves beautiful!
This is your new dialogue for the scene.
"Even if that's true,
I'll never forget..."
"I've decided to live alone."
"I know that life is rotten."
He's got some nerve!
Are you all right, Julie?
Let's do it!
"I've decided to live alone."
"I know that life is rotten."
"No, it isn't."
Cut! Once more, for the hands.
The candle okay?
- Places.
- Places, and quiet please!
I'll caress her with this hand.
Places.
And let's do it.
"I've decided to live alone."
"I know that life is rotten."
"No, it isn't."
Cut. That was the best one!
Alexandre is dead!
A car accident.
Returning from the airport, where went to meet Christian.
A truck hit their car.
Christian is badly hurt, but he'll recover.
Alexandre died... on the way to the hospital.
Alexandre was buried in a little cemetery above Nice.
Now the film's fate was in the hands of the English insurers.
What I always feared had happened: a productlon halted by death.
The era of studlo movies died with Alexandre.
Films will be shot in the streets, without stars, or scripts.
There will be no more films like "Meet Pamela".
"Hello, Pamela!"
"Come have breakfast with us!"
"Alphonse is still asleep!"
No..."in bed?"
"We're invited over."
"We'll be right there."
- Was that OK?
- Fine. Cut!
Wait, I'm coming over!
I was afraid he might have an accident.
I offered him a driver.
He wasn't at home anywhere.
Always rushing off somewhere.
A man in a hurry.
No, he was at home everywhere.
He liked people, he lived for the moment.
He couldn't leave places.
He was rushing back not to be late.
You could say, he died out of generosity.
You may be right.
Now we have to finish the film.
What does the insurance company say?
Mr Johanson talked at length to London last night.
You can't re-shoot Alexandre's scenes with another actor.
The only solution is to simplify the script and finish shooting in 5 days instead of 2 weeks.
Then the insurance will cover everything.
5 days!
We'll have to simplify things.
We'll leave Alexandre out of the costume party scene.
Then the shot with the candles makes no sense any more.
We'll cut the costume party scene.
The story works without it.
Then the only important scene left, is when Alphonse kills his father.
We can shoot it in the street, and hire a stand-in for Alexandre.
It won't work, unless Alphonse shoots him in the back.
Why not? In the back!
It's better, far more violent.
Why not have it all take place in the snow?
All right, Walter.
Just like last time.
But we'll be closer on Alphonse this time.
But we have to see the gun.
Here's the stand-in.
Could you walk away?
We have to see how you look.
Too much hair on the neck.
It has to work!
That's Alexandre's stand-in.
Trim his hair more like Alexandre's.
This is the gun you wanted for Alphonse, right?
If that's the one I chose, sure.
Places, everybody. Hurry!
Hurry, please!
To the places I showed you!
I don't want the snow too white, or too clean.
Don't worry, I'll fix it like in "The Snow Was Black"
I've been offered a movie in Tokyo.
I want to accept.
Turgenev's "First Love", a good story.
For a movie?
With a Japanese girl and you as the Frenchman, sure!
I'll do it because it's Tokyo.
13,000 miles from my problems!
Should I hold the gun like this?
Or like that?
Like that.
So it's seen against the snow.
Dr Nelson and Julie want to say goodbye.
- Off to London?
- Australia! A medical conference.
Be ready to shoot when I get back!
See you in Paris for the post-synch!
Let's go before it gets dark!
Good luck.
You, too.
More discreetly!
Walk faster!
The gun!
Run away!
Run to the far end!
Cut!
Shooting's over! Thanks, everyone!
Going back to Paris?
No, I'm staying around here for a rest.
Have a nice rest.
My car was wrecked in the stunt.
I've got another one in Paris, but I need a ride.
With me? Impossible!
It's full of my gear.
Anyway, I like to be independent!
Yann, wait for me!
See you in the bread line!
Unemployment, here we come!
I'm taking Odile to meet my folks.
We're getting married.
Well, very cagey of you!
I bet no one suspected.
She's experienced and I'm not.
A happy medium!
All the best, congratulations.
And thanks. Great camera work!
Glad you like it.
'Bye, kids! Have a nice trip.
Drive carefully!
Could you talk to us about Alexandre?
No, it's too personal.
Ask Bertrand, the producer.
He refused.
- Alphonse?
- He won't talk about death!
Sorry...
I'll talk to you!
Got him framed?
- Who's he?
- Props, I think.
Wasn't it a hard film to make?
Lots of trouble during the shooting?
Not at all! It went fine!
And we hope audiences enjoy seeing it as much as we enjoyed making it!
Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.
It; s about five o; clock in the morning.
That; s the homicide squad, complete
with detectives and newspapermen.
A murder; s been reported from one
of those houses in the 10000 block.
You; ll read about it
in the late editions.
You; ll get it over your radio
and on television,
because an old-time star is involved,
one of the biggest.
But before you hear it all distorted
and blown out of proportion,
before those Hollywood
columnists get their hands on it,
maybe you; d like to hear the facts,
the whole truth.
If so, you; ve come to the right party.
The body of a young man was found
in the pool of her mansion,
with two shots in his back and one
in his stomach. Nobody important.
Just a writer with a couple
of B-pictures to his credit.
The poor dope!
He always wanted a pool.
In the end, he got himself a pool,
only the price turned out a little high.
Let; s go back about six months
and find the day when it all started.
I was living in an apartment house
above Franklin and lvar.
Things were tough at the moment.
I hadn; t worked
in a studio for a long time.
So I sat there grinding out
original stories, two a week.
Only I seemed to have lost my touch.
Maybe they weren; t original enough,
maybe they were too original.
All I know is,
they didn; t sell.
Yep?
- Joseph C Gillis?
- That's right.
- We've come for the car.
- What car?
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California licence 40 R 116.
- Where are the keys?
- Why should I give you them?
The company's played ball long enough, you're three payments behind.
And we've got a court order.
The keys.
- Or do you want us to haul it away?
- The car isn't here.
- Is that so?
- I loaned it to a friend.
- He took it to Palm Springs.
- Gone away for his health?
- If you don't believe me, look.
- We believe you, now believe us.
That car better be here by noon tomorrow or there'll be fireworks.
You say the cutest things.
I needed about $290 and I needed
it real quick, or l; d lose my car.
It wasn; t in Palm Springs,
and it wasn; t in the garage.
I was way ahead
of the finance company.
I knew they; d come
and I wasn; t taking chances.
So I kept it across the street
behind Rudy; s shoeshine parlour.
Rudy never asked any questions
about your finances,
he; d just look at your heels
and know the score.
I had an original story
kicking around Paramount.
My agent said it was dead,
but I knew a bigshot who liked me.
The time had come to take advantage
of it. His name was Sheldrake.
He was a smart producer
with a set of ulcers to prove it.
You've got five minutes.
What's your story about?
A baseball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347, once did a hold-up, but he's trying to go straight, except some gamblers won't let him.
They tell him he's got to throw the World Series?
More or less. I've got a gimmick.
- Got a title?
- "Bases Loaded". There's an outline.
Call readers department, find out what they have on "Bases Loaded".
They're pretty hot about it at Twentieth, except Zanuck's all wet.
Can you see
Ty Power as the shortstop?
You've got the best man, Alan Ladd.
It'd be a change of pace for Ladd.
And simple to shoot.
Lots of outdoors stuff. I bet you could make it for under a million.
- Excuse me.
- There's a great part for Bill Demarest.
An old trainer got beaned, goes out of his head sometimes.
Hello, Mr Sheldrake. "Bases Loaded",
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.
- Thanks.
- But I wouldn't bother.
- What's wrong?
- It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
It's a rehash of something not very good.
You'll be glad to meet Mr Gillis, he wrote it. This is Miss Kramer.
The name's Schaefer, Betty Schaefer.
I wish I could crawl in a hole with it.
- If I could be of any help.
- Sorry, I just didn't think it was good.
I found it flat and trite.
What kind of material do you recommend? Joyce, Dostoyevsky?
I think pictures should say something.
Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down "Gone with the Wind".
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"
I hated "Bases Loaded" because I knew your name. I'd heard you had talent.
This year, I'm trying to earn a living.
So you take plot 27 A, make it glossy and slick?
Those are dirty words.
You sound like New York critics.
- That'll be all Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr Gillis.
Next time, I'll write you
"The Naked and the Dead".
Well, seems like Zanuck has got himself a baseball picture.
Don't think I thought this would win an Academy Award.
We're looking for a Betty Hutton.
Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
- Frankly, no.
- Wait a minute.
If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers, might be a musical: "It Happened in the Bullpen: The Story of a Woman".
Are you trying to be funny, because
I'm out of laughs. I need a job.
- I haven't got a thing.
- Any assignment, additional dialogue.
Nothing, honest.
Mr Sheldrake, could you let me have
300 bucks as a personal loan?
Could I? Gillis...
Last year, somebody talked me into buying a ranch, so I borrowed the money.
This year, I had to mortgage the ranch to keep up my life insurance...
After that,
I drove down to headquarters.
That; s how a lot of us
think about Schwab; s drugstore.
Kind of a combination office,
Kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.
Waiting... Waiting for the gravy train.
I got myself ten nickels and started
sending out a general SOS.
I couldn; t get hold of my agent,
naturally.
So I called a pal of mine,
Artie Green.
An awful nice guy,
an assistant director.
He could let me have twenty,
but twenty wouldn; t do.
Then I talked to a couple of yes-men
at Metro. To me, they said no.
Finally, I located that agent of mine.
The big faker!
Was he out digging up
a job for poor Joe Gillis?
He was hard at work in Bel Air,
making with the golf sticks.
You need $300? Of course I could give you $300, only I'm not going to.
- No?
- I'm not just your agent.
- It's not the 10%. I'm your friend.
- You are?
The finest things have been written on an empty stomach.
Once your talent gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget that! It's a car I'm talking about. Losing it is like losing my legs.
Greatest thing that could happen.
Now you'll have to sit down and write.
What do you think I've been doing?
I need $300.
Sweetheart, maybe what you need is another agent.
As I drove back towards town,
I took inventory of my prospects.
They now added up to exactly zero.
Apparently,
I just didn; t have what it takes.
The time had come to wrap up
the Hollywood deal and go home.
Maybe if I hocked all my junk, there; d
be enough for a ticket back to Ohio,
to that $35-a-week job at the copy
desk of the; ; Dayton Evening Post; ;,
if it was still open, back
to the smirking delight of the office.
All right, why don; t you
take a crack at Hollywood?
Maybe you think you could...
Uh-oh!
l; d landed in the driveway
of some big mansion
that looked rundown and deserted.
At the end of the drive
was a lovely sight.
A great big empty garage,
just standing there going to waste.
If ever there was a place to stash
a car with a hot licence number.
There was another
occupant in that garage.
An enormous
foreign-built automobile.
It must; ve burned up
ten gallons to a mile.
It had a 1932 licence. I figured that; s
when the owners had moved out.
I couldn; t go back to my apartment
now those bloodhounds were on to me.
The idea was to stay at Artie Green; s
until I could make that bus for Ohio.
Once in Dayton,
l; d drop the credit boys a postcard
telling them
where to pick up the jalopy.
It was a great big
white elephant of a place.
The kind crazy movie people
built in the crazy twenties.
A neglected house
gets an unhappy look.
This one had it in spades.
It was like that old woman
in; ; Great Expectations; ;,
that Miss Havisham in her rotting
wedding dress and her torn veil,
taking it out on the world
because she; d been given the go-by.
You there, why are you so late?
Why have you kept me waiting so long?
In here.
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought...
- Go on in.
- Maybe I'd better take my car...
Wipe your feet.
Go on.
You're not properly dressed for the occasion.
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.
- Up the stairs.
- Listen for a minute...
- Madame is waiting.
- For me?
OK.
If you need help with the coffin, call me.
This way.
In here.
I put him on my massage table by the fire.
He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick.
We'll bury him in the garden.
Any city laws against that?
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care, anyway.
I want the coffin to be white and specially lined with satin, white or deep pink.
Maybe red, bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.
How much? Don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Lady, you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with a flat tyre.
I pulled in till I could get a spare.
I thought the house was empty.
- It is not. Get out.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you lost your friend.
I don't think red is the right colour.
- Haven't I seen you before?
- Get out, or shall I call my servant?
You're Norma Desmond.
You were big in silent pictures.
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
They're dead, they're finished.
There was a time when they had the eyes of the world.
But that wasn't good enough.
They had to have the ears, too.
So they opened their big mouths and out came talk, talk, talk!
That's where the popcorn business comes in. Buy it to plug your ears.
Look at them in the front offices, the masterminds!
They smashed the idols!
The Fairbankses, the Gilberts, the Valentinos!
Who've we got now? Some nobody.
Don't blame me. I'm just a writer.
You are? Writing words, words, more words.
You've made a rope of words and strangled this business.
But there's a microphone to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the swollen tongue.
- Sh! You'll wake up the monkey.
- Get out! Max.
Next time
I'll bring my autograph album.
Or maybe some cement and ask for your footprint.
It's OK, OK. I'm going.
Just a minute, you.
You're a writer, you said.
- Why?
- Are you or not?
- That's what's on my Guild card.
- And you have written pictures?
I sure have. Want a list of my credits?
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.
Last one was about
Okies in the Dust Bowl.
You'd never know because on screen the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Intimate, isn't it?
The wind gets in that pipe organ.
I ought to take it out.
I'd teach it a better tune.
Young man, tell me something.
How long is a movie script these days? How many pages?
Depends whether it's "Donald Duck" or "Joan of Arc".
This is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.
Looks like enough for six important pictures.
It's Salome's story.
I'll have DeMille direct.
- DeMille?
- We made a lot of pictures together.
- And you'll play Salome.
- Who else?
I didn't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word. It's a return.
A return to the millions who've never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
- Fair enough.
- Salome. What a woman.
What a part. The princess in love with a holy man.
She dances the dance of the seven veils.
He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray.
Kissing his cold, dead lips.
- They'll love it in Pomona.
- They'll love it everyplace.
Read the scene just before she has him killed.
Another writer may steal your material.
I'm not afraid. Read it.
Bring something to drink.
Sit down. Is there enough light?
- I've got 20-20 vision.
- I said sit down.
Well, I had no
pressing engagement.
Except with those boys
from the finance office.
And she; d mentioned
something to drink. Why not?
Sometimes it; s interesting to see
just how bad bad writing can be.
This promised to go the limit.
What would a handwriting expert
make of her childish scrawl?
Max wheeled in
some champagne and caviar.
Later I found out Max was the only
other person in that grim castle.
And I found out
a few other things about him.
As for her, she sat coiled up
like a watch-spring,
her cigarette clamped
in a curious holder.
I could sense her watching me
through those dark glasses,
defying me not to like what I read,
or maybe begging me
in her own proud way to like it.
It meant so much to her.
It sure was a cosy set-up.
That bundle of raw nerves and Max
and a dead monkey upstairs,
and the wind wheezing through
that organ once in a while.
Later on, just for comedy relief,
the real guy arrived
with the baby coffin.
It was all done with great dignity.
He must have been
a very important chimp.
The great-grandson
of King Kong maybe.
It got to be eleven, and I felt
a little sick at my stomach,
what with that sweet champagne
and that tripe l; d been reading,
that silly hodgepodge
of melodramatic plots.
However, by then, l; d started
concocting a little plot of my own.
- Well?
- This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and repetitious, but you're not a professional writer.
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.
That's what makes it great.
- But it needs a little more dialogue.
- What for?
- My eyes can say anything I want.
- It could use some shears.
- I will not have it butchered.
- Of course not.
But it ought to be organised, edited.
You can find somebody.
Who? I'd have to have somebody I could trust.
When were you born?
What zodiac sign?
- I don't know.
- What month?
December, 21 st.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians, you can trust them.
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.
Me? I'm busy. I just finished a script and I'm doing another assignment.
I don't care.
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get $500 a week.
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.
- I'll read the rest at home.
- I couldn't let it out of my house.
- Finish it here.
- It's getting kind of late.
- Are you married, Mr?
- Gillis. Single.
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido apartments.
- Something's wrong with your car?
- There sure is.
- Why not stay here?
- I'll come back early tomorrow.
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.
Max will take you there.
Max!
I felt kind of pleased
with the way l; d handled the situation.
I dropped the hook,
and she snapped at it.
My car would be safe down below
while I patched up the script.
And there should be
plenty of money in it.
This room hasn't been used for a long time.
It'll never make "House Beautiful", but it's OK for one night.
- I made your bed this afternoon.
- How did you know I'd stay?
The bathroom's there. I put in some towels, soap and a toothbrush.
Say, she's quite a character that Norma Desmond.
She was the greatest.
You wouldn't know, you're too young.
In one week, she received 17,000 fan letters.
Men bribed the hairdresser for a lock of her hair.
There was an Indian maharajah who came to beg one of her stockings.
Later he strangled himself with it.
Well, I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
You did, sir. Goodnight, sir.
I pegged him as slightly cuckoo, too.
A stroke maybe.
The whole place seemed stricken
with a creeping paralysis,
out of beat with the rest of the world,
crumbling apart in slow motion.
There was a tennis court,
or rather the ghost of a tennis court,
with faded markings
and a sagging net.
And, of course, she had a pool.
Who didn; t then?
Mabel Normand and John Gilbert
swam in it 10,000 midnights ago.
And Vilma Banky
and Rod La Rocque.
It was empty now. Or was it?
There was something else going on:
the last rites for that hairy old chimp,
performed
with the utmost seriousness,
as if she were laying to rest
an only child.
Was her life really as empty as that?
It was all very queer,
but queerer things were yet to come.
That night I had a mixed-up dream.
In it there was an organ grinder.
I couldn; t see his face,
but the organ was draped in black.
And a chimp
was dancing for pennies.
When I opened my eyes,
the music was still there.
Where was I?
Oh, yes, in that empty room
over her garage.
Only it wasn; t empty any more.
l; d had a visitor.
Someone had brought in my belongings,
my books, typewriter and clothes.
What was going on?
Hey, you! Max, whatever your name is, what are my things doing here?
I'm talking to you. My clothes and things are up in the room.
Naturally. I brought them myself.
- Is that so?
- What's the matter? Anything missing?
- Who asked you to?
- I did.
I don't know why you're so upset.
Stop that playing, Max.
It seemed like a good idea if we are to work together.
I'm to fix your script. There's nothing in the deal about staying here.
- You'll like it here.
- I've my own apartment.
You owe three months' rent.
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, all paid for.
We'll deduct it from my salary.
Let's not be small about such matters.
We won't keep books.
- Unpack Mr Gillis's things.
- It is done, Madame.
- Pack 'em up again. I'm not staying!
- Make up your mind.
Do you want this job or don't you?
I wanted the job and the dough
and to get out of there quickly.
I thought if I got going
I could finish it in a couple of weeks.
But it wasn; t so simple getting
coherence into her wild hallucinations.
It was made tougher with her
around all the time, hovering over me,
afraid l; d do injury
to that precious brainchild of hers.
What's that?
- Just a scene I threw out.
- Which scene?
The slave market.
It's better to cut directly to...
Cut away from me?
It's too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.
Then why do they still write me fan letters and beg for my photographs?
Because they want to see me - me, Norma Desmond.
Put it back.
OK.
I didn; t argue with her.
You don; t yell at a sleepwalker.
He may fall and break his neck.
That; s it. She was still sleepwalking
along the giddy heights of a lost career.
Plain crazy when it came
to that one subject: her celluloid self.
The great Norma Desmond.
How could she breathe in that house
so crowded with Norma Desmonds?
More Norma Desmonds
and still more Norma Desmonds.
It wasn; t all work, of course.
Three times a week,
Max hauled up that painting
presented to her by some
Nevada chamber of commerce.
And we; d see a movie,
right in her living room.
So much nicer than going out,
she; d say.
The plain fact was
she was afraid of that world outside,
afraid it would remind her
that time had passed.
They were silent movies, and Max
would run the projection machine.
Just as well.
It kept him from giving us
an accompaniment on that organ.
She; d sit very close to me,
and she; d smell of tuberoses.
Not my favourite perfume,
not by a long shot.
Sometimes as we watched,
she; d clutch my arm or my hand,
forgetting she was my employer,
just becoming a fan, excited about
that actress up there on the screen.
I don; t have to tell you
who the star was.
They were always her pictures.
That; s all she wanted to see.
Still wonderful, isn't it?
And no dialogue.
We didn't need dialogue.
We had faces.
There just aren't any faces like that any more. Maybe one, Garbo.
Those idiot producers, those imbeciles!
Haven't they got eyes?
Have they forgotten what a star looks like?
I'll be up there again, so help me!
Sometimes there; d be
a little bridge game.
With a twentieth of a cent a point.
l; d get half her winnings.
Once they ran up to 70 cents, which
was about the only cash I ever got.
The other players
would be actor friends,
dim figures you may still remember
from the silent days.
I thought of them as her waxworks.
- One diamond.
- One heart.
- A spade.
- Pass.
- Three no trump.
- Pass.
- Pass.
- Empty the ashtray, Joe, dear.
- Some men outside ask for you.
- I'm not here.
- That's what I said.
- Good.
But they found your car and they're going to tow it away.
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
I've forgotten how many spades are out!
- I need money now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?
- No.
- Please.
- Now, what is it? Where's the fire?
- I've lost my car.
I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is, to me. That's why I came to this house and took this job, ghost-writing.
You're being silly. We don't need two cars, we have one.
Not a cheap thing made of chromium and spit: an Isotta Fraschini.
Ever heard of Isotta Fraschinis?
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.
So Max got that old bus
off its blocks and polished it up.
She; d take me for rides
in the hills above Sunset.
The whole thing
was upholstered in leopard skin,
and had one of those car phones,
all gold-plated.
- That's a dreadful shirt.
- What's wrong with it?
Nothing, for work in a filling station.
I'm bored with that jacket and pants.
Max, what's the very best man's shop in town?
I don't need any clothes and
I don't want you buying them for me.
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.
And must you chew gum?
There's nothing like blue flannel for a man.
This one, single-breasted.
Now we need a topcoat.
Show me your camel's hair.
- Evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do. A tuxedo, tails and, if you aren't careful, a cut-away.
- Tails, that's ridiculous!
- For parties and New Year's Eve.
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, madam.
Here are some camel's hair, but feel this, it's vicu馻.
- It's a little more expensive.
- The camel's hair will do.
Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicu馻?
The last week in December,
the rains came.
A great package of rain. Oversized
like everything else in California.
It came right through the old roof
of my room above the garage.
She had Max move me
to the main house.
I didn; t much like the idea.
The only time
I had to myself was in that room.
But, it was better than sleeping
in a raincoat and galoshes.
- Whose room was this?
- The room of the husband.
The husbands, I should say.
Madame's been married three times.
I guess that's the one you can see
Catalina from, only this isn't the day.
What's with the door?
There's no lock.
There are no locks anywhere in this house, sir.
How come? There must be a reason.
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?
Madame's doctor. Madame has moments of melancholy.
There have been some attempts at suicide.
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.
We shut off the gas in Madame's bedroom.
Why? Her career? She got enough out of it. She's not forgotten.
- She still gets those fan letters.
- Don't look closely at the postmarks.
You send them. Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.
Mr Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?
No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.
There it was again.
That room of hers.
All satin and ruffles.
And that bed like a gilded rowboat.
The perfect setting
for a silent movie queen. Poor devil.
Still waving proudly to a parade
which had long since passed her by.
It was at her New Year; s party that
I found out how she felt about me.
Maybe l; d been an idiot
not to have sensed it was coming.
That sad, embarrassing revelation.
Joe!
You look absolutely divine.
Turn around.
- Please!
- Come on.
Perfect! Wonderful shoulders, and I love that line.
- It's padding, don't be fooled.
- Here.
Dressing up was always just wearing my dark blue suit.
I don't like the stud.
I want you to have a luscious pearl.
I'm not going to wear earrings.
- Let's have a drink.
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Max, champagne.
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
Here's to us! This floor used to be wood, but I had it changed.
Valentino said, "There's nothing like tile for a tango." Come on.
- Not on the same floor with Valentino.
- Just follow me.
- Don't bend back like that.
- It's that thing, it tickles.
It does?
- It's 10.15. What time will they arrive?
- Who?
- The other guests.
- There aren't any.
We don't want to share this night with others. This is for you and me.
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.
OK.
Come midnight, how about smashing glasses over Max's head?
- You think this is funny.
- A little.
An hour dragged by.
I felt caught like the cigarette
in that contraption on her finger.
What a wonderful next year it's going to be. What fun we'll have.
I'll fill the pool or open my Malibu house and you can have the ocean.
When our picture's finished, I'll buy you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii...
You won't buy me anything more.
Don't be silly. Here. I was going to give it to you at midnight.
I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.
Shut up! I'm rich, richer than all this new Hollywood trash.
I've got $1 million.
I own three blocks downtown, I've got oil in Bakersfield pumping, pumping.
It's for buying us anything we want.
- Cut out that "us" business.
- What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? You want me to tell you?
Have you thought I may have a life of my own, a girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car-hop or dress extra?
I'm all wrong for you.
You want a Valentino, somebody with polo ponies, a big shot.
What you're trying to say is you don't want me to love you. Say it.
I didn; t know where I was going.
I just had to get out of there.
I had to be with people my own age.
I had to hear somebody laugh again.
I thought of Artie Green.
There had to be a New Year; s
shindig in his apartment.
Writers without a job,
composers without a publisher,
actresses so young they still
believed the guys in the casting office.
A bunch of kids who didn; t give a hoot,
so long as they had a yuck to share.
Hollywood for us ain; t been so good
Got no swimming pool
Very few clothes
All we earn are buttons and bows
- Hello, Joe.
- Tom.
- How are you?
- Hi, Joe.
- Whaddya know, Joe Gillis!
- Hi, Artie.
Where you been keeping that gorgeous face? I almost reported you missing.
You all know Joe Gillis, the famous screenwriter, uranium smuggler, and Black Dahlia suspect.
- Give me your coat.
- Let it ride.
- You are going to stay?
- Yes.
Then come on. What is this, mink?
Judas H Priest, who'd you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
- Close, but no cigar.
- You're not really a smuggler?
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.
- Good party.
- The greatest.
They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.
Go easy on that punchbowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra.
- Fake the rest.
- Can I stick around a while?
- Sure. This'll go on all night.
- No, I mean a couple of weeks?
- We've a vacancy on the couch.
- I'll take it.
I'll have the bellhop take care of your luggage. Just register it here.
- Hello, Mr Gillis.
- Hello.
- You know each other?
- Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.
- Sure, "Bases Loaded".
- Wait.
This is the woman I love.
What's going on?
She's a fan for my literary output.
- Hurt feelings department.
- Where's the phone?
Over by the rainbow room.
When you're through with that thing, can I have it?
- Hey, you forgot this.
- Thanks.
- I've been hoping to run into you.
- To recover your knife in my back?
I felt guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
- You sweet kid.
- One's called something "Window".
- "Dark Windows". How'd you like it?
- I didn't, except for about six pages.
You've got a flashback there...
Is there someplace we can talk?
How about the rainbow room?
Joe, I said you could have my couch, not my girl.
This is shop talk.
There's a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice?
The flashback scene when she tells about being a schoolteacher.
- I had a teacher like that.
- Maybe that's why it's good.
- It's true and moving. Why not?
- Who wants true and moving?
Drop that attitude.
It's something worthwhile.
- Shall I start now?
- Seriously. I've got ideas.
I've got some, too.
This is New Year's Eve, let's live it up.
For instance? We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.
- Or turn on the shower full blast.
- Or capture the kitchen.
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?
After twelve years in the Burmese jungle, I'm starving, Lady Agatha...
...starving for a white shoulder.
- Phillip, you're mad.
Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.
You can have the phone now.
No, Phillip, we must be strong.
You're still wearing the Coldstream Guards uniform, furthermore, you can have the phone now.
OK.
Suddenly
I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this horrible liquid.
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful.
Hello, Max. I need a favour.
I'm sorry, I cannot talk now.
Yes, you can. Put my old clothes and my typewriter in my suitcase.
- I'll have somebody pick them up.
- I've no time. The doctor is here.
What doctor? What's going on?
Madame got the razor from your room and cut her wrists.
What? Max! Max!
I got the recipe.
Two packages of cough drops dissolved in warm grape juice...
Hey, Joe!
Happy New Year!
- How is she?
- She's in her room.
Be careful, don't race upstairs.
The musicians mustn't know.
Go away.
What silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you was the idiotic thing.
Sure would've made attractive headlines.
"Great star kills herself for unknown writer."
Great stars have great pride.
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.
Look, I was making that up, because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.
You're the only person in this stinking town that has.
Just say thank you and go.
Go, go!
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again. I'll do it again!
I'll do it again.
Happy New Year, Norma.
Happy New Year, darling.
- Hello.
- Is this Crest View 51733?
I'm sorry to bother you again, but I must speak to Mr Gillis.
- He's not here.
- Where can I reach him?
- Maybe somebody else could tell me.
- Nobody can give you any information.
And you will please not call again.
Max!
Who was it, Max? What is it?
Nothing, Madame. Somebody enquiring about a stray dog.
Our number must be similar to the number of the pound.
Wait. Get the car out and take the script to Paramount.
- Deliver it to Mr DeMille in person.
- Very good.
- You're sending it to DeMille?
- Yes. This is the day.
My astrologer read
DeMille's horoscope and mine.
- She read the script?
- DeMille's Leo, I'm Scorpio.
Mars has been transiting
Jupiter for weeks.
Today is the day of the greatest conjunction.
Turn around, darling. Let me dry you.
I hope you realise scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
It's not the script, I'm selling me.
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.
When did he say it, Norma?
All right, it was quite a few years ago.
But I've never looked better in my life.
You know why? Because
I've never been as happy in my life.
A few evenings later, we were visiting
one of the waxworks for bridge.
She; d taught me bridge by then, just
as she; d taught me fancy tango steps,
and what wine to drink with what fish.
That idiot! He forgot to fill my cigarette case.
- Have one of mine.
- They're dreadful and make me cough.
Pull up at the drugstore.
I'll get you some.
You're a darling.
Give me a package of those
Turkish cigarettes... Abdullas.
Stick 'em up, Gillis, or I'll let you have it.
Hi, Artie. Evening, Miss Schaefer.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You walked out on the mob?
Sorry about New Year's. Would you believe I stayed with a sick friend?
Someone in the formal set, with a ten-carat kidney stone?
Stop it. Where've you been keeping yourself?
- I've got wonderful news for you.
- I haven't been keeping myself at all.
I called your agent, the Screenwriters' Guild.
Your apartment gave me a Crest View number.
There was someone with an accent growling: you weren't there, they never heard of you.
Is that so?
What's the wonderful news?
- Sheldrake likes the teacher angle.
- What teacher?
"Dark Windows". He thinks it could be made into something.
- Where's the cash?
- Where's the story?
I bluffed it out with a few notions.
- But it needs work.
- I feared so.
I've got 20 pages and a good male character.
Write plenty of background so they'll need an extra director.
Shut up.
If we could get a story...
I've given up writing on spec.
- But this is half sold.
- In fact, I've given up writing.
- Mr Gillis, if you please?
- I'll be right there.
The accent! This guy's in the pay of a foreign government.
- Check those studs and cufflinks.
- I must go.
- Thanks for the interest in my career.
- It's not yours, it's mine.
I'd hoped to get in on this deal.
I don't want to be a reader.
I want to write.
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have.
So long.
- It took you hours.
- I ran into some people I know.
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your?
Norma, you're smoking too much.
Whenever she suspected
I was getting bored,
she; d put on a live show for me.
The Norma Desmond Follies.
Her first number was always
the Mack Sennett Bathing Beauty.
I can still see myself in the line:
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.
Mabel was always stepping on my feet.
What's the matter?
Why are you so glum?
Nothing's the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.
All right. Give me this. I need it for a moustache. Now, close your eyes.
Something was the matter all right.
I was thinking about that girl
of Artie; s, that Miss Schaefer.
She was like all writers
when we first hit Hollywood,
itching with ambition,
planning to get your names up there:
; ; Screenplay by; ;, ; ; Original story by;; .
Audiences don; t know somebody
sits down and writes a picture.
They think the actors
make it up as they go.
Open your eyes.
- Madame's wanted on the telephone.
- Don't interrupt me.
- Paramount's calling.
- Who?
Paramount Studios.
Now do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.
It is not Mr DeMille in person, it's someone named Gordon Cole.
- He says it's very important.
- Certainly it is.
Important enough for Mr DeMille to call me personally.
The idea of having some assistant call me! Say I'm busy and hang up.
Very good, Madame.
How do you like that?
We've made 12 pictures together.
His greatest successes!
- Maybe he's busy shooting.
- I know that trick!
He's trying to belittle me, to get my price down.
I've waited 20 years for this.
DeMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
About three days later,
she was good and ready.
Incredibly, there; d been some more
of those urgent calls
from Paramount.
So she put on about half a pound
of make-up, fixed it up with a veil,
and set forth
to see DeMille in person.
Madame will pardon me, the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Thank you, Max.
Hold that noise!
- Hey!
- To see Mr DeMille, open the gate.
He's shooting. Got an appointment?
No appointment necessary.
- I'm bringing Norma Desmond.
- Norma who?
- Norma Desmond.
- Jonesy, hey, Jonesy.
Yeah? Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!
- How've you been, Miss Desmond?
- Open the gate.
- Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on.
- They can't enter without a pass.
Miss Desmond can. Come on.
- Where's Mr DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18.
Thank you, Jonesy.
And teach your friend some manners.
Without me he'd have no job, because there'd be no Paramount.
- You're right, Miss Desmond.
- Go on, Max.
Stage 18.
All right, notify Henry Wilcoxon.
Spread that out so I can see it.
Keep quiet back there!
Norma Desmond's coming to see Mr DeMille.
Hit that with a light, somebody,
so I can get a look at that scape.
Back up a little. Get out of the way!
You fellow at the back.
Norma Desmond's coming to see Mr DeMille.
Norma Desmond?
- Wait a minute.
- Harry Wilcoxon?
Draw your sword and raise that drape with it. Samson's lying over here.
Norma Desmond's coming in to see you, Mr DeMille.
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.
Where does that put me?
I could be her father.
- Sorry, Mr DeMille.
- It must be about her awful script.
What can I tell her?
I can tell her you're in the projection room, give her the brush.
Thirty million fans gave her the brush. Isn't that enough?
- I didn't mean...
- Of course not.
You didn't know Norma Desmond as a lovely girl of 17, with more courage and wit and heart than ever in one youngster.
- I hear she was a terror to work with.
- Only toward the end.
A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.
Hold it.
- Don't you want to come along?
- It's your script, your show.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, dearest.
Well, hello, young fellow.
- Hello, Mr DeMille.
- Good to see you.
I saw you last someplace very gay.
I remember I was dancing on a table.
A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris. Come on in.
Norma, I must apologise for not calling you.
You'd better, I'm very angry.
- You can see I'm terribly busy.
- That's no excuse.
- You read the script, of course?
- Yes.
You could've called me yourself, instead of leaving it to an assistant.
- What assistant?
- Don't play innocent. Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
If you hadn't been pretty interested, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the telephone ten times.
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
Why don't you sit in my chair and make yourself comfortable?
- Thank you.
- That's the girl. I won't be a moment.
Bring me a telephone and get me Gordon Cole.
Hey, Miss Desmond.
- Miss Desmond, it's me, Hog-eye.
- Hello, Hog-eye.
Let's get a good look at you.
Look, there's Norma Desmond.
Norma Desmond!
- Norma Desmond!
- I thought she was dead.
- How nice to see you!
- Welcome home. Remember me?
Of course I do. Hello, Patsy.
- Have you met Miss Desmond?
- It's a great pleasure.
Gordon, this is C B DeMille. Have you been calling Norma Desmond?
Yes, Mr DeMille. It's that car of hers, an old Isotta Fraschini.
Her chauffeur drove it here the other day. It's perfect for the Crosby picture.
- We want to rent it for two weeks.
- Oh, I see.
Well, thank you very much, thank you.
Hog-eye, turn that light back where it belongs.
Well, I got hold of Gordon Cole.
Did you see how they came?
You know, some crazy things happen in this business, Norma.
I hope you haven't lost your sense of humour.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I didn't realise what it would be like coming back to the studio.
- I'd no idea how much I missed it.
- We've missed you, too.
We'll be working again.
We'll make our greatest picture.
- I want to talk to you about that.
- Isn't it a good script?
It has some good things in it, but it would be a very expensive picture.
I don't care.
I want to work again. You don't know what it means knowing you want me.
Nothing would please me more if it were possible.
Remember, I don't work before
10 a.m. and never after 4.30 p.m.
- We're ready, Mr DeMille.
- All right.
Why don't you sit here and watch?
Pictures have changed quite a bit.
All right, let's go.
Hit 'em all.
Roll 'em. Speed.
You see those offices there, Mr Gillis?
They used to be Madame's dressing-room. The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.
I had the upstairs. You see where it says "Readers Department"?
I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Here's that funny car Cole was talking about. Can we look it over?
What's so funny about it?
If there's anything in "Dark Windows" you can use, take it, it's all yours.
For heaven's sakes!
Come in, have a chair.
- I mean it. Help yourself.
- Why should you do that?
You get $100,000, buy me chocolates; an Oscar, I get the left foot.
I would do that, but I'm not good enough to do it alone.
- What about those ideas you had?
- See if they make sense.
First, throw out all that psychological mess, exploring the killer's sick mind.
Psychopaths sell like hot cakes.
This is a story about teachers, their threadbare lives.
She teaches day classes while he teaches night school.
The first time they meet...
- I haven't time to listen.
- I'll make it short.
- It's your baby.
- Couldn't we work evenings?
Six in the morning? This month
I'm completely at your disposal.
- Artie's out of town.
- What's Artie to do with it?
- We're engaged.
- Good for you.
- You couldn't find a nicer guy.
- I agree.
They're on location in Arizona making a Western.
I'm free every evening and weekend.
We could work at your place.
It can't be done. Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
- I hate you.
- Don't make it too dreary.
How about this? She teaches daytimes, he teaches at night.
They don't know each other but share a room. It's cheaper.
They sleep in the same bed.
In shifts, of course.
Are you kidding? I think it's good.
- So do I.
- Let me show you where it fits in.
- So long.
- Oh, you...
What?
I found out the reason for those telephone calls from Paramount.
It's not Madame they want, it's her car they want to rent.
What?
Goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.
I'm not worried. The old team together again. Nothing can stop us.
The old team? Yeah.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr DeMille.
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.
He has to finish this picture first.
Mine will be next.
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.
Say he can get another old car someplace.
I'll buy him five old cars if necessary.
After that, an army of beauty experts
invaded her house
on Sunset Boulevard.
She went through
a merciless series of treatments.
Like an athlete training for the Olympics,
she counted every calorie,
went to bed every night at nine.
She was absolutely
determined to be ready,
ready for those cameras
that would never turn.
- Darling, are you there?
- Yes.
Don't turn around.
Keep your eyes on the book.
I just came to say goodnight.
You mustn't see me.
- I'm not very attractive.
- Goodnight.
- I've lost half a pound.
- Good.
I was worried about my throat.
This woman's done wonders.
- Good.
- You'd better get to bed yourself.
- I think I'll read a little longer.
- You went out last night, didn't you?
- Why do you say that?
- I know.
I had a nightmare and screamed for you. Where were you?
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.
I drove to the beach. You don't want me to feel I'm locked up here?
Of course not.
I just don't want to be left alone.
Not while I'm under this strain.
My nerves are torn to shreds.
All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
- I haven't done anything.
- Of course you haven't.
I wouldn't let you. Goodnight, darling.
Yes, I was playing hookey
every evening along in there.
It reminded me of being twelve,
sneaking out to see a gangster film.
This time, it wasn; t to see a picture,
it was to try and write one.
That story Betty Schaefer dug up
kept going through my head
like a dozen locomotives.
So we started working on it,
nights when the studio was deserted,
up in her little cubby-hole of an office.
I got the funniest letter from Artie.
It's rained every day since they got there.
They rewrote the whole picture for rain and shot half.
Now the sun's out, nobody knows when they'll get back.
- Good.
- Why good? I miss him terribly.
- I mean this good dialogue will play.
- It will?
Sure, especially with lots of music drowning it out.
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.
In all seriousness, this is really good.
- It's fun writing with you.
- Oh, thanks.
- Who's Norma?
- Who's who?
I'm sorry, I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine.
A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I'll say, this is solid gold.
I gave her advice on an idiotic script.
The old familiar story. You help a timid soul across a crowded street.
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire and leaves you all her money.
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.
Now suppose you proofread page ten while the water boils, OK?
OK.
Sometimes when we got stuck,
we; d make a little tour
of the drowsing lot.
Not talking much, just wandering
down alleys between the stages,
or through the sets they were getting
ready for the next day; s shooting.
In fact, it was on one of those walks
when she told me about her nose.
Look at this street.
All cardboard, all hollow, all phoney, all done with mirrors.
I like it better than any street in the world.
Maybe because
I used to play here when I was a kid.
Were you a child actress?
No, I was born two blocks from the studio, Lemon Grove Avenue.
My father was head electrician here.
Mother still works in wardrobe.
- Second generation, huh?
- Third.
Grandma did stunt work for Pearl
White. I'm from a picture family.
They expected me to become a star.
So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
Then the studio made a test.
They didn't like my nose.
Slanted this way a little.
So I had it fixed.
Then they loved my nose, only they didn't like my acting.
- Nice job.
- It should be, it cost $300.
- That's sad.
- Not at all.
It taught me sense. I worked up from the mail room to being reader.
Come clean. At night you weep for the lost close-ups, those galas.
Not once. What's wrong with being the other side of the cameras?
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer.
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.
May I say that you smell real special?
- Must be my new shampoo.
- That's no shampoo.
It's more like freshly laundered linen handkerchiefs, like a brand-new automobile.
- How old are you?
Smart girl. Nothing like being 22.
May I suggest, if we're ever to finish this story, stay at least two feet away.
The first time you see me coming any closer, clunk me on the head with a shoe.
Now, back to the typewriters, by way of Washington Square.
What is it, Max?
Want to wash the car?
Or are you spying in your off hours?
Be careful as you cross the patio.
Madame may be watching.
How about going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark?
I'm not enquiring where Mr Gillis goes every night.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm going to finish it!
It's just that I am greatly worried about Madame.
Sure you are.
And we're not helping her any.
Feeding her lies and more lies, getting herself ready for a picture.
- What happens when she finds out?
- She never will.
That is my job and it has been for a long time.
Understand, I discovered her when she was sixteen. I made her a star.
I cannot let her be destroyed.
- You made her a star?
- Yes, I directed all her early films.
There were three young directors who showed promise in those days.
D W Griffith, Cecil B DeMille and Max Von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.
I could've continued my career, only I found everything unendurable after she'd left me.
You see, I was her first husband.
You're here, Joe.
When did you come home?
Oh, Joe, where were you?
Is it a woman?
I know it's a woman. Who is she?
Why can't I ask you?
I must know.
What's the matter?
Betty, wake up.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight?
- What is it?
- Something came up.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?
I just don't.
What have you heard?
Come on, let's have it.
Is it about me?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.
Let's face it, whatever it is.
- I got a telegram from Artie.
- From Artie? What's wrong?
He wants me to come on to Arizona.
He says it only costs two dollars to get married there.
It would save us a honeymoon.
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
Stop crying. You're getting married.
That's what you wanted.
I don't want it now.
- Why not, don't you love Artie?
- Course I love him. I always will.
I'm not in love with him any more, that's all.
What happened?
You did.
It wasn; t until I got back
to my peculiar prison
that I started facing the facts.
There it was. Betty Schaefer; s future
right in the palm of my hand.
Betty Schaefer engaged to Artie
Green, as nice a guy as ever lived,
and she was in love with me - me.
She was a fool not to sense there
was something phoney in my set-up.
I was a heel not to have told her.
But you just can; t say those things
to somebody you; re crazy about.
Maybe I could get away with it,
get away from Norma.
Maybe I could wipe
the whole nasty mess out of my life.
Hello, is this Gladstone 9281?
May I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
She must be home by now.
Hey, Betty, here's that weird-sounding woman again.
Well, what is this anyway?
This is Betty Schaefer.
Forgive me for calling so late, but I feel it's my duty.
It's about Mr Gillis.
You do know Mr Gillis?
Exactly how much do you know about him?
Do you know where he lives, how he lives, what he lives on?
Who are you? What do you want?
What business is it of yours?
Miss Schaefer,
I'm trying to do you a favour and spare you a great deal of misery.
You may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort.
I don't know what he's said, but he does not live with relatives, nor with friends in the usual sense of the word.
Ask him. Ask him again.
That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe.
Joe, where are you?
What is this all about?
Better yet, come out and see for yourself.
The address is
10086 Sunset Boulevard.
Don't hate me, Joe.
I did it because I need you.
I need you as I've never needed you before. Look at me.
Look at my hands, my face, under my eyes.
How can I work if I'm wasting away under this torment?
You don't know what I've been through these last weeks.
I bought a revolver. I stood in front of that mirror, but I couldn't do it.
Don't just stand there hating me.
Shout at me, strike me, but don't hate me.
Say you don't hate me, Joe.
Here's 10079, Connie.
It must be over there.
- Betty, let me come with you.
- No, I'll be all right.
I love you, Joe.
I love you, Joe.
I love you.
What are you going to do, Joe?
What are you going to do?
It's all right, Max. I'll take it.
Hello, Betty.
I'm so scared.
Is there something awful?
Come on in.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos?
That's from when they were making
$18,000 a week tax-free.
Careful of these tiles, they're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.
- Is this where you live?
- You bet.
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.
- Whose?
- Look around, there's a lot of her.
If you don't remember the face, you've heard the name. Norma Desmond?
- That was her on the phone?
- Drink?
There's always champagne, plenty of caviar.
- Why did she call me?
- Jealous.
Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.
And look at this.
Her own movie theatre.
I didn't come to see a house.
What about Norma Desmond?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is an enormous place.
Eight master bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every bathroom.
There's a bowling alley in the cellar.
It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion.
Very simple set-up.
Older woman who's well-to-do.
A younger man who's not doing too well.
- Can you figure it out?
- No.
- I'll give you a few more clues.
- No, I haven't heard any of this.
I never got those telephone calls and I've never been in this house.
Get your things and let's go.
All my things?
My 18 suits, my custom-made shoes, the six dozen shirts, the cufflinks, the platinum key-chains and the cigarette cases?
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on where?
To a one-room apartment
I can't pay for, to a story that may sell and very possibly won't?
- If you love me, Joe.
- Look, sweetie, be practical.
I've got a good deal here.
A long-term contract with no options.
I like it that way.
Maybe it's not very admirable.
Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
I can't look at you any more, Joe.
How about looking for the exit?
This way, Betty.
Good luck, Betty. You can finish that script on the way to Arizona.
When you and Artie get back, if you ever want a swim...
...here's the pool.
Thank you, darling. Thank you, Joe.
Joe.
May I come in, Joe?
I've stopped crying.
I'm all right again.
Tell me you're not cross.
Tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.
Joe.
What are you doing, Joe?
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.
- You're leaving me?
- Yes, I am, Norma.
No, you're not. Max! Max!
Thanks for the handsome wardrobe and for the use of all the trinkets.
- The rest's in the drawer.
- It's yours.
I'd take it, only it's too dressy for a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
These are nothing. You can have anything. What do you want?
Money?
You'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job any more.
You can't go. Max!
I can't face life without you.
- You know I'm not afraid to die.
- That's between you and yourself.
You think I made that up about the gun, don't you? All right.
See? You didn't believe me.
You don't think I have the courage?
- Sure, if it makes a good scene.
- You don't care.
Hundreds of thousands will!
You'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left years ago.
- That's a lie. They still want me.
- No, they don't.
- What about DeMille?
- He was sparing your feelings.
- The studio only wanted your car.
- What?
DeMille didn't have the heart to say. None of us has.
That's a lie. They want me.
I get letters every day.
You tell her, Max. Do her that favour.
Tell her there'll be no picture.
The only fan letters are the ones you write.
That isn't true. Max!
Madame is the greatest star of them all.
I will take Mr Gillis's bags to the car.
You heard him. I'm a star.
You're a woman of 50. Grow up.
There's nothing tragic about being 50, unless you try to be 25.
The greatest star of them all.
Goodbye, Norma.
No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star.
Joe! Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
The stars are ageless, aren't they?
Well, this is where you came in.
Back at that pool again.
The one I always wanted.
It; s dawn now and they must; ve
photographed me a thousand times.
Then they got a couple
of pruning hooks and fished me out
ever so gently.
Funny how gentle people
get with you once you; re dead.
They beached me
like a harpooned baby whale.
And started to check
the damage, just for the record.
The whole joint was jumping, cops,
reporters, neighbours, passers-by.
As much whoop-de-do as we get
when they open a supermarket.
Even the newsreel guys
came roaring in.
Here was an item
everybody could have some fun with.
The heartless so-and-sos.
What would they do to Norma?
Even if she got away with it in court,
crime of passion, temporary insanity,
those headlines would kill her.
; ; Forgotten star a slayer. ; ;
; ; Ageing actress. ; ;
; ; Yesterday; s glamour queen. ; ;
Coroner's office.
I want to speak to the coroner.
- Who's on this phone?
- I am. Get off!
This is more important.
"Times" city desk?
Hedda Hopper speaking.
I'm talking from
Norma Desmond's bedroom.
Don't bother with a rewrite.
Take it direct. Ready?
As day breaks over the murder house, Norma Desmond, famous star of yesteryear, is in a state of complete mental shock.
A curtain of silence surrounds her in the boudoir of her house on Sunset Boulevard...
Was it a sudden quarrel?
Had you had any trouble before?
How come this gun was right there?
This guy, where did you meet him?
Where did he come from?
Had you thought of doing something like this before?
Was theft involved? Did you catch him trying to steal something?
- The newsreel cameras are here.
- Tell them to go.
This is no time for cameras.
Now, Miss Desmond, is there anything you want to tell us?
Cameras? What is it, Max?
- The cameras have arrived.
- They have?
- Tell Mr DeMille I'll be right on set.
- What is this?
It's one way to get her downstairs.
Let's have the car right outside. OK.
- Everything will be ready, Madame.
- Thank you, Max.
Pardon me, gentlemen, but I must get ready for my scene.
- What's happening?
- Any statement?
Is there a confession?
- Everything set up?
- Just about.
- Lights ready?
- All set.
OK, fellas, hold it, hold it!
Quiet, everybody!
Lights.
Ready, Norma?
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the palace staircase.
Oh, yes, yes.
Down below they're waiting for the princess.
I'm ready.
All right. Cameras. Action!
So they were turning after all,
those cameras.
Life, which can be strangely merciful,
had taken pity on Norma Desmond.
The dream she had clung to
so desperately had enfolded her.
I can't go on with this scene,
I'm too happy.
Mr DeMille, do you mind if I say a few words? Thank you.
I want to say how happy I am to be in the studio making a picture again.
You don't know how I've missed you.
I'll never desert you again.
Because after "Salome" we'll make another picture and another.
You see, this is my life.
It always will be. There's nothing else.
Just us and the cameras and those wonderful people out there in the dark.
All right, Mr DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
This is a district of Sao Paulo.
A large latin American industrial city...
...responsible for 60 to 70%...
...of this country's gross national product.
Brazil has 120 million inhabitants...
...of which, 50% are under 21 years of age.
Of these, almost 28 million...
...live in conditions below the standards set forth...
...in the International Childrens
Rights prescribed by the U.N.
There are also approximately
3 million homeless children...
...who have no one and no defined family of origin.
The situation of these children is more chaotic...
...when one is aware that they can't be prosecuted...
...which permits the exploitation of these minors by some adults.
Forcing them to commit crimes or acts of delinquency...
...knowing they won't be prosecuted.
At most they'll be sent to reformatories...
...where they will spend several months; where the pressure...
...and lack of space will cause their immediate release.
This district here, is one, wherein live...
...the families of workers from large neighboring factories...
...mom and dad who both work and children who remain at home...
...with care provided by an older sibling or a paid neighbor.
Fernando, who plays the main character of "Pixote"...
...lives with his mom and 9 other siblings in this house.
This film is acted by children who belong to this social class.
PIXOTE
The Survival of the Weakest
O.K. love, that's crazy!
- I've been waiting an hour.
Want me to give up the job?
- Just a minute longer, please.
I'll give you a call later on, okay? Bye.
My son has been missing for over a month.
That's another matter.
Just give me his name for now.
Jose Maria.
- Jose Maria, what?
- Jose Maria Da Silva.
Get moving, all of you!
- What's up?
- They're rounding everyone up.
Some old guy was killed, they're pinning it on us.
Pedro Socrates, 15 years old: father, Julio; mother, Ambrosia.
Diego Emanuel, 13, Marcelino dos Anjos, Father; unknown.
Joao Henrique, 10, Mother: Maria
Da Costa, 35; Father: unknown.
- My father's dead!
- Father: unknown!
Anastasio Pereira,
17 years old...
...Father, Roberval;
Mother, Severina.
Jose Altacilho: 16 years old.
Father, Fortunato; mother, Julia.
Edmundo Pires, alias Marilyn,
Parents: Luis, Esmeralda... 17.
Raimundo de Souza: Father, Pedro...
What a mess.
Everyone up.
Get in line.
Back again, eh? You know all about what's going on.
You don't get hit for no reason here.
Let's have some order here!
Inside you're a man, see?
Any trouble, and you'll answer to me.
- Any questions?
- No questions.
Sunday is visiting day.
No whores. Only family.
Get them to the dormitory.
Come on, quickly!
Quick!
Quiet!
Keep quiet!
It'll be O.K. if you keep quiet.
What the...?
I won't ask who's responsible!
No one will own up!
But hear this, I'm nobody's father!
I don't put up with any bullshit!
You want to kill each other, do it outside!
Not here or I take the rap
This is a respectable house.
You tell me everything, or,
I'll smash your heads in!
- Pixote, did you see who did it?
- Not me. I was asleep.
Fucking hell! Get him to sick bay.
You're gonna look pretty.
Watch out for Lilica.
Keep still! Got ants in your pants?
Hey! You're afraid.
Take a drag.
Breathe in and hold it.
Right on!
The smoke that satisfies.
Go again.
Shit, man, I'm so hungry.
I'm spaced out.
It doesn't get to an old hand like me so easily.
Let's split.
Pixote!
Fucking sexy chick!
My ass, she's a fag.
Lilica.
But I'd fuck it.
How's your memory?
That guy's Almir.
Son of a bitch cop.
You pushed an old guy under a car the other day. He's dead!
Did you need to do this...
...just to rob his wallet!
The guy was some judge.
Know what that means?
We sure fucked up.
How could we know he was important?
The Commissioner's got the screws on me.
The Chief Commissioner put the screws on the commissioner.
I want the names of who did it.
Nothing will happen to you.
Here, the law protects minors.
You're untouchable.
But I'm not taken in by this minors' business.
If you won't collaborate...
I'll just finger one of you, then where will you be?
The old man died in lpiranga and 24th, the 24th of May.
Who hangs out there?
The guy doesn't know anything.
He died at the block, not at the corner...
...like this jerk just said.
Talk faggot! Tell us!
Speak up, you whore!
Your lips are sealed, eh?
One good turn deserves another.
When we get out of here no one will stop us.
- Got it, pal?
- Got it.
Start scrubbing, you pigs.
Let's get this dirt off you.
Get rid of the lice.
And you, darling...
...get your pussy nice and clean.
What are you staring at?
You like it?
You want to touch it?
Sit here.
Are you new here?
Boy, I coughed all night!
Drink up, before it gets cold.
You'd better.
You'll only have to drink it tomorrow.
You're gonna be nice and strong when you grow up.
The...
...world...
...is...
...round...
...like...
...an...
...orange.
Have you written that?
Why aren't you writing?
0pen your book.
Too tired to do it?
Well, you must learn to write, to know things.
Come on, wake up, will you!
Start writing.
Fess up!
I know nothing.
Come clean, you son of a bitch!
How can I tell you what
I don't know, shit?
No swearing allowed here, asshole!
You'd better talk.
I can wait all day.
I'm in no hurry.
You'll tell us in the end, anyway. So talk!
0kay, okay, I'll talk.
It's like this...
...I met two guys on the street.
They asked me for a cigarette, and I gave 'em one.
- Marijuana, right?
- No, just a plain cigarette.
Then they asked me if I'd ever been involved in a hold-up.
I said, yes, and they gave me a gun, and we went to the bank.
There were two guys there...
...taking money out.
I'd like a loan.
- How much do you want
- Hand over the money!
- We need it.
There isn't much.
It's early.
What do you care? It isn't yours, hand it over.
- Quick, before someone comes!
- Please, don't kill me!
I'll blow you away!
In the bag, quick!
Stop, Dito!
Shit I quit playing!
Pixote screwed it all up.
He blurted out my name!
Piss off!
Cut it out. I've got something more interesting for you.
Naked women!
Imagine taking down her panties and putting it in her.
Pixote's blushing.
- Enough, that's not for kids.
- Shit, Lilica!
It's already hard.
There it is you jerk offs.
You act like big men but you have tiny weenies.
You, who are still on mother's milk, can do me a favor.
Stop it, only big boys can do that.
I need a little favor from you.
On Sunday your folks might bring me some...
- Don't want much, do you?
- I don't want any trouble.
It's easy for you, isn't it?
- Don't ask me!
- I know I could bring it.
But what's in it for me?
No one will rape you, nor beat you up.
We'll make sure of that.
Could you want more?
There's just one other thing.
- I want cash.
- Bug off, fairy.
Let's play soccer.
Think about it, eh?
I just told you I don't want trouble.
If you want a copy of today's message...
...ask for number 1,720 and for the theme...
...Jesus, the king who bestows happiness.
Go talk to the judge, mom.
I will son, but I'm sure he won't let you out.
What for? So you can go back on the streets again?
If anything happens to me in this hell hole...
...it'll be your fault.
What could happen?
If your Grandpa turns up, will you talk to him?
- I sure hope he doesn't!
- Why?
He pisses me off!
Come here, Roberto.
Today's my big day.
See Fumaca's mother?
Never misses a visit, you'd think she likes it here.
That's right.
Ugly old bat.
Looks like she brought him something.
Maybe it's coconut pie.
The last one she brought was great.
Dito, your mom wants to see you, c'mon.
I don't wanna see her!
- She came all this way to see you.
- I didn't ask her to!
C'mon, Sapato told me to get you.
Tell that cow I want nothing to do with her!
You won't talk to your mom?
Ingrate.
She sacrifices for you.
Now go see her.
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go on, Dito.
When did he arrive?
About 2 months ago, I guess.
- Almost kicked him to death.
- Why don't you ever come home?
- You don't turn me on anymore.
- I don't?
Ever since I was a kid...
...I did nothing but listen to you...
...I followed your story...
...I knew your glory...
...I knew by heart...
He's good. He really sounds like Roberto Carlos.
When he gets out he'll be a star.
And what about you?
Because I read...
...in those star magazines...
...that you had been...
...a poor kid like me.
But you know...
...I didn't need to be told that...
...because it was written all over your face...
...what you suffered, what you went through...
...and what you lost.
Look, I'm in a jam.
Can't you help me?
What sort of jam?
I need to get hold of a few joints.
What do you mean
"joints"?
Just a few.
I won't get you anything.
Don't make trouble.
You watch out for yourself, son.
I am...
...the Roberto Carlos of the poor.
I'm the boy who loved you and grew up...
...I sing where you no longer can.
That's the destiny life has given me.
Why can't you be like him?
I can't sing.
Besides, you'd have to get me out of here!
It's even worse out there.
Now, let's watch the singer.
Since you won't get me joints,
I'll look for my mom.
If you find her before I do, let me know.
In your footsteps...
...where you passed by.
- Keep still.
- Any other questions?
- Why did you leave home?
- Granny nagged me, so I left.
Look, I'm only trying to help you.
But you have to trust me.
Tell me everything.
If I do, you'll turn me over to the cops.
I'm not a cop.
I'm a doctor.
Promise you won't tell the judge?
I told you, I want you with the others.
- What is it?
- Transfer.
We don't have his evaluation yet.
Not my problem.
Let's go.
I still haven't told her everything.
If she doesn't know, how will the judge let me out?
There's another lady there.
Everything you said is kept confidential.
Go. 0bey, Mr. Sapato.
Almir, I don't want any trouble.
I want those kids back in 3 days.
Relax, I always bring them back.
Sure, but some of your colleagues haven't.
- And I take the rap.
- Don't panic.
If anyone asks, they're on vacation.
What are you looking at?
Get a move on.
Hurry!
Help!
No!
Help!
I don't know. Could be any of them.
I only remember he was a blond.
They all look the same.
How can I be sure?
You say he looked like that blond one?
He's already committed a homicide.
Could be, but I only saw him for a second.
I can't be certain.
It's him all right.
He's a wild one.
You seem certain.
I cannot be sure.
Let's go. It won't bring father back.
I know it's painful, but it's still part of our job.
What's your name, kid?
I like it.
Have you seen my son?
You know him?
Fumaca
Do you know where he is?
Is he sick?
Has something happened to him?
They took away a bunch of guys...
...and Fumaca hasn't returned yet.
You'd better inquire further.
Lady, better make yourself another son...
...Cause that one's had it!
The bodies of 2 boys, of about
14 to 15, have been found.
The victims were riddled with bulletholes.
The authorities are at this moment...
...going around to all city reform schools...
...the only clue was the drill uniforms they are wearing.
Let's go!
Quick!
Get dressed and out!
We have visitors. Keep your traps shut, or you're back here!
This is the dormitory wing.
We work miracles with our small budget.
That explains the conditions.
- Are the children locked up?
- No, it's not like that anymore.
This is our chief supervisor, he is dedicated to his boys.
Excuse the mess, it is difficult to clean all day long.
And that boy?
- Shouldn't he be in school?
- No, he is sick.
Infectious Hepatitis.
Son, how are you getting along here?
The doctor comes twice a week.
Did the mother see the boy in the infirmary, or not?
Sure she did
She said she'd been here Sunday.
She was told the boy had run away.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
I took her to the infirmary myself.
She was shocked, naturally...
...considering the state he was in.
She knew the police had been here and had taken the boy away.
But the police never returned.
When boys fight, they are worse than adults.
Could one boy attack another with such violence?
Only if he was King Kong.
When he's better, you can talk to him.
We'd like the press to spend some time here...
...to acknowledge the valuable work we do.
Pixote, you're here!
Where's Fumaca?
They took us away somewhere and worked him over.
- They said, he'd killed that old man.
- His mother was here on Sunday.
She blew up when she found out they'd taken Fumaca away.
She said she'd tell the papers.
It's gonna get rough.
So, Pixote, tell us everything.
Almir, that son of a bitch, drove off with some of the kids.
Carlinhos and Mirandinha, he killed them both.
Then he took us to the police station...
...and stuck us in solitary.
We were there for a long time.
Sapato came and took me out...
...and put me in fatigues.
- I gotta get out of here.
- Me too.
I saved a bit of glue for you.
When you're through, get rid of the can.
- Thanks.
- Let's split.
Hang in there, O.K.?
The boy is in fine shape.
If he doesn't eat well, he's gonna "kick it."
- Isn't that how they talk?
- It is.
Internal hemorrhage.
It's what I feared.
Weren't you caring for him?
How did this happen?
As if... you give me this boy all busted up.
I did everything I could.
Don't try to pin this on me!
Cad! This will cost you your job, I swear.
Did you have to turn the boy over?
I didn't turn him over.
The police came for him.
Scream at them. I had no part in it.
You accepted the boy in this condition?
It was on my day off.
- You accepted him, then?
- What should I have done?
Nothing! Nothing!!
What I want is for all of you to go to hell!
The press will come down on us like a ton of bricks!
God, this is the last thing we needed!
- What's the kid doing here?
- He's out of it.
He won't remember a thing.
I won't be blamed!
I will put the blame on you!
Make your own bed. Everybody has to pull together.
Come on, get dressed.
The doctor says you can go.
Snap to it.
Where's Fumaca?
He was in that bed.
That's nonsense, kid. I don't know any Fumaca.
Swallow this.
...drawn up by President
Figueiredo...
In Sao Paulo, violence on the streets increases daily...
...at dawn the body of LCB was found.
The Director of the Institute explained to our reporters:
Fights are frequent between the children...
...mostly due to their social background...
...as for the case of the minor who was found dead.
I have informed, that he had been brutally beaten up...
...by one of his colleagues...
...and that the attacker has been identified.
His assailant, A.C., 17, has a police record...
...of armed robbery, assault, and 1 homicide.
A typical juvenile delinquent.
I really don't know. I went and he wasn't there.
Then they told me he had run away.
Then when I went to visit him...
...they told me he was in the infirmary.
Then a boy told me it was a lie; that the police had got him.
I don't know. I just want my son.
I think this institution is pretty mysterious.
This reporter saw him in the infirmary in a terrible state.
He couldn't have taken a step.
So how could he have run away?
Everyone get to bed.
Shit, you want to destroy me?!
But it won't be like that.!
You scum, you think you can get rid of me?!
But you're wrong, you hear?!
That's quite enough for today!
Sapato, you son of a bitch,
I want to talk to you!
Everyone to the dormitory!
Everyone stay put!
Come on, I'm gonna bust your gut!
I'll cut you in pieces!
Sapato, you swine, get your ass here!
I didn't hurt Fumaca!
He was my friend!
It was you and your gang of friends!
You are stoned.
You want my hide!
Don't get carried away.
Even if you had done it, nothing will happen to you.
You'll be 18 soon and everything will be fine.
No one will bother you.
You don't even exist.
There will be nothing on your record.
I wasn't even on duty yesterday.
Keep cool, and everything will work out.
Now, everybody get to bed!
- Why the rush?
- Let me go! You want my hide!
What's going on?
Who's there?
What have they done to you?
They got me, Lilica.
They finished me off.
They took me to the box.
They let me have it.
Really worked me over.
Where are you hurt?
Tell me, tell me.
Tell me, where did they hit you?
Everywhere.
Help me, Lilica.
I'll help you, I'm here beside you.
I promise no one will lay a hand on you again.
No one will harm you.
- He's dying.
- No he's not!
You're my man. You're my love.
You're my life.
I promise I'll always stay by your side.
- He's dying!
- He's N0T dying!
You're not dying.
You're gonna stay with me.
I love you.
I do.
You'll pay for this you fucking swine!
I'll kill all of you!
I'll be the next one.
Dito, let's split.
0pen this door!
Let's destroy this shit hole.
They want to kill me!
Mr. Mario, I'm really very worried.
How so?
It was a kids rumble?
- What was the dead kid into?
- Deviates.
If there is no suspect, find one.
This will blow the whole thing wide open.
The 2nd death in less than 2 weeks.
You can ask Almir about the first one.
You know why, this country doesn't budge?
Because it's full of idiots.
The judge has just arrived.
Well let's get it over with.
Tonight, a boy was killed.
Tell me everything you know, as if telling your father.
I'm here to help you.
Why all the destruction?
Isn't this your home?
A home we all ought to take care of.
Why all this crazy fighting, even killing each other.
You're here to reintegrate into society as useful citizens.
You're missing the chance of a lifetime.
Why?
Can anyone tell me?
Can you?
I'll only leave here when I know the truth.
Only God can give or take life away.
They're all blind, deaf, and dumb.
They're covering up because they all feel guilty.
You're almost 18, aren't you?
You were a friend of the victim?
I knew him.
- Tell me about him.
- I have nothing to say.
I know nothing.
- Want to talk in private?
- What?
You can talk. The judge will protect you.
Why'd you do it?
Did he betray you?
Where you jealous?
Go on, tell us!
It's a lie! You're trying to frame me!
Did you start it?
Queer stuff, right or wrong?
He hit you and that's how it happened, right?
You animals!
You killed him, you disgusting fairy!
Stop!
Leave!
Get out!
Go!
You can tell me, son.
Don't be afraid.
My God!
That's the window!
Freedom's outside.
Let's go.
C'mon, let's go, man!
It's worse out there for me.
Idiot!
Stop, thief!
I love lying here in the sun.
When I am with you,
I feel so calm.
And you?
Imagine us in Copacabana.
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.
Take all of us, Dito.
Take us.
I promise. When I make the big time...
...all four of us will go.
- Awesome!
I want to ask you something.
Anything.
- Do you like me?
- Of course I do.
Then say...
...Lilica, I love you.
- Cut it out, Lilica!
- Say it, Dito.
Don't fuck with me.
Fuck with you, I will.
Lilica.
Awesome. Long time, no see.
What a surprise, get in.
I thought you had forgotten me!
Forgotten you? How could
I forget you.
You took your time!
We've been here since 9.
Go on, Lilica.
Take it in.
The peace pipe.
- It's all yours, Dito.
- No, I don't do grass.
Don't do grass?
You only took a small hit.
I don't care for non-smokers.
If you think you're gonna sit here looking on...
- I just don't feel like it.
- Don't feel like it, my ass.
Show this crumb what it's all about.
Suck in, man.
Cristal, your car is really great.
It is for me and my friends.
But only my close ones.
What do you think this is, man?
Lemon pledge time?
- Leave the kid alone, Cristal.
- What are you thinking, queen?
What are you thinking, eh?
Sorry.
Sorry my ass! You ain't gonna watch anything!
You come here, drink my whiskey...
...mess the place up...
...watch this shitty film...
What do you think I am, a hostess?
You've got it all wrong.
Dito is just a kid.
He doesn't know anything about this sort of thing.
- Give him a break.
- I won't even wish him luck.
I'm wasting my time with these crumbs.
You want to know something?
I won't make no deal.
So you can't get out, now!
You can't do this. Dito worked his ass off to get the dough!
That's not my problem.
It's yours! Out!
Just this favor.
No, I won't.
Let me talk to him for a while.
Assholes!
Some is missing. There's
5,000 or so.
I soon as I sell the stuff, it'll be O.K.
And where are you going to deal it?
In Rio. I know the spots.
I'm gonna save you some time.
I don't do this for anyone, but I like you.
When you get there, see my friend Debora.
A fine chick with a large clientele.
Take the stuff to her. Rio's a pretty bad place.
If you can't find her look for
Raulzinho at the cowboy club.
- You know the place, don't you?
- I know it.
Get going then.
And don't forget.
You owe me 5 more grand.
And no double-crossing.
If you mess things up it'll cost double.
This is your break.
Either you deal...
...or you'll get dealt!
Boy, am I hungry!
Just pretend you are eating and you'll be O.K.
Do you think we are on the wrong train?
If we are, we'll get the right one.
We'll get there sooner or later.
When I get my share, I'm gonna get a board like that.
I'm not into that.
I'd like a stream where
I can see the bottom.
I spoke to the lady.
She's nearby.
Me and Lilica will go.
You two stay here.
Hey man, we're together.
Why can't we go too?
Yeah, Dito. I want to see the lady, if she's sexy.
- O.K. Let's go.
- C'mon Pixote.
It's good. I'll take it.
- How did you get here?
- By train?
What are you staring at?
Think I'm pretty?
I think.
Cristal is still kicking?
I thought he'd vanished.
- Is this your first trip here?
- Yeah, the first.
Okay, that'll be 13,000.
Did she say she lived here?
Where does she sleep?
No telephone; no nothing.
It's empty.
- Why? You don't trust me?
- No, it's not that.
Let's be friends.
I'll take you home. I've got a son about your age.
Wouldn't you like to play with him?
This is for food, and the rest will come later.
What? Don't you trust me?
You've got my number.
It's very simple.
I'll take the stuff, take it to my friend...
...he pays me, and
I'll pay you.
Or do you think I'd walk around with all that money?
We won't leave without the dough!
- I'm the boss, Lilica!
- You're gonna get dealt.
- Debora seems all right.
- Keep out of this, Pixote!
Okay, you know best.
This is the way I work, if you don't want it, fine.
How long would we have to wait?
Jesus, I'll be back as soon as I can.
But leave half the stuff for good faith.
The water is great, Lilica.
Don't splash, Chico.
Didn't they teach you any manners at home?
What home, Lilica?
The brothel?
Watch your mouth. My home was no brothel!
Will you two quit fighting!
Shouldn't Debora be back by now?
Maybe we'd better go back.
Dito will be pissed.
We just got here.
Why do we have to go now?
I want to know if Dito's got the dough.
I saw some great threads today, all embroidered.
When I get my share, no one will mess with me.
- I won't die like Big Boy.
- Nobody knows the future.
When I get my share of the take, Lilica...
...I'm gonna buy a nice black.38 and you know what I'll do?
This is a hold up! Get 'em up, you bastard.
That's how I'll treat those ass kickers.
Everyone will respect me.
Chico, the Trigger King.
And know who'll be the first?
The big-shot cop who beat me up at the station...
...and I didn't even know why he was hitting me.
But his day will come.
That son of a bitch will pay.
Roberto should be here with us.
It'd be great if he were here.
But he couldn't go in the water; his leg would rust.
- I'll be 18 next month.
- Getting old, eh? Lilica?
Then the going will get rough.
I'll have to cool it.
If I'm caught, I'll be beaten and locked up forever.
When I'm 18, I'll split.
I'll see if Roberto will let me join his band.
For me, things will be the same.
They'll always be on my back.
They'll always find a way of messing me up.
What can a queen expect from life?
Nothing, Lilica.
I knew that whore was double-crossing us.
Fuck!
Son of a bitch!
How did we ever get into this?
You got us into this.
Did I give her the stuff?
Wake up, will you?
Aren't you the lay of that bastard, Cristal?
How does Cristal come into this?
Well, all you wanted was to make it with him.
You took us along to show off.
Baby's jealous, isn't he?
I didn't do it to show off.
I did it for you.
One thing I hate is people cheating me.
Business is business.
- Yes, or no?
- That depends.
Some business requires a little cheating.
Kiss off, Lilica! I never wanna see your face again!
What's wrong with you?
What's done is done.
Just go!
Really want me to go, Dito.
Just repeat that and you won't see me again.
Go on, say it!
Repeat it!
Come here.
It's okay. Raulzinho's waiting.
Not me, I wouldn't feel safe.
If they're caught they can say they're begging, or something.
I'll do it.
Don't hand over the stuff without getting the cash.
No "laters."
No, I must go to Sao Paulo, on business.
I'll be back in two days.
Who are you?
What do you want?
We called you up.
Cristal sent us.
Yes, I know.
No, no, I'm here.
Come in.
No, I'll be back soon.
Let me see the stuff.
Put the shit over here!
No, it's a private matter.
I'll tell you later.
Hang on.
- How much?
- 8,000 in cash.
What the fu...?
Okay, okay, hang on.
Why the hell did you give it to him?
Didn't you hear what
Lilica said?
What could I do?
He asked for it.
Just because he asked, you gave it?
Hi there!
See who's there?
That cow Debora.
Let's go call Dito.
No way, well take care of her ourselves.
- What about the stuff?
- We'll get it later.
C'mon.
Everything O.K.
- Hi, boys.
We came to get our money.
We waited all day.
I was held up in traffic.
Glad you came. I've got the cash.
You wait outside and after the show I'll pay you.
No way!
We're not gonna fall for that twice.
We want it now, okay.
Piss off! Leave, or I'll call the police!
Then your bag goes with us!
Speak to me!
Speak to me, for God's sake!
This is Dito, this is Pixote, all real nice people.
Hey, take a look at that dark one over there.
- What do you think?
- I like it.
She's a love machine, man.
1,000 a day, at least.
I'll hand her over to you, because I'm going away.
It's a bargain.
Let's get to the point.
Turn it off!
We gotta talk.
Close your eyes.
You think I'm stupid?
I was good to you, wasn't I?
Sure, but you know
I've got to cut out.
Only for a while.
They're O.K., What's more, you said you'd agree with it.
What am I gonna do with these kids?
It's only for a while.
I'll come straight back.
Don't want to make trouble, do you, Sueli?
Okay, forget it.
Just let me rest.
Hand over the 1,000, then...
Easy, brother!
This gun is great. It's brand new.
You only need some bullets.
Another 1,000 and it's yours, you'll need it.
I've got one.
- Like it? Do you want it?
- Of course, I do.
I'll take it for Pixote.
What are you peeking at?
You hurt?
You sick?
I may be.
Why are you staring?
- Should I have kept the baby?
- What baby?
That one!
What do you think that is?
A steak?
Didn't your mom tell you the facts of life? Even looks like you.
Look at him!
Stop staring at me!
Get out, or I'll stick you like I stuck him! Go!
This goddamned fever...
...won't it ever go away?
There's blood in the bathroom,
I think she's hurt.
No, she's not hurt.
She's menstruating.
Didn't they ever tell you?
Every woman has it.
Quiet, Lilica. I don't want fighting here.
Why are you people so quiet?
It's like a funeral.
I'm sorry, but I'm not myself today.
Anyone want some?
I'll just give it to Lilica.
You're of age now, right?
Now I can see you better.
If you know how, everything will be swell.
We'll divide the money in half.
- In half!
- Shut up, will you?!
You've got a deal!
- This could put you in jail.
- Don't worry, we're minors.
There won't be any trouble.
Of course.
So sure of yourself.
Eh, darling?
Who are you trying to fool?
The macho number doesn't add up with me.
My last left a souvenir in the bathroom.
You saw it, didn't you?
- What did you say your name was?
- Pixote.
Pretty name.
Don't be angry with me.
I'm on the edge today.
They told me you are nice people.
Pixote could be the man for me. How about it?
Here we are.
- Isn't it nice?
- What a flea bag!
I didn't expect a place like this!
It's cheap.
Anyway, for making love, it's the company that counts.
What are you waiting for, pops?
I thought you couldn't wait?
Lean back. Let me help you with your pants.
Shall I put some talc on it?
Gimme your whole repertoire.
- You're terrific.
- So are you.
Never seen anything nicer than you.
I'm crazy about you.
Okay, you motherfucker...
- Hand over the money!
- Take the money...
...but don't kill me,
I have a family!
See if this makes you cum!
Take everything, but don't kill me.
What did you think of our performance?
It was really great.
Give me your meat, if you don't want it.
You're like pigs!
Take it!
She's pissed off?
- They're queers, aren't they?
- Lilica likes cock...
...but Dito doesn't. I know him. I can assure you.
Now, I'll have a big chocolate ice cream.
What about you?
Cognac and marshmallow.
Enjoying it?
Well worth the money, eh?
How much is a car like this?
You're rich, eh?
I want one.
I want a car like this.
I want a car like this one.
Easy now, or I'll blow your brains out!
Quiet, or I'll cut your balls off!
Nice and quiet.
Go on, get in there!
I think he shit in his pants.
- Everything okay?
- Better and better.
He beat me so hard, I ended up in the hospital.
I told him, "Shove your money up your ass."
"I'll have a house and a car all my own."
Then I went to Sao Paulo, on my own.
I worked in a nightclub.
It was great. I felt like a queen.
I would dance all night.
Change the music.
Hey, I was enjoying that!
Sueli told me too.
She's great, eh?
That's all I needed.
Like it?
What did you do there?
I was a go-go girl. I had a bikini like this...
...all covered with glitter.
Smashing! Sort of heart shaped.
I love dancing.
I used to dance all night on a stool like this.
- Why did they throw you out?
- That's a long story.
This car is much nicer than
Cristal's.
Think the guy in back is hungry?
Just leave me alone!
What's up with you today?
You're being so difficult.
Nothing's the matter.
I hate drunks!
Look, she's drunk.
No big deal.
So what!
- And stop talking trash!
- I just don't like it.
So, give me some money, and I'll go.
Drop dead, you silly fag!
Don't treat me this way.
I'm gonna split.
No one's leaving.
Don't you like it here?
What's wrong?
Something upset you?
Don't break up the party.
Ever give anyone a French kiss?
God, she's gross!
Anyone like to dance?
Did he have to do that to me?
Bar me from the door of the club...
...with everyone looking.
Whenever I recall that,
I can't control myself.
Wake up.
Where's Lilica?
She split.
Just as well, she was pissing me off.
Don't talk about her that way.
- She was nice.
- Go after her, then.
- You'd make a lovely couple.
- She was cool.
You're the son of a bitch!
Look, if you don't like it, just get out!
The fewer we are, the better.
You can't say that
This isn't your house!
You're asking for it!
We saw your mother giving her ass to Sapato.
You screwy bastard!
- That goddamned whore!
- Think I didn't know?!
I told you she'd be first on my list.
So keep your nose out of other people's business!
Did you hear, you asshole?!
What time is it?
Up we go!
Let's go make babies.
Sit there gringo, We'll soon finish you off.
Let me kiss you.
Fuckin' gringo, don't push me!
Don't push me.
Let me kiss you there, you scumbag!
Keep still, creep, or you're dead!
Get him, Dito!
Get him!
I told you never to say my name!
Stop that! Look out, Dito!
Shoot!
I'm leaving, Sueli.
Dito was a nice guy.
I know, don't talk about him anymore.
Dito's dead.
I was falling for Dito.
Lilica was right to fall for him.
All of my family is from Minas.
We could go there.
Come with me?
Don't go away.
I can't live all alone.
What's wrong?
It's over.
Come with me, will you?
What's wrong?
Don't be like that.
Calm down. Everything's okay.
Sueli's here.
It's over now.
Better now?
Baby, suck it.
Mommy's with you.
Get off me, Pixote!
Get off, Pixote!
I don't want this!
Take your dirty mouth off me!
I'm not your mother!
Do you hear?!
I don't want a child!
I hate children!
Go live your own life!
We'll each get by on our own!
Scram!
Go.
You see? You see the symbolism of it?
Capital and Labor destroy each other.
It teaches a moral lesson.
It has social significance.
Who wants to see that kind of stuff?
It gives me the creeps.
Tell him how long it played in the Music Hall.
It was held over a fifth week.
Who goes to the Music Hall?
Communists!
Communists? This picture's an answer to Communists!
It shows we're awake... and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches!
I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions.
Stark realism. The problems that confront the average man.
- But with a little sex.
- A little, but I don't want to stress it.
I want this picture to be a document.
I want to hold a mirror up to life.
I want this to be a picture of dignity... a true canvas of the suffering of humanity.
But with a little sex.
- With a little sex in it.
- How about a nice musical?
How can you talk about musicals at a time like this, with the world committing suicide?
With corpses piling up in the street, with grim death gargling at you from every corner,
- with people slaughtered like sheep!
- Maybe they'd like to forget.
Then why did they hold this one over for a fifth week? For the ushers?
- It died in Pittsburgh.
- Like a dog.
- What do they know in Pittsburgh?
- They know what they like.
If they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.
If you pandered to the public, you'd still be in the horse age.
You think we're not?
Look at Hop-along Cassidy.
You look at him!
We'd still be making Keystone chases, bathing beauties, custard pie...
- And a fortune.
- A fortune.
Of course I'm just a minor employee here, Mr. LeBrand...
He's starting that one again.
I wanted to make you something outstanding... something you could be proud of, something that would realize the potentialities of film... as the sociological and artistic medium that it is.
With a little sex in it.
Something like...
- Something like Capra. I know.
- What's the matter with Capra?
Look, you want to make O
Brother, Where Art Thou?
Yes.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Then go ahead and make it!
For what you're getting,
I can't afford to argue with you.
That's a fine way to start a man out on a million-dollar production.
You want it, you've got it!
I can take it on the chin.
I've taken it before.
- Not from me you haven't.
- Not from you, Sully, that's true.
Not with pictures like
So Long Sarong,
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft,
Ants in Your Plants of 1939...
But they weren't about tramps, lockouts, sweatshops, people eating garbage in alleys and living in piano boxes and ash cans.
- And phooey!
- They're about nice, clean young people... who fell in love... with laughter and music and legs.
Now take that scene in
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft...
But you don't realize conditions have changed.
There isn't any work.
There isn't any food.
- These are troublous times.
- What do you know about trouble?
- What do I know about trouble?
- Yes, what do you know about trouble?
What do you mean, what do I know about trouble?
Just what
I'm saying.
You want to make a picture about garbage cans...
When did you eat your last meal out of one?
- What's that got to do with it?
- He's asking you.
You want an epic about misery... you want to show hungry people sleeping in doorways.
With newspapers around them.
You want to grind
10,000 feet of hard luck,
- and all I'm asking you is, what do you know about hard luck? - Yes!
- What do you mean? Don't you think I've...
- No.
- What?
- You have not.
I sold newspapers till I was 20, then I worked in a shoe store and put myself through law school at night.
- Where were you at 20?
- I was in college.
When I was 13 I supported three sisters, two brothers and a widowed mother.
- Where were you at 13?
- I was in boarding school.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully.
That's the reason your pictures have been so light, so cheerful, so inspiring.
They don't stink with messages.
That's why I paid you
500 a week when you were 24.
- 750 at 25.
- 1,000 when you were 26.
- When I was 26, I was getting 18.
- 2,000 at 27.
- I was getting 25 then.
- 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday.
4,000 after Ants in Your Plants.
I suppose you're trying to tell me
I don't know what trouble is.
- Yes!
- In a nice way, Sully.
You're absolutely right.
I haven't any idea what it is.
People always like what they don't know anything about.
I had a lot of nerve wanting to make a picture about human suffering.
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully, but then, you are anyway.
How about making
Ants in Your Plants of 1941?
- You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin...
- Maybe Bing Crosby.
- The Abbott Dancers.
- Maybe Jack Benny and Rochester.
- A big-name band.
- What?
Oh, no. I want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do first.
I'm going down to wardrobe to get some old clothes,
- some old shoes,
- Huh? and I'm gonna start out with ten cents in my pocket.
What?
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm not coming back...
- till I know what trouble is.
- What?
Don't worry, you can take me off salary.
Who's talking about taking you off salary?
- So long. Thanks for the idea.
- Wait! Don't be so impulsive.
- How soon will you be back?
- I don't know.
Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a year.
Don't worry about me. And thanks,
Dracula. You gave me a great idea.
I gave you...
- Now look what you've done.
- Yeah... What I've done?
With your lies about selling newspapers!
I sold as many newspapers as you supported a family at 13.
- I opened a shooting gallery.
- With money you borrowed from your uncle.
- We better insure him for a million.
- He's worth more.
- The bonehead.
- Yes, but what a genius.
Get me a copy of that
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
I guess I'll have to read it now.
Make that two copies.
Why should I suffer alone?
- How's this?
- Isn't that overdoing it, a bit sir?
Why break their hearts?
All right.
Let's try that one again.
I think this one's sufficiently seedy, sir.
There's no use overplaying it, is there, sir?
Yes?
- Your wife is on one, sir.
- What does she want?
I suspect it has something to do with today's being the 15th.
Payday. All right, put her on.
You may connect Mrs. Sullivan.
Yes?
You don't happen to remember what day this is, do you, dear?
Yes, I happen to remember what day it is.
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Have you?
Perhaps I could be a little more polite, Mrs. Sullivan, but somehow, when I talk to you
I don't feel polite.
I regret it, but that's the way it is.
I don't know whether
I signed it or not.
I always close my eyes when I sign your check.
Maybe I signed the blotter.
Have you made out the Panther Woman's check yet?
You better get it down to her before she comes up here with the sheriff.
She has a very peculiar sense of humor.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Burrows.
How do you like it?
I don't like it at all, sir.
Fancy dress, I take it?
- What's the matter with it?
- I have never been sympathetic... to the caricaturing of the poor and needy, sir.
Who's caricaturing?
Burrows doesn't know about the expedition, sir.
I'm going out on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and needy, and then I'm going to make a picture about it.
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one.
The poor know all about poverty... and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous.
But I'm doing it for the poor.
Don't you understand?
I doubt if they would appreciate it, sir.
They rather resent the invasion of their privacy, I believe quite properly, sir.
Also, such excursions can be extremely dangerous, sir.
I worked for a gentleman once who likewise, with two friends, accoutered themselves as you have, sir, and then went out for a lark.
They have not been heard from since.
- That was some time ago?
- 1912, sir.
- Huh.
- You see, sir, rich people... and theorists... who are usually rich people... think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches... as disease might be called the lack of health.
But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera, with filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms.
It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes of study.
It is to be shunned.
You seem to have made quite a study of it.
Quite unwillingly, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
- Thanks.
- Very good, sir.
He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while.
Yeah.
Always reading books, sir.
- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, sir,
I don't like the idea of a gentleman of your inexperience... leaving with only ten cents in his pockets, so I took the extreme liberty, sir, of having a studio identification card... sewed into the sole of each of your boots.
You'd think I was a child.
The whole purpose of this expedition...
All right, all right, all right.
Before you all get started,
I just want to tell you one thing...
- My mind is made up.
- Nobody's here to argue, Sully.
- I know.
- You know that your slightest wish...
We talked it all over, and there's something to the idea.
- There's a great deal to it.
- Stupendous.
Cassy has it all worked out. It's safe as a church, big as a cathedral.
Bigger!
It's the story of the year.
It'll make the front page of every newspaper in the country.
- I'm sending five of my boys...
- With me in charge.
An advance agent in front and a follow-up behind.
- A cook and a still man.
- I want lots of 8x10's.
- Now, listen...
- I'm revamping that lovely land yacht...
that Demille used in Northwest Mounted.
- It follows at a discreet dis...
- Hot coffee, sandwiches, and a bar in back.
It's connected to the studio by shortwave, and it also carries...
- A hot shower and a secretary.
- And a physician.
Look, I'm trying to find trouble, but I won't find it with six acts of vaudeville on my tail... at least, not the kind
I'm looking for.
- Be reasonable, Sully.
- I'm reupholstering it from stem to stern.
- Wait till you see.
- I tell you, I've made up my mind.
- Definitely?
- Definitely.
In that case, there's nothing else to do...
You said it. but to serve you with this summons to appear and show cause... why you should not be restrained from jeopardizing your unique and extraordinary services... by willfully, recklessly and unnecessarily...
Will you please wait a minute!
We have all day, Sully, but you must realize... we also have minds, also made up.
Thus begins this remarkable expedition... into the valley of the shadow of adversity.
The shadow of the what?
The valley of the shadow of adversity.
- It's what you call a paraphrase.
- Alone and unattended...
With eight stooges.
I'll write the story, if it's just the same to you.
Prey to passing prowlers, poverty and policemen,
- How poetic.
- with only ten cents in his pocket,
- I wish I had what he's got in the bank.
- John Lloyd Sullivan, the Caliph of Comedy...
- Departed Hollywood at 4:00 this morning.
- You said it.
- Can I sell you another stack, Doctor?
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda, and don't call me "Doctor. "
He was talking to me, I think.
No, thank you.
You say don't want some bicarbonate of soda, Doctor?
Don't call me "Doctor"!
- No, I don't want any bicarbonate of soda.
- I thought you said you did.
Well, he don't!
- This place is very depressing.
- So was the breakfast.
Why doesn't he read a book if he wants to learn something?
- Who, the cook? He could learn plenty.
- No, Sullivan.
- Maybe he don't know how to read.
- The cook?
No, the...
- This is gonna be a great trip.
- Sorry. I must have the wrong number.
That was the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
Ask him what his daughter's doing.
I said the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
- How about a little gin rummy?
- I don't drink, thank you. Never touch it.
- How about a lift, Bud?
- If you don't mind going fast.
I'm studying to be a whippet tanker.
- Go to it, Lieutenant!
- You're there, General.
- Can a whippet tank make a sharp turn?
- What?
Can a whippet tank go up a side road?
A whippet tank can go anywhere.
Hang on!
Thank you, Major.
- This is where I get out.
- She's some tank, ain't she?
In a class by herself.
I never felt anything like it.
Well, I guess I better be getting to school now, anyway.
Yeah, I guess you better had.
Drive carefully.
- You know me.
- By the way, how old are you?
- Thirteen. So long.
- So long.
What a future.
What were you chasing, a jackrabbit?
- Felt more like a kangaroo.
- There he is!
- Well, how'd you like it?
- That was a dirty trick, boss.
Look, that was just a rough idea, unless you play ball with me.
You know I can't do what I started out to do with you guys chasing me around, so I'll make you a fair proposition.
You can go on wherever you like and take it easy for a couple of weeks, and I'll join you then or sooner.
If the boss wants to talk to me,
I'm just up ahead, mooching a lunch from a farmer's wife.
Now, is that a square proposition or isn't it?
Well, I always wanted to go to Boulder Dam.
You're there.
Yeah, well, if you think
I'm going to look at Boulder Dam...
How about
National Yellow Park?
That goes double for National Yellow Park.
- If you'd said Las Vegas...
- What do they do in Las Vegas?
Everything, Doctor.
It's an education.
All right. I'll meet you in Las Vegas, on or about the first.
And thanks, kids.
Thanks sincerely.
Yoo-hoo!
- Yes, ma'am?
- Don't get too tired.
Yes, ma'am.
First day's work. You don't suppose you're overworking him, do you?
Oh, but I doubt it. He seems very strong. Did you notice his torso?
- I notice that you noticed it.
- Don't be vindictive, dear.
Some people are just naturally more sensitive to some things in life than some people.
Some are blind to beauty, while others...
Even as a little girl, you were more of acid type, dear, while I, if you remember...
- I remember better than you do.
- Well, forget it.
And furthermore, I have never done anything that I was ashamed of, Ursula.
- Neither have I.
- Yes, but nobody ever asked you to.
Why, Zeffie
Kornhauser!
Now that you've had your attack for the day, let's endeavor to recapture our good humor and remember our breeding.
- Baloney.
- Yes. I do hope he likes it here.
It's so hard to keep a man.
Do you know what I need?
- Yes!
- I need a permanent.
I was thinking of taking in a picture show, which brings up the problem of clothes for the young man.
- It certainly does.
- Do you think...
dear Joseph would mind if we gave him...
some of the clothes he has so little need for now?
He's never minded before.
- Sleep tight.
- Yes, ma'am.
- And don't let the skeeters bite.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're sure you have everything you want?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely sure?
- Positive.
- But your bed isn't open.
- That's all right. I'll take care of that.
Oh, nonsense.
That's woman's work.
? For men must work and women must weep?
Or however it goes.
Ahh!
- There. Would you like a hot water bottle?
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't any pajamas.
- I never use them.
- Joseph wore a nightgown.
- Is that a fact?
Oh, yes.
- Well, I guess there's nothing else.
- No, I guess not.
I'll let you know as soon as the bathroom is free.
- It's community.
- Ah.
Well, uh...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Do you think he'll stay?
- I do, do hope so.
Who is it?
Say, could you give me a lift?
I'm freezing to death.
- What did you fall into?
- Everything there was.
Okay. Hop in the back.
Here. Drape this around you.
Thanks a million, buddy.
- Okay.
Come on, Buddy, wake up.
This is as far as I go.
- Huh? What? Who are you?
- Come on, wake up.
I don't want the boss to see you.
We ain't supposed to give lifts.
Sure. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, what city is this?
- That's Hollywood.
Hollywood?
You get a chance to see the moving picture stars.
Well, so long.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Give me a cup of coffee and a donut, if that's enough for it.
- You want it plain or with powdered sugar?
- With a little cream.
- The sinker?
- Any kind, or some rolls. I don't care.
Yes, sir.
Give him some ham and eggs.
Yes, ma'am.
That's very kind of you sister, but I'm not hungry.
A cup of coffee and a sinker will fix me up fine.
Don't be a sucker.
Give him some ham and eggs.
The way I'm fixed, 35 cents isn't going to make any difference.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Things a little tough, huh?
I wouldn't be sitting in an owl wagon for local color.
They locked me out of my room.
That's too bad.
Well, things are tough everywhere.
War in Europe, strikes over here...
There's no work.
- There's no food.
- Drink your coffee while it's hot.
What did they lock you out of your room for?
Did I ask you any questions?
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- You been in Hollywood long?
- Long enough.
- Trying to crash the movies or something?
- Something like that.
- I guess that's pretty hard to do, huh?
- I guess so.
I never got close enough to find out.
- Oh. Sorry.
- Say, who's being sorry for who?
Am I buying you the eggs or are you buying me the eggs?
I'd just like to repay you.
All right, give me a letter of introduction to Lubitsch.
I might be able to do that.
Who's Lubitsch?
Drink your coffee.
- Can you act?
- What did you say?
- I said, can you act?
- Sure, I can act.
Would you like me to give you a recitation?
Go ahead.
Skip it. My next act will be an impersonation... of a young lady going home... on the thumb.
- In that outfit?
- What about your own outfit?
- I mean, haven't you got a car?
- No. Have you?
- No, but...
- Then don't get ritzy.
And I'll tell you some other things I haven't got.
I haven't got a yacht, or a pearl necklace, or a fur coat, or a country seat, or even a winter seat.
I could use a new girdle, too.
I wish I could give you some of the things you need.
You wouldn't be trying to lead me astray, would you?
You know, the nice thing about buying food for a man... is that you don't have to laugh at his jokes.
Just think... if you were some big shot, like a casting director,
I'd be staring into your bridgework saying,
"Yes, Mr. Smearkase.
No, Mr. Smearkase.
"Not really, Mr. Smearkase.
Oh, Mr. Smearkase, that's my knee. "
Give Mr. Smearkase another cup of coffee. Make it two.
- Want a piece of pie?
- No thanks, kid.
Why, Mr. smearkase, aren't you getting a little familiar?
Look...
Thanks.
Look, if you wanted to stay in Hollywood a little longer...
I don't want to stay in Hollywood a little longer.
I've used up all my money, all my going-home money.
I was just gonna say,
I have a friend that's out of town... and you might be able to stay at his place for a couple of weeks... and maybe by then things will break a little better for you.
He might even be able to help you a little.
No, thanks.
There's no strings to this, kid.
I know you don't know who I am, but
I used to know a few people around here.
And this guy's really out of town.
And you know a way in through the window. No, thanks.
- No. I'm pretty sure that in this case...
- I'm going home, big boy.
I can get a ride out of here in a little while.
I don't like to think of you asking a bunch of thugs for lifts along the highway.
Then don't think about it.
You mean you'd just get in any car that comes along?
Anything but a Stanley Steamer.
My uncle blew up in one.
That's terrible.
You can't tell what kind of a heel is apt to be behind the wheel.
All heels are pretty much the same.
- Look.
- Yes, Mr. Smearkase?
This friend of mine... the guy I was telling you about that's out of town...
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I borrowed his car.
- What is it, a street car?
- It's a car. Just wait here.
You're just going to get yourself in trouble.
I'm not going to get myself in trouble.
I'm going to repay you.
That isn't necessary, big boy.
Someday, when your ship comes in, you can buy somebody that's hungry some ham and eggs and be all square.
That's fine. Just wait here and I'll be back before you can say...
- What was that big director's name?
- Lubitsch.
Lubitsch.
Say, this is some car.
Yes. Now, where would you like to go?
Could you drop me off at, uh...
Or maybe that'd be too far.
- That depends entirely on where it is.
- Would Chicago be too far?
- Chicago? You mean Chicago, Illinois?
- Yes.
I wasn't actually thinking of driving as far as Chicago.
That's all right.
You can drop me anywhere.
I just happened to think of Chicago because... that's a little better than halfway and
I can easily hitch a ride out of there.
- Where do you live, Bermuda?
- You don't have to get funny.
I didn't ask you for a ride.
You can drop me anywhere.
Wait a minute. How's this?
Suppose you drop me off somewhere and you go leisurely home... and I'll pick up the car later.
That's what you call an idea.
You don't happen to operate out of a booby hatch, do you?
You better drop me at the next corner and take this bus back where you stole it from.
Don't talk nonsense. I left a note saying I was taking the car...
- Or did I?
- It would be nice if you could remember.
Would be funny, though, if they arrested me for taking it.
A panic.
Who does it belong to?
Belongs to a picture director... a guy named Sullivan.
Oh.
- You never heard of him?
- No.
He's made quite a few pictures.
Ants In Your Plants of 1939.
- Did he do that?
- Yeah. Did you see it?
- Yes.
- Well? Well, did you like it?
- Not much.
- Some people thought it was pretty good.
I don't care for musicals.
They hurt my ears.
I see. Well, did you like
Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft?
- Oh, I was crazy about that.
- I thought that would just about fit.
You remember the scene where the two are in the hayloft?
Perfectly.
And she made him close his eyes and count three before kissing her.
Yes, yes.
And then the pig came out and he kissed the pig instead.
It was on a very high plane.
Then he fell through a hole and sneezed at a horse.
And the horse sneezed back at him.
Oh, that was a wonderful scene.
Of course it was stupid, but it was wonderful. Who directed that picture?
Don't you think with the world in its present condition, with death snarling at you from every street corner, that people are a little allergic to comedies?
- No.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
Say, how come you know a picture director well enough to borrow his car?
As a matter of fact,
I used to know most of those boys, but naturally I don't like to mention it in a suit like this.
As a matter of fact,
I used to be a picture director.
- Why, you poor kid.
- Don't get emotional. I'll be all right.
What kind of pictures did you make?
- More along educational lines.
- Oh, no wonder.
There's nothing like a deep-dish movie to drive you out in the open.
What are you talking about?
Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known.
You take a picture like Hold Back Tomorrow.
You hold it.
- Did you ever meet Lubitsch?
- Yes.
Gee, I bet he wouldn't even speak to you now.
- He spoke to me day before yesterday.
- Isn't that swell.
Funny, isn't it... to meet your first picture director... on the day you're leaving
Hollywood, all washed up... even a washed-up director.
Don't get sympathetic.
I might make a comeback, you know.
That's what they all say.
Man that had my room ahead of me... he was always going to make a comeback.
He was a picture director too.
Then one day he shot himself instead.
They had to re-paper the room.
You wouldn't ever do anything like that would you, big boy?
Not on your wallpaper.
What do you suppose that is?
Whatever it is, there's absolutely nothing they can do.
Remember that.
What did you say?
I said there's absolutely nothing they can do.
All right, you.
All right yourself.
Don't give it a thought.
Well?
Oh, good morning, sir.
- I'm so sorry.
- Good morning, sir.
- Ever seen this man before?
- That is Mr. Sullivan, sir,
- the owner of the alleged hot car.
- Then what's all the hullabaloo?
That's what I'd like to know.
- You John L. Sullivan?
- What about it?
- What's your occupation?
- Motion picture director.
- That right?
- Yes, sir.
Let me see your driver's license.
- I haven't got it. Did you bring it?
- No, sir.
- Driving without a license, huh?
- Yes, isn't that terrible?
I suppose that calls for a dollar fine and ten minutes in jail.
- You sure this is Sullivan?
- Oh, quite, sir.
- What are you doing in those clothes?
- I just paid my income tax.
- All right, but you don't drive that car without a license. - Okay.
Let the girl out too.
She's getting bored in there.
How does a girl fit in this picture?
There's always a girl in the picture.
Haven't you ever been to the movies?
Where's he taking us now?
Whose car is this?
- The same guy. Sullivan.
- Where's he taking us?
Down to the depot to buy you a ticket and send you home. Stop fooling around.
- Who's buying me a ticket?
- Sullivan.
- What did I ever do for him?
- You bought him some eggs.
Oh. So you're the washed-up director.
I'm afraid I exaggerated that part of it a little bit.
What are you doing in those clothes?
I just pulled that one down at the police station.
Huh?
I made up a joke.
Look, I'm not sore at you.
I'm sore at those cops for dragging me all the way back here.
No matter where I start out for, I always end up right back here in Hollywood.
You're a very nice girl, as a matter of fact, and I'm glad to have met you.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly.
- You mean that?
- Sincerely.
Then buy me some ham and eggs before I bite you.
Home.
Where's the swimming pool?
You must have a swimming pool.
Right out here.
Outside dining room,
- barbecue...
- Hmm.
Pretty, isn't it?
Yeah.
There's the tennis court up there, grape arbor there, and a grove there.
I guess that's about all.
- What are you looking at me that way for?
- Hey, you big fathead!
- What's the big idea?
That's for your swimming pools and your tennis courts...
and your limousines and your barbecues.
That's for making fun of a poor girl who only tried to help you,
- you big faker!
- Who made fun of you?
You did, with your stories of being a washed-up director, you big clunk.
Oh, I did, did I?
Breakfast is served, sir.
- You might have shaved.
- I need these whiskers for my experiment.
- Yes, the noble experiment.
- You don't have to make any cracks.
I don't suffer and starve because I like it, you know.
Neither does anybody else.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry I pushed you in the water too.
- I probably needed it.
- You certainly did.
- Did I?
I didn't mind you. As a matter of fact,
I had kind of a yen for you.
- You have?
- Not in that thing.
I liked you better as a tramp.
I can't help what kind of people you like.
It's funny. I suppose
I ought to be very happy for you, as if you'd just struck oil or something.
Instead of that, I'm sore.
Don't frown.
You're making lines on your face.
You've taken all the joy out of life.
I was all through with this kind of stuff.
I knew I'd never have it, but there was no envy in my heart.
I'd found a friend who swiped a car to take me home.
Now I'm right back where I started... just an extra girl having breakfast with a director, only I didn't used to have breakfast with them.
- Maybe that was my trouble.
- Did they ever ask you to?
- No.
- Then don't pat yourself on the back.
- Take me with you.
- What?
On your experiment.
I don't want to be sent home.
Don't be childish.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can stay here for a couple of weeks like I told you in the owl wagon, and when I get back,
I'll see what I can do for you.
I don't want to start all that stuff again.
Take me with you.
When you get as far as you're going, we can say good-bye... and I'll go the rest of the way alone.
It'll make a nice ending, and we'll finish what we started this morning.
It's absolutely out of the question.
Please. You don't know anything about anything.
You don't know how to get a meal, how to keep a secret,
- and you can't even stay out of town.
- Thanks.
I know 50 times as much about trouble as you ever will.
Besides, you owe it to me.
You sort of belong to me.
When you were a hobo, I found you.
- Piffle.
- Please.
- It's absolutely out of the question.
- I'll throw you in the water.
You'd take my mind off my work.
The big director that has all the girls panting for him.
- I tell you...
- I'll follow you.
I'll tell everybody who you are, like a kid sister.
You'll follow me?
Yes, I'll follow you, and I'll holler, " This guy's a phony.
"This is Sullivan, the big director from Hollywood... a phonus-balonus, a faker, a heel... "
If I may join in the controversy, sir,
I think the young lady's suggestion an excellent one.
- You may not join in the controversy.
- I will, I will, I will!
- I'm going with you!
- You'll do nothing of the kind.
Would you get me some tramp clothes, Mr. Burrows?
Certainly, Miss.
Certainly.
Go down to the station and get me a ticket to...
- Where do you live?
- I won't tell you. I won't be sent home.
You stop that! Now, stop that!
Grab her feet!
Oh! Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.
Now, miss... Now, miss...
Stop it, please, miss!
I won't be sent home!
- Let go of me!
- Oh, my!
Mr. Burrows...
This way, Mr. Burrows.
There we are.
Now, one, two, three... Pull hard!
Hello, Information?
Have you any freight trains... going east this afternoon or early this evening?
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, and could you tell me, does that train carry tramps, and if so, where do they get on?
What? It's on page two.
- What did you say?
- Tramps.
How would you like to take a flying... Wise guy.
Yes, sir?
What was that again?
I said I wonder if you'd be kind enough to settle a bet for us.
Just a few of us here at the club.
If a tramp were to board your 5:48 this afternoon, from where would he board it?
I see. I see. Yes... but not within the yard limits.
I think that gives me the complete picture.
Thank you very much for your trouble.
Oh, and by the way, I win.
Good day.
A different approach to the same problem.
I think this is it, sir.
Why don't you go back with the car.
You look about as much like a boy as Mae West.
All right, they'll think I'm your frail.
I believe it's called a "beazel," miss, if memory serves.
- Good-bye, Burrows. See you in a couple of weeks. - Good-bye.
May I close, sir, by warning you against the entire expedition, which I envision with deep apprehension...
- and gloomy foreboding.
- Thanks. Same to you.
Come on.
Jump!
Come on. Here.
I'll help you.
- Let me up!
- I've got you!
- We made it!
- Yeah.
Amateurs.
Phew!
Oh. How do you do?
- Beautiful weather.
- If it doesn't rain.
How do you feel about the labor situation?
Where are you going?
I hope we didn't disturb you.
- Very interesting couple.
- Yeah.
- Do you smell anything?
- I certainly do.
- What does it smell like to you?
- Hogs.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- I'm getting hungry.
How can you possibly be hungry when you just ate?
I'm not a scientist.
All I know is I'm hungry.
You'd better tell the porter to close the window.
I didn't ask you to come along in the first place. Now that you're...
Don't start baking wise cracks.
- Dough, sir.
- Blasted draft in here, at that.
- Where is this train going?
- I don't know.
- How long does it take to get there?
- I didn't ask you to come along.
I think that's a perfectly reasonable question.
Haven't you got enough imagination to pretend we're broke, hungry, homeless, drifting in despair?
Let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps.
- Cold?
- I'll be all right.
- It's the desert.
- I'll be all right.
As soon as this blasted thing comes to a town someplace,
I'll send for a car and have you taken home.
This is a lot of "hokey-palokey. "
This is a terrible way to travel, with a girl.
It's better with a girl than without one. You would have frozen to death.
If I go back, will you go back with me?
- Dodsense.
- Then I won't go back, either.
You're so simple, you're apt to get into trouble.
Why do you think I'm here?
Gee, I like that about you.
You're like those knights of old, who used to ride around looking for trouble.
- Who was it who rode on a pure white horse?
- Lady Godiva.
She must have been a nut. I bet her husband was sore. Are you jealous?
Why don't you shut up and try to get some sleep.
- Will you go to sleep too?
- I'll try.
Why don't you try counting the hogs jumping over a hedge?
Listen, short britches...
- What's that?
- Nothing. Just me.
- What?
- I sneezed.
- You what?
- I...
- I sneezed.
- Oh, you poor darling.
- Have you got hay fever?
- I think it's hog fever.
Oh, you poor lamb.
It'll be alright as soon as the sun gets a little warmer.
Are you hungry?
You got me doing it.
- Have we got any eating money?
- Ten cents.
Can we spend it for breakfast, or are you saving it for something?
Look, I've already told you,
I'll send for a car for you and...
I can't help it if I'm good-natured.
I like to be with you, and it puts me in a good humor.
You take lots of girls and made them sleep in a hog sty all night, and then didn't tell them where their breakfast was coming from... the next morning, they wouldn't take it lying down.
We'll find some breakfast somewhere.
- In some swill pail, I suppose.
- What do the other bubs do?
They steal chickigs... chickens. and they roast them over campfires... with baked potatoes and green corn on the cob...
- with melted butter...
- Shut up!
- Where do they get the butter?
- They steal it.
Well, they don't.
It isn't as easy as all that.
There's a lot of suffering in this world...
- that ordinary people don't know anything about.
- Now what's the matter?
- I'm hungry.
Well...
Hey, there's a town up ahead.
Let's get off and see what happens.
- What town is it?
- I don't know. I suppose it's Hollywood.
Look, there's a lunch stand.
Come on.
Come on. I can't keep running along here all day.
Here I come. Just a minute.
Well, come on.
- Did I hurt you any?
- Well, you didn't do me any good.
Come on.
A cup of coffee and sinker for one.
I never eat till noon.
It gives me indigestion.
- Just make that two coffees.
- That'll be ten cents.
That's all right.
It's right here someplace.
- Holy Boses.
- What's the matter?
I must have spent it at that owl wagon.
- I'll never get rich.
- Oh, gee.
You're a little richer than you were.
Hundreds of miles from everything, cut off from the world, a taste of human kindness.
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
What town is this?
- Las Vegas, Nevada.
- Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the busy...
- Las Vegas! You mean Las Vegas?
- What about it?
Is there a land yacht waiting here?
Land yacht?
You mean that thing?
That's perfectly wonderful,
Mr. Sullivan.
I rejoice in your experience.
- And where does this gentleman live?
- Just up there by the tracks.
- Give him $100. Never mind who from.
- That's swell.
- A great human-interest story.
- It'll probably ruin him.
He'll give turkey dinners to every slug that comes in... and never hit the jackpot again.
All right, all right.
Buy the kid here a few clothes,
and meet me in Kansas City, someplace near the station.
I'm going the hard way.
So long, gang.
Just a minute, please.
Sit down!
- But listen, Doc!
- You listen.
It's three days in bed, minimum.
This is just a cold shot.
You won't even feel it.
Yow!
- I haven't time to spend three days in bed.
- You'll take the time.
You'll get to Kansas City just as soon, and you can imagine... that you went there on your cow snatcher, or whatever you used.
What have you got an imagination for?
- Here's something for you.
- What's that?
It's Christmas. So long.
Come in!
Here's a wrapper for you and some slippers.
- What?
- A wrapper.
Oh, thanks.
There's some makeup in the medicine cabinet.
- Thanks. I can use it.
- You sure can.
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand, he's in the next room taking a little snooze.
He looks great. This whole thing is doing him a power of good.
- Come in.
- Hello. Feel better?
No, I'm sore. There's nothing the matter with me but a little fever.
Even if I did get sick, they could've sent me to some free hospital.
Wherever they send you.
It would have been very interesting.
They give you a nice free burial too, at Potter's Field.
"Free burial. " Why does everybody exaggerate everything so much?
I've got a little cold in my head.
You take a dose of salts, and there you are.
- It's because you're a very valuable man.
- Bushwah.
- You make very lovely pictures.
- Phooey.
- Well, you do.
- It's a funny thing, how everything... keeps shoving me back to Hollywood or Beverly Hills...
Or this monstrosity we're riding in... almost like gravity.
As if some force were saying,
"Get back where you belong.
You don't belong out here in real life, you phony, you. "
You're a little feverish.
Maybe there's a universal law that says, " Stay put.
As you are, so shall you remain. "
Maybe that's why tramps are always in trouble.
They don't vote.
They don't pay taxes.
They violate the law of nature.
You look very pretty in that outfit.
Maybe that's why they don't want trailer colonies.
- Or am I getting a bit profound?
- You're getting a bit hot.
Your hand is very cool.
But nothing is going stop me...
I'm going to find out how it feels to be in trouble, without friends, without credit, without checkbook, without name... alone.
- And I'll go with you.
- How can I be alone if you're with me?
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand.
It's all finished. the greatest expedition of modern times, almost the greatest sacrifice ever made by human man.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
He's all washed up, except tonight he's going through for a quick tour.
He's taking $1,000 in $5.00 bills... and he's going to hand them out to these tramps in gratitude for what they done for him.
Now is that a story? Does that give you a lump in your throat, or does that give you a lump in your throat?
- Hello.
- Hello. Tired?
No, no.
I was just thinking.
Well, here we are at the end of the adventure.
I'll go down tonight and give them a little money, and that winds it up.
Now, what do you want to do?
Do you want to go home or take another crack at Hollywood?
- Well, I...
- with a nice, fat letter to Lubitsch?
I'd sort of like to... go where you go.
I mean, I'd sort of hoped that you'd...
Well, I mean, that you'd want us to go on together a little longer, now that we kind of got used to each other.
- Of course I would, if I wasn't married.
- Who's married?
Didn't you know that? I thought everyone had heard of my misfortune.
- Of course I didn't.
- What do you mean?
As if I'd snatched you away from your loving grandmother.
- Are you in love with her?
- That vulture?
- Then why did you marry her?
- Income tax.
- Income tax?
- It was supposed to save me $24,000 a year.
It's what's called a joint return.
It's California law.
Each one pays half, and the total is less than the aggregate surtax, so the surtax is less than the something or other.
It was an idea of my business manager's.
- I think it's disgusting.
- It wasn't supposed to be romantic.
It was supposed to save me
$12,000 a year, but it didn't.
Turned out she couldn't live on $12,000 a year.
Good.
- Lovely. She had to have $24,000.
- Good.
Don't keep saying "good" all the time, or I'll poke you in the nose.
- Good.
- Now, listen.
So I demanded the divorce she'd promised me.
And she told you to go fry an egg.
She said it would break her mother's heart.
Some fine advice your business manager gave you.
I found out why.
He was getting half.
- And you really can't get a divorce ever?
- Never.
You can't get a divorce without collusion, and she won't collude.
I guess
I ought to go home, then.
You could still have that letter to Lubitsch.
Could I still come and push you in the pool sometimes?
- Of course you could.
- I guess that's better than nothing.
There, there, there.
My gracious.
Here are the $5.00 bills,
Mr. Sullivan.
Hello, Johnnie.
Get me two tickets on the midnight plane.
Two tickets? Oh, two tickets!
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.
- They're pretty, aren't they?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you want one?
- Yes.
Here. You can have two of them.
Did you cancel the plane tickets?
They cancel themselves. I'm gonna give him just 15 minutes more, and then...
I'm sure he's all right.
He probably got interested in a revival meeting or something and...
Hello? Yes, Doc.
Not in the hospitals, huh?
Sure. I guess that's all you can do.
Anyway, he didn't have an accident.
Oh?
He isn't, huh?
Val has covered the police stations.
- Okay.
- I guess you can come back now.
I should have gone with him.
I knew he'd get into trouble without me.
- I told him that...
- I'll gonna give him just 12 minutes more,
Then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap and let him figure it out.
- Sully'll be awfully sore if you...
- Let him be sore.
I got a job too, you know.
If LeBrand ever found out...
He came back the last time.
He didn't have reservations on a plane or people waiting.
- You don't know him like I know him.
- Is that so?
I guess I know him better than...
- Yeah?
- Say, I'm down here to the morgue.
They got a guy in a basket.
You can't tell who he is.
Did the boss have any identification?
Did he have any identification that you know of?
Well, he had...
I think he said he had... Who is that?
- Have they found him?
- Take it easy. We gotta check everywhere.
- What identification did he have?
- In the soles of his shoes...
I think there was a card between the soles of his shoes.
Look in the soles of his shoes, between the leather.
He's coming now.
I can hear his footsteps.
There's a card here. It's kind of hard to read. It's all splattered.
- He's dead? What do you mean, he's dead?
- What do you think it means?
What do you send him on jobs like this for? I've got a good mind to sue you.
Do you think I like it any better than you do?
I will sue you!
I'll teach you to... Operator?
Operator, I was talking with Kansas City.
She's gonna sue me.
I suppose I ought to fire the whole bunch of you.
Somehow I don't feel like firing anybody.
Well, there's no use your hanging around here!
Get your things together and leave this afternoon!
- I'll fly back.
- Yes, sir! Uh...
I'd like you to come with us, my dear.
Jones has explained to me.
You were his last discovery... his last gift to the world.
We'll take care of you always.
She didn't hear you.
- What's the idea, riding into the yard?
- Huh?
I said, what's the idea, riding into the freight yard?
Lay off, will you?
I've got a good mind to run you in for trespassing.
Shut up, you dumb cluck.
Can't you see I'm sick?
Come on, get out of here, you dirty rat!
- Go on, go on!
- Don't do that again.
- That's telling him, 'bo.
- Don't do what again?
Come on. Come on, get going!
Trespass. Resisting arrest.
Atrocious assault and battery with intent to kill.
Huh? What?
- What did he say?
- We object, Your Honor.
My client had been injured and denies all knowledge.
Objection overruled.
- Trespass and resisting arrest.
- Object, your honor.
The man was a railroad employee, not an officer of the law.
- Sustained.
- Trespass and atrocious assault.
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection overruled.
Get down to business.
Prisoner at the bar.
Prisoner at the bar!
- Answer when you're spoken to.
- Huh?
- Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Huh?
Guilty or not guilty to trespass and atrocious assault... with a rock upon the person of the employee of the railroad.
I guess I hit him, all right, the way my hand feels.
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.
I'll pay any damages you like.
Sorry.
So you still refuse to give your name?
It'll come back to me in a minute.
I have such an awful headache.
I'm all mixed up.
We plead guilty, Your Honor, with extenuating circumstances... due to temporary insanity, and throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.
Huh? What?
What did he say?
Stand up. Stand up!
Stand up.
Prisoner at the bar, these are parlous times, and we have no desire to be severe.
- Just a minute. I...
- Silence!
When confronted with violence and hoodlumism, the court has no alternative.
Since you still refuse to remember your name...
but have pleaded guilty to trespass and atrocious assault,
I will be as lenient as my conscience permits... and not impose upon you the maximum penalty your crimes ordinarily permit.
Richard Roe, I sentence you to six years at hard labor...
as prescribed by the laws of our sovereign state.
Six years? What's he talking about?
- You got off easy.
- Wait a minute. I gotta get to a phone.
- I have to send a...
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up!
- Come on, come on!
Mister, new man.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi, Jake.
- Put him in 13.
- Just a minute, boys. I want to...
You speak when you're spoken to around here. Hold up your arm and wait.
Listen, you...
You say "Mister" when you're talking to me.
- Put him in 13 and find him a bunk.
- Come on.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Them cost me $16.50.
- Another Richard Roe, eh?
- There seems to be a lot of them.
- How's everything at the house, Charlie?
- Fine, Jake.
- Give my regards to the missus.
- I'll do that little thing.
- I gotta get out of here.
- Take it easy, boy.
I'm John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood director.
Somebody slugged me. I gotta get out of here.
A Hollywood what?
- Take it easy, will you?
You're gonna lose your privilege.
No letters, no smokes, no writing.
You don't want that.
I want a lawyer.
You get me to a telephone.
There's a telephone right down there.
They can't do things like this to people. Put 'em in a pigsty.
Pipe down, will you, please, before he hears.
I want a lawyer. I demand my right to have a lawyer!
Did you hear that?
He demands a lawyer.
You starting in again?
You're gonna be here a long time, see?
And you gotta learn, and learn quick.
Chain him in.
No privilege, fresh guy.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
Good news. You want to see the picture show Sunday?
We're going to the picture show.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
They asked us over again.
- When can I write a letter?
- When you get your privilege back.
How long will that take?
That all depends on the Mister.
He's all right if you take it nice and quiet.
How long does it take him to make up his mind?
Take it easy, will you, or you'll never get it.
Look out!
Who gave you leave to read the paper?
You won't learn, huh?
- It's about me. I just happened to see it.
- Shut up!
Turn around. Turn around!
Put your hands behind you.
- Put him in the sweat box.
- For how long, Mister?
- Till I tell you. Are you gonna start now?
- No. Yes. I mean no, sir.
Then get moving!
Get back to your work. What do you think this is, a vaudeville show?
Tastes good, don't it?
I'll try to get him to let you off early.
I ain't supposed to do this.
- Water.
- You'll be all right.
You got to learn, that's all.
It ain't so easy at first, but after a while you don't mind.
We ain't so bad off.
He ain't bad, according to his lights.
He has to deal with some pretty tough hombres.
He got us chicken last Thanksgiving... and some turkey once for Christmas.
And there ain't another Mister takes his gang to the picture show.
Maybe... Maybe if I ask him, he'll let you go the picture show Sunday.
Wouldn't that be something? Huh?
All right, Charlie.
Let it down easy, Charlie.
Charlie's a little anxious.
Brothers and sisters, once again we're gonna have a little entertainment.
I don't have to tell you what it is.
The sheet kind of gives it away.
And once again, brothers and sisters, we're going to share our pleasure... with some neighbors less fortunate than ourselves.
Won't you please clear the first three pews so they may have seats.
And when they get here,
I'm gonna ask you once more, neither by word, nor by action, nor by look... to make our guests feel unwelcome.
Don't draw away from them or act high-toned.
- For we is all equal in the sight of God.
- Amen!
And He said,
"Let him who is without sin...
" cast the first stone.
"The chains shall be struck from them!
"The lame shall leap.
"The blind shall see!
And glory in the coming of the Lord. "
Let's give our guests a little welcome.

Will those nearest to the lights kindly rise and dim them, please.
How do?
- Hey.
- Huh?
Am I laughing?
You don't suppose this is a gag, do you?
He'd have to be a Houdini to get out of that one.
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.
Don't you understand?
They think I'm dead, and I'm not dead.
Well, that's fine.
Just think what a nice surprise they'll have when you get out.
I haven't time to spend six years.
- But you were sentenced.
- I know that, but I still haven't time.
Well, you'll have to find the time.
Look they don't sentence picture directors to a place like this... for a little disagreement with a yard bull.
- Don't they?
- No.
Oh.
Well, then, maybe you ain't a movie director.
Huh?
Maybe that idea just come to you...
- when you got hit on the head, maybe.
- Now, look...
We used to have a fella here once that thought he was Lindbergh.
He used to fly away every night... but he was always back in the morning.
Don't I look like a picture director?
'Course I never seen one.
You look more like a soda jerk, or maybe a plasterer, maybe.
But...
If ever a plot need a twist, this one does.
Huh?
- I gotta get my picture in the paper.
- That would be swell.
Then you could paste it over your bunk.
What kind of people get their pictures in the paper?
Ball players?
Girls? They take 'em with their legs crossed.
I cut one out once. She had a...
She was sitting... No?
When you die, if you was important enough.
I've had that.
Murderers?
There was a swell picture of a friend of mine.
He was a lodge brother.
They called him
"the blowtorch killer. "
That's it. That's it!
You tell the Mister I'm ready to make a full confession.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.
- Now, take it easy.
- There isn't a moment to lose.
- Now, look...
- I'm... My conscience has got me.
You're gonna get...
I want to confess to the murder of John L. Sullivan.
- Wait a minute!
- I killed John L. Sullivan!
I killed John L.
Sullivan!
I'm telling you, you're doing the wrong thing.
- I'm a murderer!
- Will you listen to me before somebody...
I killed John L. Sullivan!
- I'm so happy.
- So am I!
- I said, I'm so happy!
- What?
Your wife got married last week.
Who got buried last week?
She got married last week!
My wife?
You say they buried her?
No, she got married.
She married your business manager.
- She married him?
- Yes!
- He married her?
- Yes!
- But how?
- Because you were dead.
- Dead?
- Dead.
- Do you suppose she'll give you a divorce?
- Give it to me?
She'll beg me for it. Don't you understand? She's got to give it to me.
Otherwise it's bigamy, unfaithfulness, alienation of affection, corpus delicti.
- And then you'll be free.
- Then I'll be free.
But not for long, I hope.
Just a moment, gentlemen!
Sully, I just want to tell you that
O Brother, Where Art Thou? is gonna be the greatest tragedy ever made.
- Well, I...
- The world will weep! Humanity will sob.
It'll put Shakespeare back with the shipping news.
Quiet! Your personal courage, your sacrifice... the lengths to which you went to sample the bitter dregs of vicissitude...
will make O Brother, Where Art Thou? positively...
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- You're sorry to disappoint me?
Yes, and I say it with some embarrassment,
but I don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
You don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
No. I say it with some embarrassment.
I want to make a comedy.
You say it with some embarrassment?
He doesn't want to make O Brother, Where
Art Thou? He wants to make a comedy.
He don't mean that, boss.
He's still a little stir crazy.
- Oh, yes, I do. Oh, no I'm not!
- You're joking, aren't you?
- It's in bad taste, but it's a joke?
- No.
But it's had more publicity than the Johnstown flood.
- What are we gonna do?
- Oh, brother.
Why don't you want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou, Sully?
In the first place, I'm too happy to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
In the second place, I haven't suffered enough to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
- You haven't suffered enough?
- He hasn't suffered enough?
- But Sully!
- I'll tell you something else.
There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.
Did you know that's all some people have?
It isn't much, but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.
Boy.

Silence. Be upstanding in court.
All persons who have anything to do before my lords, the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping for a bit of sun for our homecoming.
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate the sunshine. Is there a draught?
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.
We've been flat on our back for two months, we'd better be careful.
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely to live and work in the Inns of Court.
How lucky you lawyers are.
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy and we became engaged as soon as he could sit up.
And then peritonitis set in and he went like that.
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.
Oh, shut up!
Williams, my cane.
Here he comes!
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like to read you a poem to welcome you back.
Very touching. You can recite it after office hours in your own time.
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing. I'm just happy that you're your old self again.
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know, he was expelled for conduct unbecoming a cardiac patient.
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm not a religious man, but when they carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.
If anything happened to you, what would happen to me, after 37 years?
37 years! Has it been all that long?
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.
The chemist accused of putting cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.
First time I rose to make an objection, my wig fell off. Where's my wig?
Right here.
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.
What's all this?
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?
Of course. The solicitors have been breaking down our doors.
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.
Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an important marine insurance claim.
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake any criminal cases. Your doctors have...
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.
If only they'd let me do something worthwhile!
Sorry, sir.
Might as well get a bigger box, more mothballs, put me away too.
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now, get undressed and lie down.
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,
I seriously considered strangling you with one of your own rubber tubes.
I would then have admitted the crime, retained myself for the defence.
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby enter a plea of justifiable homicide.
For four months this alleged ángel of mercy has pored, probed, punctured, pillaged and plundered my helpless body while tormenting my mind with a steady drip of baby talk.
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.
Take your hands off me, or I'll strike you with my cane.
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place.
We called him Wilfrid the fox.
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?
No. Upstairs.
A few puffs after meals? Please.
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer and plunge it between her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've installed something for you here. It's a lift.
A lift? I'm sick of this plot to make me a helpless invalid.
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.
Here you are. Simply press this button for up and this one for down.
Carter, I warn you, if this contraption should collapse, if the barrister should fall off the bannister...
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?
I didn't make an appointment, but this is urgent.
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.
I'm sure he'll want this brief.
Serious criminal matter.
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.
He can't accept anything of an overstimulating nature.
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.
Hello. Distressing news about your health.
It's tragic. You'd better get a man with younger arteries.
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when you've something not too stimulating.
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.
Mayhew! Mayhew!
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.
Don't worry, we won't take the brief, but an old friend needs help.
Surely I can give him a word of advice.
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!
You go ahead. Start it without me.
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.
Seems silly to me, but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?
Well, for murder.
Oh!
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.
Middle-aged widow, well-off, living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.
When the housekeeper returned, she found her dead, struck on the back of the head and killed.
Vole seems caught in a web of circumstantial evidence.
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd suggest the strongest line of defence.
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.
No previous convictions. He's of good character with an excellent war record.
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.
The defence may turn on establishing an alibi for the night of the murder.
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.
This will take all our cunning.
Young man!
Come here, please.
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able to enlighten me on an important point.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face if she saw me now?
Then let's make absolutely sure that she doesn't.
Splendid. All the instincts of a skilled criminal.
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.
Whether or not you murdered a middle-aged widow, you certainly saved the life of an elderly barrister.
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.
Only a barrister can actually plead a case in court.
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had been found dead with her head bashed in.
It also said the police were anxious to interview me since I visited that evening.
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement and said they'd write it down and it might be used against me. Is that a caution?
Well, it can't be helped now.
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.
He thinks that he made a statement and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious that you will be regarded as the principal suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?
This is England! You don't get arrested or convicted for crimes you haven't done.
We try not to make a habit of it.
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?
Of course. There was that case of that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.
In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap.
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.
He received a pardon, a bounty from the crown, and was restored to normal life.
That's all right for him. What if it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?
How would they have restored him to his normal life then?
Mr Vole, you must not take such a morbid point of view.
It's just when you say these things are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest, most experienced barrister in London.
Let's get this straight. I may have done something highly unethical.
I've taken your cigar but I'm not taking your case. I can't.
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.
But if you'd like the case handled by these chambers,
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.
Hold this.
Carter?
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here as soon as he comes in from court.
Sir Wilfrid, I have never known such insubordination.
Not even as a nurse during the war.
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.
You'll like Brogan-Moore, he's had excellent training. Under me.
This morning I had no lawyers at all and now suddenly I have three.
We should explain that I have very little money.
I shan't be able to pay all the costs and fees.
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?
I worked in a department store, in toys, demonstrating children's building sets.
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.
It's true, in a way, but I'm really not like that.
My army service unsettled me. That and living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle down now I've come back to this country.
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.
Pocket pencil sharpeners, key chain flashlights.
But my best is really this eggbeater.
It not only beats, it also separates the yolk from the white.
Is that really desirable?
If you were a housewife, you'd see it right away.
The trouble is, I need money for manufacturing and promotion.
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.
It was 3 September. I remember because it's my wife's birthday.
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street, daydreaming about what I'd buy for her, if I had any money.
- You really like this one?
- Very much.
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't recommend it to every woman. But you?
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?
Absolutely. But if I could suggest one little thing.
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back a bit like that. Show more of your face.
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...
You buy that hat. I insist.
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat - a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.
I'm constantly surprised that women's hats do not provoke more murders.
Go on, please.
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good.
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.
Again, by accident. I was peddling my eggbeaters and business was a little slow.
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.
Thank you. It's such a bother taking it off and putting it back on again.
That chap is Jesse James. They've led him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.
Sometimes I see the same one two or three times. Ooh.
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
At this time you had no idea that Mrs French was well-off?
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.
All I knew was she seemed to be very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.
She and her husband lived abroad in British Nigeria.
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.
Well, they finally polished off Jesse James, and after we left the movie she invited me to her house for tea.
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.
But this beats so quickly and it separates too!
It must be cen-trifugal or centrifugal, which is it?
It's specific gravity, but it whips cream too.
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.
We must have one. Is it expensive?
Compliments of the inventor, manufacturer and sole distributor.
Thank you. We'll use it constantly, won't we, Janet?
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.
Ha!
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?
Why not?
This is a charming room.
Hubert and I collected all these things when we lived in Africa.
Hubert was my husband.
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.
That's the mask of the witch doctor.
He wore it when he pulled our servants' teeth.
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.
Oh, here's tea.
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle, the one we bought last Christmas.
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted egg in the kitchen ready and separated.
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.
Oh, is she? I thought she came with the collection.
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.
I feel like Christmas, somehow.
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.
We'd talk, play canasta, listen to gramophone records,
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.
It's so weird to think of her now, lying in that living room, murdered.
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful, and unsanitary.
Tell Sir Wilfrid about the evening of the murder.
I went around to see her about eight o'clock.
She fixed a sandwich, we talked, listened to The Mikado.
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out of court, in the witness box, anywhere!
How much money did you get from Mrs French?
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.
That's ridiculous. She liked me.
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!
But you never took your wife along when you went there. Why not?
- Because...
- Because what?
Because she was under the impression we didn't get along too well.
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.
Because she was rich, and you were after her money.
Well, yes, in a way.
I was hoping for a loan for my new invention. Just a few hundred pounds.
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?
You knew it was the housekeeper's day off?
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?
No, because I thought she might be lonely.
All right, lonely. You and the rich lonely widow all alone in that house with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.
Perhaps you turned up the volume to drown her cries.
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.
The house had been ransacked! It said in the papers. It must've been a burglar.
I didn't do it. No matter how bad things look, I didn't do it!
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?
I do now, but I wasn't sure.
That's why I subjected your eyes and my arteries to that ordeal.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
As for things looking bad, they don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to work on a clock I've been tinkering with.
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a devoted wife does not carry much weight.
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.
Your line of defence, however, will be lack of motive.
You will agree that we can rule out a crime of passion, hm?
That leaves us with a murder for profit.
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg, why kill the goose before it was laid?
No motive. No motive whatsoever.
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole very responsive and quite candid.
So candid, he's already told me we'll have to sue him for our fees.
Oh, we'll simply put a lean on Mr Vole's £80,000.
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.
Left me?
They opened Mrs French's bank vault today and found her will.
- Congratulations.
And I was worried about a couple of hundred for that silly eggbeater.
I must call Christine.
Oh.
This doesn't make things look any better for me, does it?
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.
They will indeed. £80,000 makes for a very handsome motive.
I thought you were crazy but now they will arrest me!
It's not unlikely.
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea she'd any intention of leaving me money.
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.
Chief Inspector? They must think a lot of you at Scotland Yard.
You're getting the de luxe treatment.
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.
I have a warrant for your arrest on the charge of murdering Emily French.
I must warn you that anything you say may be taken down and used in evidence.
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?
That won't be necessary, sir.
I've never been arrested before, not even for walking a dog off a lead
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops, even barristers have stood in the dock.
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.
One thing I've learned for sure, never look in a window with women's hats.
Good day, sir.
Makes a very nice impression, doesn't he?
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.
Of course. The prosecution will blast in with their heaviest artillery.
All you'll have is one little popgun, an alibi furnished by his wife.
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?
I think I'd like it more if it was less of a challenge and less intriguing.
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.
Splendid. Give her a month's pay and kick her down the stairs.
Either you take care of yourself or I, too, shall resign.
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.
For my first day this has already been rather hectic. I should be in bed.
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole and have her come over. Will you sit in?
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope with emotional wives drenched in tears.
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look, waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.
Take me, I'm yours.
Oh!
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently, especially when you tell her of the arrest.
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare for hysterics, even a fainting spell.
Better have smelling salts ready, box of tissues and a nip of brandy.
I do not think that will be necessary.
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully, and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes.
I'm Christine Vole.
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.
How do you do?
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid we have bad news for you.
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.
Leonard has been arrested and charged with murder. Is that it?
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?
Your husband will have to stand trial, I'm afraid.
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.
Oh?
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.
My health, or, rather, the lack of it, forbids me.
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described you as champion of the hopeless cause.
Is it, perhaps, that this cause is too hopeless?
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It was a mistake to let you come back here.
I should have taken you to a rest-home or a resort.
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.
Shut up. You just want to see me in those nasty shorts.
Come now, Sir Wilfrid, you must not think of it.
You must get ready for sleep, think beautiful thoughts.
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on, tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.
After your rest we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.
Then perhaps we'll have a walk around the square.
You know, I feel sorry for that nice Mr Vole.
And not just because he was arrested, but that wife of his. She must be German.
That's what happens when we let our boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.
The government should do something about foreign wives. Like an embargo.
How else can we take care of our own surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?
All right. Hop in!
Sir Wilfrid?
Sir Wilfrid!
Come back!
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.
Go on.
I knew when he came home with a pair of green socks she'd knitted for him.
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green and the socks were two sizes too large, but he wore them just the same to give her pleasure.
Leonard has a way with women.
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?
Yes. A lot of money.
Of course, your husband had no previous knowledge of this bequest?
Is that what he told you?
Surely you're not suggesting different?
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.
Clearly, she had come to look upon your husband as a son or favourite nephew.
You think Mrs French looked upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?
I do. An entirely natural and understandable relationship.
What hypocrites you are in this country.
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.
You realise your husband's entire defence rests on his word and yours?
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical of the word of a man accused of murder when supported only by that of his wife?
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.
I assume you want to help your husband?
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.
There. Isn't that more comfortable for you?
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.
On the night of the murder your husband came home before 9.30. Correct?
Precisely. Isn't that what he wants me to say?
Isn't it the truth?
Of course.
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts we accept the evidence of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian and who must have an interpreter.
We accept the evidence of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all, as long as they tell the truth.
You're aware that when you're in the witness box you will be sworn
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely and did not go out again.
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Is that better?
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?
Whatever your gambit may be, do you know that, under British law, you cannot be called to give testimony damaging to your husband?
How very convenient.
We are dealing with a capital crime.
The prosecution will try to hang your husband.
He is not my husband.
Leonard and I went through a form of marriage, but I had a husband living somewhere in East Germany, in the Russian zone.
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.
But he did marry you and brought you safely here.
Don't you think you should be grateful?
One can get very tired of gratitude.
Your husband loves you very much, does he not?
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.
And you?
You want to know too much.
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing.
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.
And you're satisfied, I hope?
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?
That woman's up to something. But what?
The prosecution will break her down in no time when she's in the witness box.
This case is going to be rather like the charge of the Light Brigade or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.
With the odds all on the other side.
I haven't got much to go on, have I?
The fact is, I've got nothing.
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?
Do you?
Do you?
I'm not sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.
I'll take it from here.
I have called Dr Harrison and given him a report on your shocking behaviour.
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!
Did you hear me? A match!
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are going to represent me. I'm very grateful.
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?
This is what you were wearing that night.
We'll circulate a photo on the chance that someone saw you on your way home.
Over here against the wall, please.
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.
Do we really need this? My wife knows what time I came home that night.
A disinterested witness may be of more value.
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.
Mayhew, give me the reports.
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?
I want to read a portion of the evidence of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French with her business affairs, particularly her income tax returns."
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms are very complicated.
There's also a hint you may have helped her draft her new will.
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.
She was always against me,
I don't know why!
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into the wheels of her Victorian household.
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.
But that was two days after. Christine was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.
Wives are often profoundly disturbed at such a time.
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?
In Germany in 1945.
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.
Come on!
? Join the party
? Have a hearty glass of rum
? Don't ever think about tomorrow
? For tomorrow may never come
? When I find me a happy place
? That's where I wanna stay
? Time is nothing as long as I'm living it up this way
? I may never go home any more
? Dim the lights and start locking the door
? Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me
? After all that's what sailors are for
? I've got kisses and kisses galore
? That have never been tasted before
? If you treat me right
This could be the night
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home any more
? I may never go home any more
Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.
They rob you blind and then throw you a ruddy sailor!
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!
All right, Fräulein, if you won't show 'em, I will.
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Bring him round to the other truck.
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!
Gesundheit.
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.
Oh, let me help you.
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.
I'm terribly sorry.
You better go. We've had trouble enough.
Well, it's your own fault. That costume in the picture gave the boys ideas
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.
Then raid by raid, my other dresses, and now you've bombed my trousers.
Cigarette? Gum?
You're burning my nose.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.
How much?
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.
Got any hot water at your place?
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?
Nearby.
Come.
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.
She has a Ford automobile.
Make yourself comfortable, the stove is slow these days.
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.
No, not that chair. It holds up the beam and that holds up the ceiling.
You'd better sit down on the cot.
The cot?
Getting more gemütlich all the time.
Are you married?
- Why?
- Well, the, um...
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.
But it's getting better.
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.
Is that a fair rate of exchange?
Very fair.
Would you be interested in having the whole tin?
I would.
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.
Milk?
Sure.
Milk. Sugar.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Yeah.
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.
Don't worry, we'll work out something, like an instalment plan.
? I may never go home any more
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.
Maybe I can fix it.
I'm good at it.
I had a weekend pass, a month's pay in my pocket.
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.
We got married. When I got out of the service I brought her here.
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.
First time she saw it, she was so happy she broke down and cried.
Naturally. She had a solid roof over her head and a British passport.
You don't know her, how she feels about me. You will when she gives evidence.
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.
You're not? Why not?
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar with the subtleties of our language.
The prosecution could easily trip her up.
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll is waiting in the car with her pills
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.
For no other reason than I'm a mean, ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.
Let us wish each other luck.
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.
Yes. Like a drowning man clutching at a razor blade.
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are charged on indictment for that you, on the 14th day of October, in the county of London, murdered Emily Jane French.
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Members of the jury, the prisoner stands indicted for that he, on the 14th day of October, murdered Emily Jane French.
To this indictment he has pleaded not guilty.
And it is your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether he be guilty or not.
Members of the jury, by the oath which you have just taken, you have sworn to try this case on the evidence.
You must shut out from your minds everything except what will take place in this court.
You may proceed for the prosecution, Mr Myers.
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,
I appear in this case with my learned friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore appear for the defence.
I trust we are not to be deprived of the learned and stimulating presence of Sir Wilfrid?
My lord, may I assure my learned friend that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.
He's slightly incapacitated, but will be in his seat presently.
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.
You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed with the case for the prosecution.
Thank you, my lord.
The facts in this case are simple and, to a point, not in dispute.
You will hear how the prisoner made the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French, a woman of 56.
How he was treated by her with kindness and even affection.
On the night of October 14 last, between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.
Medical testimony will be introduced to prove that death was caused by a blow from a blunt and heavy instrument, and it is the case for the prosecution that the blow was dealt by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
That's not true! I didn't do it!
Among the witnesses, you will hear police evidence, also the evidence of Mrs French's housekeeper, Janet McKenzie, and from the medical and laboratory experts, and the evidence of the murdered woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.
It may interest you to know that I am descended from a warrior family which traces its brave past back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.
You're to have a calcium injection daily,
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.
Any pain or shortness of breath, pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.
Carter, I'd better take that Thermos of cocoa with me.
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.
My learned patient is not above substituting brandy for cocoa.
It is cocoa. So sorry.
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.
Take care of this, Carter.
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom, you must avoid overexcitement.
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe, what with the pills and the cocoa.
Come along, Carter.
From the body temperature and other factors, we placed the time of death at between 9.30 and 10pm, approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.
Death was instantaneous, caused by one blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.
Were there any signs of a struggle?
None. Just the one blow.
Would that indicate that the murderer had taken Mrs French by surprise?
My lord, I must object.
My learned friend refers to the assailant as "the murderer".
We have not yet determined whether the assailant was a man or a woman.
It could quite conceivably have been "the murderess".
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in time to catch you on a point of grammar.
Please rephrase your question.
Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it your opinion that the assailant, whether he, she or it, had taken Mrs French by surprise?
My lord, I am taken by surprise that my learned friend should try to solicit from the witness an opinion, not a fact.
Quite so. You'll have to do better than that, Mr Myers.
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.
- Is that better?
- That's much better.
Silence! Silence!
Very well, Inspector, let us proceed with the facts.
After establishing the cause and the time of death, what did you then do?
A search was made, photographs were taken and the premises fingerprinted.
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French, those of Janet McKenzie, and some which later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.
- No others?
- No others.
Did you say the room had the appearance that a robbery had been committed?
Yes. Things were strewn about and the window had been broken near the catch.
There was glass on the floor, and fragments were found outside.
The glass outside was not consistent with the window being forced from the outside.
You're saying that someone made it look as if it had been forced from the outside?
My lord, I must object. My learned friend is putting words in the witness' mouth.
After all, if he insists on answering his own questions, the presence of the witness would seem superfluous.
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?
Yes, my lord.
Inspector, did you ascertain if any of the murdered woman's property was missing?
According to the housekeeper, nothing was missing.
In your experience, Inspector, when burglars or burglaresses break into a house, do they leave without taking anything?
No, sir.
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.
Is that the jacket?
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.
Where did you find this, Inspector?
That is the jacket found in the prisoner's flat, which I handed to our lab to test for bloodstains.
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.
Though an attempt had been made to wash them out.
What tests were made?
First to determine if the stains were human blood, then to classify it by group or type.
And was the blood of a particular group or type?
Yes, sir. It is type O.
And did you subsequently test the blood of the dead woman?
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?
The same. Type O.
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints you found were those of Mrs French,
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.
In your experience, when a burglar breaks in, does he usually leave fingerprints
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.
So the absence of fingerprints in a robbery
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.
Can't we surmise the burglar might have entered a presumably empty house, suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her, then, realising she was dead, fled without taking anything?
I submit, my lord, that it is entirely impossible to guess what went on in the mind of some entirely imaginary burglar.
With or without gloves.
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid, but confine ourselves to facts.
Inspector, when you questioned the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket, did he not show you a recently-healed scar on his wrist,
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.
And were you not told the same thing by his wife?
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife and tell you that her husband had cut his wrist while slicing bread?
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.
Just test the edge of it with your finger. Carefully!
You agree that the point and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip, might it not inflict a cut that would bleed profusely?
Yes, sir, it might.
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains on the prisoner's jacket were analysed, as was the blood of Mrs French, and they were both found to be of group O.
- That is correct.
- However, if the prisoner's blood were also of this same group, then the stains on his jacket may well have resulted from the household accident he described to you.
Yes, sir.
Did you examine the prisoner's blood, Inspector?
No, sir.
I have here a certificate stating that Leonard Stephen Vole is a blood donor at the North London Hospital.
And that his blood is group O.
Thank you, Inspector.
Inspector, granted that the cut on the wrist was caused by that knife, is there anything to show whether it was an accident or done deliberately after the murder to account for the bloodstains?
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.
You may stand down.
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence...
...the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,
I've moved in with my niece at 19 Glenister Road.
You were companion-housekeeper to the late Mrs Emily French?
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions, poor feckless bodies, afraid of a bit of honest domestic work.
I meant you were on friendly terms, not altogether those of mistress and servant.
Aye. Ten years I was with her and looked after her.
She knew me and she trusted me.
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.
Please tell us, in your own words, about the events of the evening of October 14.
It was a Friday and my night out. I was going to see my niece at Glenister Road, which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.
I promised to take her a dress pattern that she admired.
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.
However, it has been installed at considerable expense to the taxpayers, so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.
So after supper I slipped back to get it as it was no distance.
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.
I let myself in and went upstairs to my room.
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.
No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
Talking and laughing they were.
But it was no business of mine, so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.
You say that you re-entered the house at 25 past 9?
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my room next to my clock so I saw the time.
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.
I went back to my niece. Och, she was delighted with the pattern. Si...
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11, then I said good night and I come home.
I went into the sitting room to see if the mistress wanted anything before she went to bed.
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.
Did you really think that a burglary had been committed?
My lord, I must protest!
I will not allow that question to be answered, Mr Myers.
Miss McKenzie, were you aware that Leonard Vole was a married man?
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.
What Mrs French knew or did not know is pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and the one about Disraeli and his wife.
Both of them about women that married men years younger than themselves. Oh!
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.
Why?
Members of the jury, it is possible for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli without contemplating marriage with a man younger than herself.
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?
She had her old will revoked and a new one drawn up.
I heard her calling Mr Stokes, her solicitor.
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.
You heard Mrs French and the prisoner discussing her new will?
Yes. He was to have all her money, she told him, as she had no near relations nor anybody that meant to her what he did.
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.
One week to the day before she was murdered.
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.
Would you...? Thank you.
Miss McKenzie, you have given evidence about two wills.
In the old will, that which was revoked, were you not to receive the bulk of Mrs French's estate?
That's so.
Whereas in the new will, except for a bequest to you of a small annuity, the principal beneficiary is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
It'll be a wicked injustice if he ever touches a penny of that money.
It is entirely understandable that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.
I'm not antagonistic to him.
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.
I suggest you formed this opinion because his friendship with Mrs French cost you the bulk of her estate.
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.
Now. On the night of October 14 you say you heard the prisoner and Mrs French talking together.
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.
You mean you only heard the voices?
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.
What makes you say the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern so you probably walked quickly past the closed door, yet you are sure you heard Leonard Vole's voice?
I was there long enough to hear what I heard.
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest to the jury that you were eavesdropping.
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?
What you mean is that you wanted it to be him. That's the way your mind worked.
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes watch television in the evening?
Yes. She was fond of a talk or a good play.
Wasn't it possible when you returned home and passed the door, what you really heard was the television and a man and woman's voices and laughter?
There was a play called Lover's Leap on the television that night.
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?
Because the television was away being repaired that week, that's why.
Silence! Silence!
Odd. It's not time yet.
If my learned friend has no further questions, I'd like...
I have not quite finished.
You are registered, are you not, under the National Health Insurance Act?
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay.
I am sure that many agree with you.
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply to the National Health Insurance for...
-... a hearing aid?
- For... for what?
I protest against the way in which this question was put!
I will repeat the question, my lord.
I asked you in a normal tone of voice, audible to everyone in open court, did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?
Yes, I did.
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.
However, you state that you walked past a door, which is four inches of solid oak, you heard voices, and you are willing to swear that you could distinguish the voice of...
... the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
Who? Who?
No further questions.
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.
Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the rubbish that is being talked nowadays, you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.
Call Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?
No, my lord. I now call the final witness for the prosecution, Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.
Christine.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
My lord, I have the most serious objection to this witness being summoned, as she is the wife of the prisoner.
I call my learned friend's attention to the fact that I summoned not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.
And you have been living as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?
No.
I went through a marriage ceremony with him, but I already had a husband.
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!
There is proof of a marriage between the witness and the prisoner, but is there any proof of a so-called previous marriage?
My lord, the so-called previous marriage is, in fact, well-documented.
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm, the ceremony having taken place in Breslau on 18 April 1942?
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.
I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence.
You're willing to give evidence against the man you've been calling your husband?
Yes.
You stated to the police that on the night that Mrs French was murdered,
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30 and returned at 25 minutes past 9.
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!
Silence!
I must have silence.
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly have an opportunity of speaking in your own defence.
Leonard Vole returned, you say, at ten minutes past ten.
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.
He threw off his coat and examined the sleeves.
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?
He said "I've killed her."
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time so that the prisoner may gain control of himself.
My lord is most gracious, but pray let the witness continue.
We are all of us caught up in the suspense of this horror fiction.
To have to hear it in instalments might prove unendurable.
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm, when the prisoner said "I have killed her", did you know to whom he referred?
It was that woman he had been seeing so often.
When questioned by the police, you told them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.
Yes. Because Leonard asked me to say that.
But you've changed your story now. Why?
I cannot go on lying to save him.
I said to the police what he wanted because I'm grateful to him.
He married me and brought me to this country.
What he has asked me to do I have because I was grateful.
It was not because he was your husband and you loved him?
I never loved him.
It was gratitude, then, that prompted you to give him an alibi
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.
That woman, she was a harmless old fool, and he makes of me an accomplice to the murder.
I cannot come into court and swear that he was with me at the time it was done.
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!
Then this is the truth?
That Leonard Vole returned that night at ten minutes past ten, he had blood on the sleeves of his coat, and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?
That is the truth.
That is the truth, before God?
That is the truth.
Thank you.
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which do you prefer to be called?
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?
In this country we are inclined to take a rather more serious view of marriage.
However, it would appear that when you first met the prisoner in Hamburg
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
And in arranging the marriage, you lied to the authorities?
I, um, did not tell the truth to the authorities.
- You lied to them?
- Yes.
And in the ceremony, when you swore to love, honour and cherish your husband,
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.
And when the police questioned you about this wretched man who believed himself married and loved,
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.
You told them that he was at home with you at 25 minutes past 9,
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!
And when you said that he had accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.
The question is, Frau Helm, were you lying then, are you lying now?
Or are you not, in fact, a chronic and habitual liar?!
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.
My lord, is my learned friend to be allowed to bully and insult the witness?
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge and, within the bounds of reason,
I should like the defence to have every latitude.
My lord, may I also remind my learned friend that his witness, by her own admission, has already violated so many oaths that I am surprised the Testament did not leap from her hand when she was sworn here today.
I doubt if anything is to be gained by questioning you any further.
That will be all, Frau Helm.
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the meaning of the English word "perjury"?
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.
It means to swear falsely under oath.
And are you aware, Mrs Helm, that the penalty in this country for perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?
Yes, I'm aware.
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more, is the evidence that you have given the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
So help me, God.
Then that, my lord, is the case for the prosecution.
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.
Silence.
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?
My lord, members of the jury, the prosecution has very ably presented against the prisoner, Leonard Vole, a case with the most overwhelming circumstantial evidence.
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne, who has given his testimony in a fair and impartial manner, as he always does.
He has put before you a clever theory of how this crime was committed.
Whether it is theory or actual fact, however, you will decide for yourselves.
And then you have heard the evidence of Janet McKenzie, a worthy and devoted housekeeper who has suffered two most grievous losses.
One, the death of her beloved mistress and, second, in being deprived of an inheritance of £80,000, which she'd fully expected to receive.
I will not comment further on her evidence, but will express only my deepest sympathy for her in both these... mishaps.
And most damaging of all, the prosecution has produced a surprise witness, one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner brought from the rubble of her homeland to the safety of this country, giving her his love and the protection of his name.
I objected to her testimony because a wife cannot give evidence
harmful to her husband.
But it has been proven that her marriage to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted and you must consider it.
For what it is worth.
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.
We could present, on behalf of the prisoner, witnesses to his character, his war record, the lack of criminal or evil association in his past.
However, only one witness can shed new light on this tragic riddle.
The prisoner himself.
Members of the jury,
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I give will be the truth,
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you not on the night of October 14 last, murder Emily Jane French?
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.
Have you, in fact, concluded your examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?
The prisoner has endured three days of profound mental agony and shock.
The defence feels his faculties should be spared for the cross-examination by my learned friend for the prosecution.
This is not a plea for any indulgence.
I am confident that no matter how searching this may be, the prisoner will withstand it.
At the time you made the acquaintance of Mrs French, were you employed?
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?
No.
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.
Did you know that in her new will, you were the beneficiary of £80,000?
No, I didn't.
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time, did you wear a trench coat and a brown hat?
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?
Yes, sir.
My lord, the defence, in its efforts to establish an alibi for the prisoner, circulated this photograph, hoping to bring forth a witness who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own at the times that he has stated.
Apparently, this splendid effort was without results.
However, the defence will be pleased to learn that, at the last moment, a witness has come forward, and that the prisoner had been seen wearing this coat and this hat.
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the night of the murder but one week before.
On the afternoon of October 8, were you not in a travel agency in Regent Street?
And did you not make inquiries about prices and schedules of foreign cruises?
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise when they can afford to pay for it.
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.
And yet you came to this particular travel agency with a clinging brunette?
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?
My lord, the lady was so described to me.
She was very affectionate with the prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.
Oh.
You then admit that you made inquiries about expensive and luxurious cruises?
How did you expect to pay for such a thing?
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.
On the morning of the very same day, you heard Mrs French change her will,
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!
And in the afternoon, you started plans to dispose of it.
No! It was nothing of the kind.
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.
We had a drink and walked out together.
We passed the window and saw the fancy posters, all blue seas and palm trees.
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went in for fun and I started asking for folders.
Well, the man gave me a funny look because I did look a bit shabby.
Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept asking for the swankiest tours, all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck, but it was just an act!
An act? You knew that in a week you were going to inherit £80,000!
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but... it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought of killing anyone or inheriting any money.
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French should be killed only one week later?
I told you! I didn't kill her!
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.
She seemed remarkably sane and self-possessed.
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.
And the fact, Mr Vole, is that we've only your word for it.
That you left Mrs French's house at the time you say, that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes past 9, and that you did not go out again!
Somebody must have seen me in the street or going in the house!
One would think so. But the only person who did see you come home that night says it was ten past ten and that you had blood on your hands.
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.
You came home at ten past ten!
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!
You killed Emily French!
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.
What?
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.
It'll all be over by the afternoon, and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.
You work it out. You know my shape, you've stabbed it often enough.
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath and your calcium injection.
And there's a lot more packing to be done.
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.
I watched when Frau Helm was on the stand. They didn't like her.
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.
And that travel agency business doesn't help either. Cigar?
No.
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?
I'm not sure.
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.
The only question is why. What's her game? What is she up to? What?
I hope that in your final speech you won't become too emotionally involved.
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.
He's entitled to the best that I can do.
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal for him, I'll make it sitting down.
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill, or two pills, or all of them and the box too.
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.
Well, really, madam!
And what I want to sell 'im, believe me, 'e'll want to buy.
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?
It's about that German wife.
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?
Well, hello, ducky.
What is this you said about Mrs Leonard Vole?
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station at the far end of the bar.
I'll be here for 30 minutes because that's when me train leaves.
If you want the lowdown on that German bag, get yourself here.
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.
You'd better get on over here, and bring plenty of money.
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.
Balderdash.
I'm too old and too sick to go on a wild-goose chase.
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?
Euston Station, where do you think?
Now, sir?
Shortly.
Cigar!
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?
Your bath, your massage, your dinner, your injection!
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?
No need for mine. If I did give you a name it mightn't be the right one, might it?
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.
Now what is this information you allegedly have?
You realise that you're duty-bound to give any evidence that you might have?
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?
Letters. Letters that German wife of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.
Poor bleeder, he's been took in by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.
If we could see these letters, we could advise you as to how pertinent they are.
Well, I don't expect you...
Well, as I say, I don't expect you to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.
If these letters get the boy off, it's £100 for me, right?
If these letters contain information useful to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £10.
What? Ten bleeding pounds for letters like these?
Take that piece of glass out o' yer eye. Good night.
If these help prove my client's innocence,
£20 should, I think, not be an unreasonable sum for your expenses.
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.
- All right, blast yer.
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.
How do we know these are from Mrs Vole?
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.
Good heavens, look at this.
Juicy, ain't they?
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?
What's the difference so long as she gets what's coming?
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!
I'll give you something to dream about, mister.
Want to kiss me, ducky?
Ha!
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.
Then she come along, started seeing 'im on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.
I found 'em together. I said what I thought of 'er and he cut me face up proper.
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im away from me, turnin' 'im against me.
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another £5 for the letters.
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.
Unbelievable.
We'd better have the full name of the man to whom these were addressed, Miss...
Miss, um...
Where is she?
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?
Good idea.
Silence!
Be upstanding in court.
All persons who have anything to do before my lords, the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.
Since the defence has called but one witness, the prisoner, it has the right to be heard last.
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have the final address for the prosecution.
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech because I think we've proved so obvious a case of murder against Leonard Vole, that a verdict of guilty must be the only possible conclusion.
I will briefly summarise these facts...
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.
That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all interested in our proceedings.
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for the crown, however, is premature.
I ask that the case for the defence be reopened. And that a witness be recalled.
I most strenuously object to the case being reopened at this final stage.
Evidence of a startling nature has come into my possession.
The course my learned friend proposes is quite unprecedented.
I have anticipated this objection and can meet it with ample precedent.
There is the king vs Stillman, reported in the criminal appeal reports of 1926 at page 463.
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one of the king's bench division reports,
1942 at page 153.
And lastly there is the case of the king vs Sullivan in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember, since you appeared for the prosecution.
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?
Letters, my lord.
Letters written by Christine Helm.
My lord, the prosecution continues its objection.
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection in the king against Sullivan was sustained.
Your memory, for once, serves you ill, Mr Myers.
My objection then was overruled by Mr Justice Swindon.
As yours is now, by me.
Call Christine Helm.
Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.
Mrs Helm, you appreciate you are still under oath?
Yes.
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.
It's a simple question. Do you or do you not know a man called Max?
Max? Certainly not.
It's a fairly common name and yet you've never known a man named Max?
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.
- What have you got there?
- A letter.
I suggest that on October 20
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
...addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.
The letter was but one of a series written to the same man.
Lies! All lies!
You seem to have been, well, let us say, on intimate terms with this man.
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!
I'm not concerned with the general trend of this correspondence, only one letter.
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened."
"I believe all our difficulties may be ended."
I will not stand here and listen to a pack of lies!
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!
- It isn't?
- No!
I write my letters on small blue paper with my initials on it.
Like this?
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him and that's what he is.
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough to identify your letter paper.
Now, if you like, I can have an expert identify your handwriting.
Damn you!
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!
Usher, get the witness a chair.
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter in question so that the jury may hear it?
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened."
"All our difficulties may soon be solved."
"Leonard is suspected of murdering the old lady I told you about."
"His only hope of an alibi depends on me and me alone."
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home with me at the time of the murder, that he came home with blood on his sleeves, and that he even admitted to me that he'd killed her?"
"Strange that he always said he would never let me leave him."
"But now, if this succeeds, he will be leaving me because they will take him away forever and I shall be free and yours, my beloved."
"I count the hours until we are together. Christine."
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?
I now ask you again, Christine Helm, did you write this letter?
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?
Before answering, Mrs Helm,
I wish to warn you that the law regarding perjury in this country is very severe.
If you have already committed perjury in this courtroom,
I strongly advise you not to add to your crime.
But, if this letter has not been written by you, then now is the time to state this fact.
I wrote the letter.
And that, my lord, is the case for the defence.
I keep asking which is harder, your head or your arteries?
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.
I concede.
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.
Come on, it's all over, wrapped up neat and tidy.
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy, and altogether too symmetrical, that's what's wrong with it.
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?
It's not their judgment that worries me, it's mine.
Come along.
Where's my wig?
The prisoner will stand up.
Members of the jury, are you all agreed upon your verdict?
We are.
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole, guilty or not guilty of the murder of Emily Jane French?
Not guilty, m'lord.
Silence!
Silence!
Leonard Stephen Vole, you have been found not guilty of the murder of Emily Jane French on October 14.
You are hereby discharged and are free to leave the court.
Persons with anything more to do before the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.
"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr when they charged me.
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago, he had one foot on the gallows and the other on a banana peel.
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows, but there's still that banana peel somewhere, under somebody's foot.
-  Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!
You'd better wait here until we get rid of that crowd, madam.
Thank you.
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.
Let me finish the last of the cocoa while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.
I never thought you British could get so emotional. Especially in public.
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.
I don't mind being called names or pushed around or even kicked in the shin.
But I have a ladder in my last pair of nylons.
In case you are not familiar with our prison regulations, no silk stockings.
Prison? Will I go to prison?
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?
If I were appearing for the prosecution, it would be.
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.
What a wicked woman I am, and how brilliantly you exposed me and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.
What are you driving at?
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.
- We?
- Remember?
When you said that no jury would believe an alibi given by a loving wife, no matter how much she swore he was innocent? That gave me the idea.
What idea?
The idea that I should be a witness, not for my husband, but for the prosecution.
That I should swear Leonard was guilty and that you should expose me as a liar because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.
So now you know the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.
I'll give yer something to dream about, mister.
Want to kiss me, ducky?
I suspected something, but not that.
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.
It's been a long time since I acted and I never played such a vital role.
All those blue letters!
It took me hours to write them, to invent Max. There never was a Max.
There's never been anyone but Leonard.
My dear, could you not have trusted me, worked with me truthfully and honourably? We would have won.
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.
No, Sir Wilfrid, you do not understand at all.
I knew he was guilty.
That can't be true! No!
Listen to me, once and for all.
He came home after ten, he had blood on his sleeves, he said he had killed the woman, only I could save him. He pleaded.
And you saved him? A murderer?
Again, you don't understand.
I love him.
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.
Leonard!
I knew she'd do something, but I just didn't know what or how.
Leonard, Leonard.
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of this alive, let's stay this way.
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.
Who did? You got me off and I can't be tried again for this.
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.
The scales of justice may tip one way or another, but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be lots of money once the will goes through.
I'm not cheap, I want everybody to get something out of it.
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.
And when they try you for perjury there'll be £5,000 for the defence.
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.
Standing in the witness box, having to face you, saying I never loved you.
What is it, Leonard?
The luggage is in the car and we've only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.
Len!
Oh, Len!
Len...
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep me away. It's had me nearly crazy.
Leonard, who's this girl?
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.
Tell her, Len.
Leonard, is this the girl who was with you in the travel bureau?
The girl you said you hardly knew, didn't even know her name?
That's right. That's who I am and I know all about you. You're not his wife.
Never have been. You're years older than he is. We've been together for months and we're going away on a cruise, just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.
I saved your life getting you out of Germany, you got me out of this mess, so we're even. It's over now.
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.
Don't make it worse or they'll try you as an accessory.
And you know what that means.
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me for perjury, or an accessory, or...
- Ready?
- Or better yet... let them try me for...!
Argh!
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.
- What happened?
- She killed him.
Killed him?
She executed him.
Carter, what have you done with the luggage?
I sent it on ahead to the station, and I've got a cab waiting outside.
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.
Better bring the luggage back, and you can dismiss the cab.
We are not going yet, are we?
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers, and Mayhew too.
We're appearing for the defence in the trial of Christine Vole.
Sir Wilfrid?
You've forgotten your brandy.
The management of this theatre suggests
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
October is inventory time, so right now,
Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all
1985-model Toyotas.
You won't find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley.
That's Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley.
The Senate is expected to vote on this today.
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago.
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft.
However, officials now attribute the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.
The FBI, which is investigating the matter, had no comment.
Hey, Doc?
Doc?
Hello! Anybody home?
Einstein, come here, boy.
What's going on? Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus!
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?
Whoa!
Rock 'n' roll.
Yo.
Marty, is that you?
Hey. Hey, Doc.
Where are you?
Thank God
I've found you.
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?
I made a major breakthrough, and I'll need your assistance.
Wait a minute.
1:15 in the morning?
Yeah.
Doc, what's going on?
Where you been all week?
Working.
Where's Einstein?
Is he with you?
Yeah, he's right here.
You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.
My equipment.
That reminds me, Marty.
You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.
1:15 a. m.,
Twin Pines Mall.
Right.
Are those my clocks
I hear?
Yeah, it's 8:00.
Perfect!
My experiment worked!
They're all exactly
25 minutes slow!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?
Precisely.
Damn!
I'm late for school.
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.
Strickland's looking for you.
If you get caught, it'll be four tardies in a row.
All right, come on.
I think we're safe.
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.
Doc?
Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?
Tardy slip for you,
Miss Parker.
And one for you, McFly. I believe that makes four in a row.
Let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man.
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase.
You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.
Ooh. Yes, sir.
You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker.
You remind me of your father when he went here.
He was a slacker, too.
Can I go now,
Mr. Strickland?
I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today.
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.
You're too much like your old man.
No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.
Next, please.
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.
All right.
We're the...
We're the Pinheads.
One, two, three.
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, fellas.
Hold it, fellas.
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.
Next, please.
Bring up the next group, please.
Re-elect Mayor
"Goldie" Wilson.
Progress is his middle name.
"Too loud. "
I can't believe it.
I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good, and this audition tape of yours is great.
You've gotta send it in to the record company.
It's like Doc's always saying. Yeah, I know. I know.
"If you put your mind to it,
"you can accomplish anything. "
That's good advice, Marty.
All right, okay, Jennifer.
What if I send in the tape and they don't like it?
What if they say
I'm no good?
What if they say, "Get out of here, kid. You got no future"?
I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man.
Come on. He's not that bad. Save the clock tower.
At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Check out that 4x4.
That is hot.
Okay. Back her up.
Someday, Jennifer.
Someday.
Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake?
Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back.
Lie out underneath the stars.
Stop it.
What?
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?
No, get out of town.
My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.
Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.
I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.
She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Well, she's not doing a very good job.
Terrible.
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
There you go, lady.
There's a quarter.
Thank you.
Don't forget to take a flyer.
Right.
Save the clock tower!
Where were we?
Right about here.
Jennifer!
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll be at my grandma's.
Here, let me give you the number.
Bye.
Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.
Perfect.
Just perfect.
I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot.
Blind spot? I could've been killed.
Now, Biff, now,
I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it.
Hi, Son.
What, are you blind,
McFly? It's there.
How else do you explain that wreck out there?
Biff, can I assume that your insurance is going to pay for the damage?
My insurance?
It's your car.
Your insurance should pay for it.
I wanna know who's going to pay for this?
I spilled beer all over it when the car smashed into me.
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
Ah...
And where's my reports?
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but I figured since they weren't due till...
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home? Huh?
Think, McFly. Think!
All right.
I got to have time to get them retyped.
Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?
I'll get fired.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
Would you?
Of course not, Biff.
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Now, look. I'll finish those reports on up tonight, and I'll run them on over first thing tomorrow, all right?
Not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.
McFly, your shoe's untied.
Oh.
Don't be so gullible, McFly.
Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.
I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?
What are you looking at, butthead?
Say hi to your mom for me.
I know what you're going to say, Son, and you're right.
You're right.
But Biff just happens to be my supervisor,
And I'm afraid I'm just not very good at confrontations.
But the car, Dad.
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.
Do you have any idea how important this was to me?
Do you have any clue?
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Believe me, Marty, you're better off without having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
He's absolutely right, Marty.
The last thing you need is headaches.
Kids, we're going to have to eat this cake by ourselves.
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.
I think it would be nice if you all dropped him a line.
Uncle
"Jailbird" Joey?
He's your brother, Mom.
Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.
We all make mistakes in life, children.
God damn it.
I'm late.
David, watch your mouth!
You come here and kiss your mother before you go. Come here.
Come on, Mom. Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.
See you later, Pop.
Time to change that oil.
Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service.
While you were outside pouting over the car,
Jennifer Parker called you twice.
I don't like her, Marty.
Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble.
Oh, Mother, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.
When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody?
Well, it'll just happen.
Like the way
I met your father.
That was so stupid. Grandpa hit him with the car.
It was meant to be.
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Yeah, well.
I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
What was it, George?
Bird-watching?
What, Lorraine? What?
Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.
He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've told us this story a million times.
You felt sorry for him, so you decided to go with him to the Fish Under the Sea dance.
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.
Our first date.
I'll never forget it.
It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?
Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor.
It was then that I realized that I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
Hello.
Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Doc.
No. No, don't be silly.
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.
Can you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Yeah. I'm on my way.
Einstein! Hey, Einstein, where's the doc, boy? Huh?
Doc!
Marty! You made it!
Yeah.
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is the big one, the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Well, it's a DeLorean...
Bear with me, Marty. All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.
Doc, is that a DEVO suit?
Never mind that now.
Not now.
All right. I'm ready.
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a. m., and this is temporal experiment number one.
Come on, Einie. Hey, hey, boy, get in there.
That a boy!
In you go. Sit down.
Put your seat belt on.
That's it.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Okay.
Please note that
Einstein's clock is in precise synchronization with my control watch.
Got it?
Right. Check, Doc.
Good.
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.
You got that thing hooked up to the car?
Watch this.
Yeah. Okay. Got it.
Jesus!
Not me!
The car! The car!
If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious shit.
Watch this.
Watch this.
What did I tell you?
88 miles per hour!
The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 a. m.
And zero seconds!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!
Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything.
The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Then where the hell are they?
The appropriate question is,
"When the hell are they?"
You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler.
I sent him into the future.
One minute into the future, to be exact.
At precisely 1:21 a. m.
And zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
The way I see it, if you're going to build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?
Besides, the stainless-steel construction made the flux dispersal...
Look out!
What? Is it hot?
It's cold. Damn cold.
Einstein, you little devil!
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking!
He's all right.
He's fine.
And he's completely unaware that anything happened.
As far as he's concerned, the trip was instantaneous.
That's why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine.
He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.
Come here. I'll show you how it works.
All right.
First, you turn the time circuits on.
This readout tells you where you're going.
This one tells you where you are.
This one tells you where you were.
You input your destination time on this keypad.
Say you want to see the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
Or witness the birth of Christ.
Here's a red-letter date in the history of science.
November 5th, 1955.
Yes, of course.
November 5th, 1955.
What? I don't get it.
What happened?
That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly.
I was standing on the edge of my toilet, hanging a clock.
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink, and when I came to,
I had a revelation, a vision, a picture in my head, a picture of this.
This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
Flux capacitor?
It's taken me almost 30 years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day.
My God, has it been that long?
Things have certainly changed around here.
I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see.
Old man Peabody owned all of this.
He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
This is heavy-duty, Doc.
This is great.
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Unfortunately, no.
It requires something with a little more kick.
Plutonium.
Plutonium.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling. Keep rolling there.
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.
Doc, you don't just walk into a store and buy plutonium.
Did you rip that off?
Of course. From a group of Libyan nationalists.
They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and, in turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.
Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit. Jesus!
We must prepare to reload.
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.
Don't you lose those tapes now.
I need that as a record.
Let's put this back here.
There we go.
I almost forgot my luggage.
Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future?
I'm allergic to all synthetics.
The future?
That's where you're going?
That's right,
25 years into the future.
I've always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind.
Why not?
I'll also be able to see who wins the next 25 World Series.
Doc.
Huh?
Look me up when you get there.
Indeed, I will.
Roll 'em.
I, Dr. Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey.
What am
I thinking of?
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.
How did I ever expect to get back? One pellet, one trip.
I must be out of my mind.
What is it, Einie?
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Who? Who?
Who do you think?
The Libyans!
Holy shit!
I'll draw their fire!
Doc, wait!
No!
You bastard!
Go! Damn Soviet gun.
Go!
Come on!
Move, damn it!
Jesus!
Holy shit!
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.
What is it?
What is it, Pa?
Looks like an airplane without wings.
That ain't no airplane.
Look.
Children!
Listen... Whoa.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Sorry about your barn.
It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!
Get away!
Hold it.
Shoot it, Pa!
My pine! Why you...
You space bastard!
You killed our pine!
All right. All right.
Okay, McFly.
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.
It's just a very intense dream.
Listen, you got to help me.
Don't stop,
Wilbur! Don't!
It can't be.
This is nuts.
Come on.
Perfect.
Remember, fellow citizens, the future is in your hands.
If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.
Progress is his middle name.
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements and lower taxes.
On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader.
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.
This has got to be a dream.
Hey, kid.
What'd you do? Jump ship?
What?
What's with the life preserver?
I just want to use the phone.
Yeah, it's in the back.
Brown.
Great. You're alive.
Come on.
Do you know where
1640 Riverside...
Are you going to order something, kid?
Yeah. Give me a Tab.
Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Right.
Give me a Pepsi Free.
You want a Pepsi, pal, you're going to pay for it.
Just give me something without any sugar in it, okay?
Something without sugar.
Hey, McFly.
What do you think you're doing?
Biff.
I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys.
How are you doing?
You got my homework finished, McFly?
Well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday...
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?
Think, McFly. Think!
Okay.
I got to have time to recopy it.
You realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting?
I'll get kicked out of school.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
Would you?
Now, of course not,
Biff.
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.
What are you looking at, butthead?
Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.
Dork thinks he's going to drown.
How about my homework, McFly?
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll finish that on up tonight and then I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Not too early.
I sleep in Sundays.
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.
I don't want to see you in here again.
Okay. All right.
Bye-bye.
What?
You're George McFly.
Yeah. Who are you?
Say! Why do you let those boys push you around like that for?
Well, they're bigger than me.
Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself.
Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life.
Look at me.
You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Watch it, Goldie.
No, sir!
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school, and one day,
I'm going to be somebody.
That's right.
He's going to be mayor.
Yeah, I'm...
Mayor!
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.
A colored mayor.
That'll be the day.
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.
I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I'm going to clean up this town.
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.
Mayor Goldie Wilson.
I like the sound of that.
Hey, Dad! George!
Hey, you on the bike!
He's a peeping Tom.
Dad!
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who are you?
Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car!
Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!
Mom? That you?
There, there, now. Just relax.
You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
I had a horrible nightmare.
I dreamed that I went back in time. It was terrible.
Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.
You're my...
You're my...
My name is Lorraine.
Lorraine Baines.
Yeah.
But you're...
You're so...
You're so thin!
Just relax, Calvin. You got a big bruise on your head.
Where are my pants?
Over there, on my hope chest.
I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Calvin? Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Well, that is your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein?
It's written all over your underwear.
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
No, actually, people call me Marty.
Oh.
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.
Marty.
Klein.
Do you mind if I sit here?
No. Fine.
No. Good.
Fine. Good.
That's a big bruise you have there.
Lorraine, are you up there?
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!
Quick!
Put your pants back on!
So, tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Excuse me?
I guessed you're a sailor.
That's why you wear that life preserver.
Coast Guard.
Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there.
He's all right.
Thank God.
What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age?
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.
Now, let's see.
You already know Lorraine.
This is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
So, you're my uncle Joey.
Better get used to these bars, kid.
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.
He cries whenever we take him out, so we just leave him in there all the time.
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Listen,
I really ought to...
Sit here, Marty.
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
Look at it roll.
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.
It's our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.
Do you have a television?
Well, yeah. You know we have two of them.
Wow! You must be rich.
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.
Hey. Hey,
I've seen this one.
I've seen this one!
This is a classic.
This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space.
What do you mean, you've seen this? It's brand-new.
Yeah, well,
I saw it on a rerun.
What's a rerun?
You'll find out.
You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?
Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.
You can't.
That is, nobody's home.
Oh.
Yet.
Oh.
Listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.
East end of town.
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.
That's John F.
Kennedy Drive.
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Mother?
With Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he ought to spend the night?
I mean, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
That's true, Marty.
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.
Gee, I don't know.
And he can sleep in my room.
I gotta go!
I gotta go!
Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.
You were all great. See you all later. Much later.
He's a very strange young man.
He's an idiot.
Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too.
Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way,
I'll disown you.
Doc?
Don't say a word.
I don't wanna know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.
Listen, Doc...
Quiet!
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.
Doc, you got to help...
Quiet. Quiet.
I'm going to read your thoughts.
Let's see now. You've come here from a great distance?
Yeah. Exactly.
Don't tell me!
You want me to buy a subscription to the
Saturday Evening Post.
No.
Not a word.
Not a word now!
Quiet.
Donations. You want me to make a donation to the Coast Guard
Youth Auxiliary.
Doc.
I'm from the future.
I came here in a time machine that you invented.
Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
My God.
Do you know what this means?
It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all!
Doc, you got to help me.
You are the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Time machine? I haven't invented any time machine.
Okay. All right,
I'll prove it to you.
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!
I haven't even been born yet.
And look at this picture.
It's my brother, my sister and me.
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.
I'm telling the truth, Doc.
You got to believe me.
Then tell me, future boy,
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?
Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan?
The actor?
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
Whoa. Wait, Doc!
And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury.
Doc, you gotta listen to me.
I've had enough practical jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy!
No, wait, Doc. Doc.
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.
You told me the whole story.
You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell and you hit your head on the sink.
That's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which is what makes time travel possible.
There's something wrong with the starter, so I hid it here.
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.
The flux capacitor.
It works!
It works!
I finally invent something that works!
You bet your ass it works.
Somehow we've got to sneak this back to my laboratory.
We've got to get you home!
Okay, Doc, this is it.
Never mind that.
Never mind that now.
Why, that's me! Look at me! I'm an old man.
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.
Thank God,
I've still got my hair.
What's on Earth is this thing I'm wearing?
This is a radiation suit.
Radiation suit?
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.
This is truly amazing.
A portable television studio.
No wonder your president has to be an actor.
He's gotta look good on television.
Whoa. This is it. This is the part coming up, Doc.
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...
What did I just say?
This sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...
1.21 gigawatts!
1.21 gigawatts.
Great Scott!
What the hell is a gigawatt?
How could I have been so careless? 1.21 gigawatts!
Tom, how am I going to generate that kind of power?
It can't be done, can it?
Doc, look. All we need is a little plutonium.
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
Whoa, whoa.
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here. I got a life in 1985.
I got a girl.
Is she pretty?
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.
Look at this. Look what she wrote here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.
Doc, you're my only hope.
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating
1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
What did you say?
A bolt of lightning.
Unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever going to strike.
We do now.
This is it!
This is the answer.
It says here that a bolt of lightning is going to strike the clock tower at precisely 10:04 p. m.
Next Saturday night!
If we could somehow harness this lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work.
Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future!
Okay, all right.
Saturday's good. Saturday's good.
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out.
You can show me around.
Marty, that is completely out of the question.
You must not leave this house.
You must not see anybody or talk to anybody.
Anything you do can have serious repercussions on future events.
Do you understand?
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Marty, have you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Yeah, well, I might've sort of bumped into my parents.
Great Scott!
Let me see that photograph again of your brother.
Just as I thought. This proves my theory. Look at your brother.
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.
Erased from existence.
Whoa.
They really cleaned this place up. Looks brand-new.
Now remember.
According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting.
If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids.
That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph.
Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.
Sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.
Which one's your pop?
That's him.
Okay.
Okay, you guys.
Very funny. You guys are being real mature.
Maybe you were adopted.
Okay, real mature, guys.
Okay, pick up my books.
McFly.
That's Strickland.
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Shape up, man.
You're a slacker.
Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life?
No.
What did your mother ever see in that kid?
I don't know, Doc.
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.
Hit me with the car.
That's the Florence
Nightingale effect.
It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients.
Go to it, kid.
Hey, George, buddy.
I have been looking all over for you.
You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day?
Oh.
Yeah.
Good.
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.
Lorraine?
Calvin!
I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.
How's your head?
Good. Fine.
Oh. I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Come on!
Isn't he a dreamboat?
Doc, she didn't even look at him.
This is more serious than I thought.
Apparently, your mother is amorously infatuated with you, instead of your father.
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Precisely.
Whoa. This is heavy.
There's that word again.
"Heavy. "
Why are things so heavy in the future?
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?
What?
The only way we're going to get those two to successfully mate is if they're alone together, so you've got to get your father and mother to interact in some sort of social...
What? You mean like a date? Right!
What kind of date?
I don't know.
What do kids do in the '50s?
They're your parents.
You must know them.
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?
Nothing.
Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!
They're supposed to go to this.
That's where they kiss for the first time.
All right, kid.
You stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to that dance.
George, buddy.
Remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine?
What are you writing?
Uh... Stories.
Science fiction stories about visitors coming down to Earth from other planets.
Get out of town! I didn't know you did anything creative.
Let me read some.
Oh. No, no, no, no.
I never let anybody read my stories.
Why not?
Well, what if they didn't like them?
What if they told me
I was no good?
I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
No. No, not hard at all.
So, anyway, George.
About Lorraine.
She really likes you.
She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
All you got to do is go over there and ask her.
What? Right here, right now, in the cafeteria?
What if she said no?
I don't know if I could take that kind of a rejection.
Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Who?
Biff.
Don't kid around.
Come on.
I'm gonna leave.
You want it.
You know you want it.
You know you want me to give it to you.
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Get your meat hooks off of me.
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks off.
Please.
So what's it to you, butthead?
You know, you been looking for a fight.
Since you're new here, I'm going to cut you a break, today.
So, why don't you make like a tree and get out of here.
George!
Why do you keep following me around?
Look, George...
I'm telling you, George, if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,
I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
But I can't go to the dance.
I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theatre.
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine wants to go with you.
Give her a break.
Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you or anybody else on this planet is going to make me change my mind.
Science Fiction Theatre.
Who are you?
Silence, Earthling.
My name is Darth Vader.
I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Hey, George, buddy.
You weren't at school. What have you been doing all day?
I overslept.
Look, I need your help.
I have to ask Lorraine out, but I don't know how to do it.
All right. Okay, listen, keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.
God! How do you...
What made you change your mind, George?
Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
All right, okay.
There she is, George.
Now just go in there and invite her.
Okay. But I don't know what to say.
Just say anything,
George.
Say whatever's natural, the first thing that comes into your mind.
Nothing's coming to my mind.
Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was even born.
What? What?
Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.
Look, tell her destiny brought you together.
Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl you have ever seen in the world.
Girls like that stuff.
What are you doing,
George?
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.
Yeah. Okay, let's go.
Can you take care of that? Right.
Lou, give me a milk.
Chocolate.
Lorraine. My density has popped me to you.
What?
Oh.
What I meant to say was...
Wait a minute. Don't I know you from somewhere?
Yes.
Yes. I'm George.
George McFly.
I'm your density.
I mean, your destiny.
Oh.
Hey, McFly.
I thought I told you never to come in here.
Well, it's going to cost you.
How much money you got on you?
How much do you want, Biff?
All right, punk.
Now I'm going to...
Whoa, whoa, Biff.
What's that?
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.
Whoa, whoa.
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!
Hey!
I'll get it back to you, all right?
You broke it!
Come back here!
Wow. Look at him go!
Get him!
To the car!
Go! Go!
What's that thing he's on?
It's a board with wheels.
He's an absolute dream.
Come on, come on!
Look out for the car!
Whoa!
I'm going to ram him.
Shit!
Ooh!
Thanks a lot, kid.
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.
Where does he come from?
Yeah, where does he live?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Doc?
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.
Fascinating device, this video unit.
Listen, Doc.
You know, there's something
I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.
No man should know too much about his own destiny.
You don't understand.
I do understand.
If I know too much about my own future,
I can endanger my own existence.
Just as you've endangered yours.
You're right.
Now...
Let me show you my plan for sending you home.
Please excuse the crudity of this model.
I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, now.
We run some industrial-strength electrical cable from the top of the clock tower down, suspending it over the street between these two lamp posts.
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time vehicle with this big pole and hook, which runs directly into the flux capacitor.
At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street, driving directly toward the cable, accelerating to
88 miles per hour.
According to the flyer, at precisely lightning will strike the clock tower, electrifying the cable just as the connecting hook makes contact thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor and sending you back to 1985.
All right, now.
Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.
I'll simulate the lightning.
Ready.
Set.
Release.
You're instilling me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Don't worry. I'll take care of the lightning.
You take care of your pop.
By the way, what happened today? Did he ask her out?
I think so.
What did she say?
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.
Hi, Cal... Marty.
Mom. Lorraine.
How did you know
I was here?
I followed you.
Oh. This is my doc...
My uncle,
Doc Brown.
Hi.
Hi.
Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was kind of wondering if you'd ask me to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance on Saturday.
Wow, you mean... You mean nobody's asked you?
No. Not yet.
What about George?
George McFly?
He's kind of cute and all, but not...
Well, I think a man should be strong, so he can stand up for himself and protect the woman he loves.
Don't you?
Yeah.
I still don't understand.
How am I supposed to go to the dance with her if she's already going to the dance with you?
Well, because, George, she wants to go with you.
She just doesn't know it yet.
That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter.
You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, somebody who's gonna protect her.
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight in my entire life.
Look, you're not going to be picking a fight, Dad.
Daddy-o.
You're coming to her rescue, right?
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?
I'm going to be at the dance.
Right. And where am I going to be?
You're gonna be in the car with her.
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00, she's going to get very angry with me.
Why is she going to get angry with you?
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
You mean you're going to go touch her on her...
No. No, George, look.
It's just an act, right?
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling through the parking lot.
You see us struggling in the car.
You walk up, you open the door, and you say...
Your line, George.
Oh!
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!
You really think
I ought to swear?
Yes, definitely.
God damn it,
George, swear.
Okay.
So, now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.
I'm out for the count, right?
And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.
You make it sound so easy.
I just... I wish
I wasn't so scared.
George, there's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is a little self-confidence.
You know, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
...Hill Valley area weather this Saturday night.
Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.
Are you sure about this storm?
Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?
You know, Marty, I'm going to be very sad to see you go.
You've really made a difference in my life.
You've given me something to shoot for.
Just knowing that I'm going to be around to see 1985.
That I'm going to succeed in this!
That I'm going to have a chance to travel through time!
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.
I'm really going to miss you.
Doc, about the future...
No!
Marty!
We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous.
Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically.
Whatever you've got to tell me,
I'll find out through the natural course of time.
"Dear Dr. Brown.
"On the night that
I go back in time,
"you will be
"shot by terrorists.
"Please take whatever precautions are necessary
"to prevent this terrible disaster.
"Your friend,
"Marty. "
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?
Oh, just a little weather experiment.
What you got under here?
No! Don't touch that!
Some new, specialized weather-sensing equipment.
You got a permit for that?
Of course I do.
Just a second. Let me see if I can find it here.
Do you mind if we park for a while?
That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.
Huh?
Marty, I'm almost
18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.
What?
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?
No.
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?
I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.
Why not?
Because you...
You might regret it later in life.
Marty, don't be such a square.
Everybody who's anybody drinks.
Jeez, you smoke, too?
Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
We're going to take a little break, but we'll be back in a while, so don't nobody go nowhere.
Marty?
Why are you so nervous?
Lorraine.
Have you ever been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way, but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
You mean like how you're supposed to act on a first date?
Sort of.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You do?
You know what I do in those situations?
What?
I don't worry.
This is all wrong.
I don't know what it is.
But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing my brother.
I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.
Somebody's coming.
You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch.
And I'm going to take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.
Well, look-ey what we have here.
No, no! You're staying right here with me. Come on, Lorraine.
Let me go!
Leave her alone, you bastard!
Take him in back, all right? I'll be right there.
Just admit that you want it. Come on.
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.
Hey, let's put him in there.
Yeah!
That's for messing up my hair.
What the hell are you doing to my car?
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?
Hey, hey, listen, guys...
Look, I don't want to mess with no reefer addicts, okay?
Get home to your mama, boy.
Biff!
Hurry, Biff!
Let me out of here!
Reginald, where are your keys?
The keys are in the trunk.
Say that again?
I said, the keys are in here.
Come on!
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...
Oh.
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
George, help me!
Please!
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.
Please, George.
Are you deaf, McFly?
Close the door and beat it.
No, Biff.
You leave her alone.
All right, McFly.
You're asking for it, and now you're going to get it.
Biff, stop it!
Biff, you'll break his arm!
Biff, no!
Give me a hand here, Reginald.
Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!
Whose are these?
Mine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You're going to break his arm!
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Who is that guy?
That's George McFly.
That's George McFly?
Excuse me.
The storm.
Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.
He can't play with his hand like that, and we can't play without him.
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.
See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.
And if there's no music, they can't dance.
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.
If they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
Hey, man, the dance is over unless you know somebody else that can play the guitar.
This is for all you lovers out there.
Earth angel, Earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear
George, aren't you going to kiss me?
I don't know.
Scram, McFly.
I'm cutting in.
Earth angel, Earth angel
The one I adore
Hey, boy, you all right?
I can't play.
George!
George!
George.
Excuse me.
The vision of your happiness
Earth angel, Earth angel
Please be mine
My darling dear
Love you for all time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.
No. I got to go.
Come on, man. Let's do something that really cooks.
Something that cooks.
All right.
All right!
All right.
All right, this is an oldie, but...
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.
All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B.
Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?
Way down in Louisiana
Down in New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
He could play the guitar just like he's ringing a bell
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Hey, George, I heard you laid out Biff. Nice going.
George, you ever think of running for class president?
Johnny B. Goode
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
Chuck!
Chuck, it's Marvin.
Your cousin,
Marvin Berry.
You know that new sound you're looking for?
Well, listen to this.
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.
But your kids are going to love it.
Lorraine.
Marty, that was very interesting music.
Yeah.
I hope you don't mind, but George asked if he could take me home.
Great! Good.
Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.
I have a feeling, too.
Listen, I got to go, but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Marty, will we ever see you again?
I guarantee it.
Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice.
I'll never forget it.
Right, George.
Well, good luck, you guys.
Oh!
One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, go easy on him.
Okay.
Marty.
Such a nice name.
Damn!
Where is that kid?
Damn!
Damn! Damn!
You're late! Do you have no concept of time?
Hey, come on.
I had to change.
Do you think I'm going back in that zoot suit?
The old man really came through. It worked.
He laid out Biff in one punch.
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.
Never?
No. Why?
What's the matter?
All right! Let's set your destination time.
This is the exact time you left.
Let's send you back at exactly the same time.
It'll be like you never left.
Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there.
That's where you'll start from.
I've calculated the precise distance, taking into account the acceleration speed and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning strikes, which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.
When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.
Right.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Thanks.
Thank you.
See you in about 30 years.
I hope so.
Don't worry!
As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles an hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower everything will be fine.
Right.
What's the meaning of this?
You'll find out in 30 years.
It's about the future, isn't it?
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.
I warned you about this, kid.
The consequences could be disastrous!
Doc, that's a risk you're going to have to take.
Your life depends on it!
No!
I refuse to accept the responsibility.
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.
Great Scott!
You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Right! I got it!
Doc!
Come on, come on.
Let's go!
All right!
Take it up!
Go!
Doc!
What?
I have to tell you about the future.
What?
I have to tell you about the future!
What?
On the night I go back in time, you get...
Doc!
Go!
No, Doc!
Look at the time!
You've got less than four minutes. Please, hurry!
Yeah!
Damn it, Doc! Why did you have to tear up that letter?
If I only had more time.
Wait a minute.
I got all the time I want.
I got a time machine. I can just go back early and warn him.
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.
Engine running.
All right.
No. No, no.
Come on. Not this time.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.
Please. Please.
Come on!
Doc.
Crazy drunk driver.
Whoo!
All right. Fred.
You look great.
Everything looks great.
1:24. I still got time.
I'm coming, Doc!
No! No, not again!
Come on! Come on!
Libyans.
No!
You bastard!
Go!
Doc! Doc!
No! No!
You're alive.
Bulletproof vest?
How did you know?
I never got a chance to tell you.
What about all that talk about screwing up future events?
The space-time continuum?
Well, I figured, what the hell?
So, how far ahead are you going?
About 30 years.
It's a nice, round number.
Look me up when you get there, all right? Guess I'll be about 47.
I will.
Take care.
You, too.
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.
You bet.
What a nightmare.
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
Linda, first of all, I'm not your answering service, second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Well, which one was it,
Greg or Craig?
I don't know! I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
Breakfast.
Did you sleep in your clothes again last night?
Yeah. I...
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office.
You all right?
Yeah.
I think we need a rematch, George.
A rematch?
Why? Were you cheating?
No.
Hello.
Good morning.
Mom! Dad!
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.
Why, thank you, Marty.
George!
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning, Dave.
Linda.
Good morning, Mom.
Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
What? What, Ma?
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?
You've been planning it for two weeks.
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?
The car's wrecked.
Wrecked?
Wrecked?
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?
Quiet down.
I'm sure the car is fine.
Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
See? There's Biff out there waxing it right now.
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
Now, Biff, don't con me.
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.
I meant I was just starting on the second coat.
Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something.
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.
Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.
That's right.
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.
Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.
Honey!
Your first novel.
Like I've always told you, you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Keys?
How about a ride, mister?
Jennifer.
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes! Let me look at you.
Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
I haven't.
You okay?
Is everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
Everything is great.
Marty! You've got to come back with me!
Where?
Back to the future.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?
I need fuel.
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?
Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.
Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?
Do we become assholes or something?
No, no, no, no, Marty.
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.
Something has got to be done about your kids.
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.
Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
BAXTER: On November 1, 1959,
the population of New York City
was 8,042,783:
If you laid all these people end to end, 
figuring an average height
of five feet, six-and-a-half inches, 
they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan: 
I know facts like this
because I work for an insurance company, 
Consolidated Life of New York: 
We're one of the top five companies
in the country: 
Our home office has 31,259 employees, 
which is more than the entire population
of Natchez, Mississippi: 
I work on the nineteenth floor: 
Ordinary Policy Department, 
Premium Accounting Division, 
Section W, desk number 861:
My name is C: C: Baxter: 
"C" for Calvin, "C" for Clifford: 
However, most people call me Bud: 
I've been with Consolidated
for three years and 10 months, 
and my take-home pay is $94:70 a week: 
The hours in our department
are 8:50 to 5:20:
They're staggered by floor
so that 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees
without a serious traffic jam: 
As for myself, 
I very often stay on at the office
and work for an extra hour or two, 
especially when the weather is bad: 
It's not that I'm overly ambitious: 
It's just a way of killing time
until it's all right for me to go home: 
You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment: 
I live in the West sixties, 
just half a block from Central Park: 
My rent is $85 a month: 
It used to be $80 until last July, 
when Mrs: Lieberman, the landlady, 
put in a secondhand air-conditioning unit: 
It's a real nice apartment, nothing fancy, 
but kind of cozy, just right for a bachelor: 
The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to: 
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've got to get out of here.
Well, what's the panic?
I'm going to have another Martooni.
Oh, please, Sylvia, it's a quarter of 9:00.
Well, first you can't wait to get me here, and then it's rush, rush, rush!
Makes a person feel cheap.
Sweetie, it's not that, but I promised the guy
I'd be out of here by 8:00 positively.
What guy?
Whose apartment is this, anyway?
What's the difference?
Some schnook that works in the office.
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Some weather we're having.
- Yeah.
Must be from all that mishegaas at Cape Canaveral.
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Where do you live?
- I told you, with my mother.
- Well, where does she live?
- 179th Street in the Bronx.
All right, I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will. You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
- You mean you bring other girls up here?
- Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.
Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?
- No, I seem to have dropped my key.
Here it is.
Such a racket I heard in your place.
Maybe you had burglars?
Don't you worry about that.
There's nothing in there anybody'd want to steal.
Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy, but the little lady forgot her galoshes.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain, but you were supposed to be out of here by 8:00.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know, but those things don't always run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.
Well, I don't mind in the summer, but on a rainy night...
I haven't had any dinner yet.
Sure, sure.
Look, kid, I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake in personnel.
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.
We were discussing our department manpower-wise, promotion-wise.
I told him what a bright boy you are.
They're always on the lookout for young executives.
Thank you.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy, and you're also out of liquor.
Oh, I know. Yeah, Mr. Eichelberger,
Mortgage and Loan department, last night he had a little Halloween party here.
Lay in some vodka and some vermouth and put my name on it.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.
You still owe me for the last two bottles.
Yeah, I'll pay you on Friday.
Oh, and what ever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Cheese crackers.
Cheers.
Good evening, Baxter.
Hi, Doc. What, you have a late call?
Yeah, some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Good night, Doc.
Say, Baxter.
The way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Well, that's not me. I mean, it's just...
Once in a while,
I have a few people in for a drink.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron-man all around.
From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
Sometimes there's a twinight double-header.
- A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.
You know, Baxter,
I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center.
- I wonder if you could do us a favor.
- Me?
When you make out your will, and the way you're going, you should, would you mind leaving your body to the university?
My body?
I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.
Good night, Doc.
Slow down, kid!
For heaven...
From the world's greatest library
of film classics, 
we proudly present
Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, 
Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore
in Grand Hotel.
But first, a word from our sponsor: 
If you smoke the modern way, 
don't be fooled by phony filter claims: 
(GUNS FIRING)
(SHOUTING)
(BUGLE PLA YING)
And now Grand Hotel,
starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, 
Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore: 
But first, 
a word from our alternate sponsor: 
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures? 
- Hello?
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.
I'm in this bar on 61st Street, and I got to thinking about you, and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Well, that's very nice of you, but...
Who is this?
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch in Administration.
Oh, yeah, Mr. Dobisch.
I didn't recognize your voice.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.
Now, like I was saying,
I'm in this joint on 61st, and I think I got lucky.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.
I like to help you fellows out, but it's sort of late.
So why don't we make it some other time?
Listen, kid, I can't pass this up.
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.
I'm already in bed, and I've taken a sleeping pill, so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Look, Baxter, we're making out the monthly efficiency rating, and I'm putting you in the top 10.
Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Of course not, but how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's only 11:00, and I just want the place for 45 minutes.
I'm getting Ionely.
- Who are you talking to, anyway?
- My mother.
Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.
Ooh.
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?
I'm all out of liquor.
There's no clean glasses.
There's no cheese crackers. No nothing.
Let me worry about that.
Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch.
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch.
Be my guest!
We never close at Buddy-boy's.
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe."
- This the place?
- Yeah.
- How much?
- DRIVER: 70 cents.
Get the money, will you?
Watch those stingers!
- Give him a buck.
- DRIVER: Thanks, lady.
Put it back, honey.
Attagirl.
- Are you sure this is such a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.
I mean, barging in on your mother in the middle of the night.
Don't worry about the old lady.
One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Get the key, will you?
Not there. Under the mat.
- Under the mat?
- Yeah, come on, come on.
Open up, open up.
We haven't got all night.
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.
Mildred, he's at it again!
Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
How are you, Baxter?
They keeping you busy these days?
Yes, sir, they are indeed.
- Good morning, Mr. Kessel.
- Good morning, Miss Robinson.
Good morning, Mr. Williams.
Good morning, Miss Livingston.
Good morning, Mr. McKellway.
Good morning, Mrs. Schubert.
Good morning, Mr. Davidson.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- Good morning, Mr. Baxter.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
That's all. Take it away.
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.
What did you do to your hair?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it.
- You've got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.
I never catch colds.
Really? I was running some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims division.
Do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of 20 and 50 has two-and-a-half colds a year?
- Now, that makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?
To make the figures come out even, if I have no colds a year, some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Yeah. It's me.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Nineteen.
Watch your step, and watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby.
I beg your pardon?
One of these days I'm going to shut these doors on you, and...
Twenty next.
That Kubelik, boy, would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Yeah, she's the best operator in the building.
Yeah, well,
I'm a pretty good operator myself.
She just won't give me a tumble date-wise.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
A lot of guys around here have tried it.
All kinds of approaches. No dice.
What's she trying to prove?
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl.
There's millions of them.
Listen to him. Little Lord Fauntleroy: 
Hello, Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the nineteenth floor.
Oh, Buddy-boy.
I was just about to call you.
I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall.
You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum, so she started to do that mural.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.
But I did, didn't I?
I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there.
Oh, I found the key, all right, only it's the wrong key.
It is?
Well, how about that?
No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
And I couldn't get into my apartment!
So at 4:00 a.m.,
I got to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance.
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.
And about your promotion.
I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.
I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day's over.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
From Mr. Dobisch.
Wait.
For Mr. Dobisch.
Vanderhoff, Public Relations.
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.
All right, Miss Finch, type up what we got so far.
Look, Mr. Vanderhoff,
I've got you down here for tonight, but I'm going to be using the place myself, so I'll have to cancel.
Cancel? But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.
But I am sick.
I got a terrible cold and a fever, and I got to go to bed right after work.
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night there. Sweat it out.
That's the way you get pneumonia, and if I got pneumonia,
I'd be in bed for a month.
Okay, you made your point.
We'll just have to do it next Wednesday night.
That's the only night of the week I can get away.
Wednesday. Wednesday.
Wednesday. Wednesday.
I got somebody penciled in.
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.
Oh.
Mr. Eichelberger.
Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?
Wednesday is out.
Oh, that throws a little monkey wrench into my agenda.
Thursday? No, I'm all tied up on Thursday.
Let's schedule that meeting for Friday.
Friday.
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.
"Premium-wise and billing-wise,
"we are 18% ahead of last year,
October-wise."
Hello?
Yeah, Baxter, what's up?
Instead of Friday, could you possibly switch to Thursday?
You'd be doing me a great favor.
Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.
Sylvia, it's for you.
Yeah?
Oh, hello.
Sure, I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.
Look, Sylvia, instead of Friday, could we make it Thursday night?
Thursday.
Well, that's The Untouchables with Bob Stack.
Bob who?
All right, so we'll watch it at the apartment.
Big deal.
Hello, Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Mr. Eichelberger, it's okay for Friday.
Mr. Vanderhoff, okay for Wednesday.
All right, I'll tell him.
Hey, Baxter. That was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last 20 minutes.
They want you upstairs.
Hey, what gives, Baxter?
You getting promoted or getting fired?
Would you care to make a small wager?
Well, I've been here twice as long as you have, and they never...
Like say, $1.00?
It's a bet!
- Going up?
- Oh, excuse me.
Hi, 27, please, and drive carefully.
You're carrying precious cargo.
I mean, manpower-wise.
Twenty-seven.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I am in the top 10 efficiency-wise, and this may be the day promotion-wise.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Why not, now that they're kicking me upstairs?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
- Really?
- The characters you meet.
Something happens to men in elevators.
Must be the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head or something.
- Boy, I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear them.
Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime or some evening after work.
- Twenty-seven.
- Oh.
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.
Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this, what with a cold and every...
How do I look?
Fine. Wait.
Thank you.
You know, that's the first thing
I ever noticed about you when you were still on the local elevator you always wore a flower.
Good luck, and wipe your nose.
C.C. Baxter,
Ordinary Premium Accounting.
- Mr. Sheldrake called me.
- I called you.
That is, I tried to call you for 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry. I...
- Go on in.
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.
Come in. Come in.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like, Baxter.
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Been hearing some nice things about you.
Have a report here from Mr. Dobisch.
Says you're Ioyal, cooperative, resourceful...
Mr. Dobisch said that?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week, you work late at the office without overtime.
You know how it is. Things pile up.
Mr. Vanderhoff in Public Relations and Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans.
They both would like to have you transferred to their departments.
Very flattering.
Tell me, Baxter, just what is it that makes you so popular?
I don't know.
Think.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid.
I know everything that goes on in this building, in every department, on every floor, every day of the year.
You do?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler.
He was very popular, too.
It turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial department, tying up our switchboards, using our IBM Machines to figure the odds.
So the day before the Kentucky Derby,
I called in the vice squad, and we raided the thirteenth floor.
- The vice squad?
- That's right.
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.
Just what kind of a joint are you running?
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around this office from Kirkeby to Vanderhoff to Eichelberger to Dobisch.
It's the key to a certain apartment, and do you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative C.C. Baxter.
Oh.
Are you going to deny it?
No.
I'm not going to deny...
If you just let me explain.
You'd better.
Well.
About a year ago,
I was going to night school.
I was taking this course in advanced accounting.
One of the guys in our department, lives in Jersey, had to go to a banquet at the Biltmore.
His wife was meeting him in town.
He needed someplace to change into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key, and word must have gotten out because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys are suddenly going to banquets.
You give a key to one guy, you can't say no to another.
The whole thing got out of hand, and...
Pardon me.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust.
Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming...
How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Just those four.
Out of a total of 31,259, so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel, percentage-wise.
That's not the point, Baxter.
Four rotten apples in a barrel, no matter how large the barrel...
Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
It won't!
Believe me, never again.
Nobody is going to use my apartment from now on.
- Where is your apartment, Baxter?
- West 67th Street.
You have no idea what I've been going through with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key and...
How do you work it with the key?
I usually slip it to them in the office, and they leave it under a mat.
Never again. I can promise you that.
Yes, Miss Olsen.
Mrs. Sheldrake returning your call on 2.
Yes, dear: I called you earlier: 
Where were you? 
Oh, you had to take Tommy to the dentist, huh?
No cavities. Good. Hold it, dear.
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't want to intrude.
(STAMMERING) I thought since everything was straightened out...
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is I won't be home for dinner tonight.
The branch manager from Kansas City is in town.
I'm taking him to the theater.
Music Man:  What else?
No, don't wait up for me, darling.
Goodbye.
Tell me, Baxter, have you seen Music Man? 
Hmm?
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.
How would you like to go tonight?
What, you and me?
I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City.
No. I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.
Well, that's very kind of you, but I'm not feeling well.
I've got this cold.
I'm going to go right home.
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.
So do I.
I'm going to take four aspirin, get into bed, so you might as well give the tickets to somebody else.
Look, Baxter,
I'm not just giving these tickets.
I want to swap them.
Swap them? For what?
It also says here that you are alert, astute and quite imaginative.
Oh?
Oh...
(WHISPERING) This?
That's good thinking, Baxter.
There's going to be a shift in personnel around here next month.
As far as I'm concerned, you are executive material.
I am?
Now, put down the key.
And put down the address.
It's on the second floor.
There's no name over the door.
It just says Apartment 2-A.
It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.
- Yes, thank you, sir.
You will be careful with the record player?
Oh, and about the liquor,
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.
Now, remember, Baxter, this is going to be our little secret.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- You know how people talk.
You don't have to worry about that.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Certainly not.
I mean, it's none of my business.
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference, percentage-wise?
- Here you are, Baxter.
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a nice time.
- You, too, sir.
So I figure a man in his position, he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.
Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven and some schnook's apartment.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh! Miss Kubelik?
I've been waiting for you.
- You have?
- I almost didn't recognize you.
This is the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
How did everything go on the twenty-seventh floor?
Great. Look, have you seen
The Music Man? 
No.
- Would you like to?
- Sure.
I thought maybe we'd get a bite to eat first, and then we'd go.
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.
- You mean, like a girlfriend?
- No, like a man.
I wasn't trying to be personal.
It's just the fellas in the office, they were wondering about, you know, if you ever...
You tell them now and then.
This date, is it just a date, or is it something serious?
Well, it used to be serious, at least I was, but he wasn't.
So now the whole thing's more or less kaput.
- In that case, couldn't you...
- No, I'm afraid not.
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.
I... I understand.
Well, it was just an idea.
I'd hate to see a theater ticket go to waste.
- What time does the show go on?
Well, I could meet you at the theater, if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful.
It's Majestic on 44th Street.
I'll meet you in the lobby, okay?
Yeah. You know,
I felt so lousy this morning.
Had a 101 fever.
Now, along comes my promotion and us.
Eleventh row, center.
And you said I should have stayed in bed.
- How is your cold?
- What cold?
After the show, we could go out on the town.
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.
There's a great little band at El Chico in the Village, practically around the corner from where you live.
Sounds good.
How do you know where I live?
Oh, I even know who you live with.
Your sister and brother-in-law.
And I know when you were born and where.
- I know all sorts of things about you.
- How come?
A couple of months ago,
I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I know your height and your weight and your Social Security number.
You had mumps and measles, and you had your appendix out.
Don't mention the appendix to the fellas in the office, okay?
I wouldn't want them to get the wrong idea about how you found out. Bye.
Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
Please, Fran, not so loud.
Still afraid someone might see us together?
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.
- How long has it been, Fran, a month?
- Six weeks.
But who's counting?
I missed you.
Like old times.
Same booth, same song.
It's been hell.
Same sauce, sweet and sour.
You don't know what it's like standing next to you in that elevator day after day.
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff, please.
I'm just beginning to get over it.
I don't believe you.
Look, Jeff, we had two wonderful months this summer, but that was it.
Happens all the time.
Wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with his secretary or the manicurist or the elevator girl.
Come September, the picnic's over.
Goodbye.
The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl...
They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man.
Then one day he keeps looking at his watch and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes out to catch the 7:14 to White Plains.
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee, and you sit there by yourself, and you think.
And it all begins to look so ugly.
How do you think I felt riding home on that 7:14 train?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?
I want you back, Fran.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I asked you to meet me because I have something to tell you.
- Go ahead, tell me.
- Not here.
- Can't we go someplace else?
- No. I have a date at 8:30.
Important?
Not very, but I'm going to be there anyway.
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?
Fran, do you remember that last weekend we had?
Do I? That leaky little boat you rented and me in a black negligee and a life preserver.
- You remember what we talked about?
- We talked about a lot of things.
I mean, about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it on a long-playing record now,
Music to String Her Along By: 
"My wife doesn't understand me.
We haven't gotten along for years.
"You're the best thing that ever happened to me."
That's enough, Fran.
"Just trust me, baby.
We'll work it out somehow."
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
Fran, if you'll just listen to me for a minute.
All right, I'm sorry.
I saw my lawyer this morning.
I wanted his advice about the best way to handle it.
- Handle what?
- What do you think?
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.
Of course not.
You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure.
If you'll just tell me that you still love me.
You know I do.
Oh, Fran.
Jeff, darling.
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.
Taxi.
- Jeff, please, I have that date, remember?
- And I love you, remember?
Where are we going?
Not back to that leaky boat.
I promise.
51, West 67th.
Congratulations.
Would you mind?
C.C. Baxter. That's me.
Thank you.
KIRKEBY: Hi, Buddy-boy.
DOBISCH: Congratulations and all that jazz.
Hi, fellas.
Well, you made it, just like we promised.
Quite an office. Name on the door, rug on the floor, the whole schmear.
Teamwork. That's what counts in an organization like this.
All for one and one for all, know what I mean?
Yeah, I have a vague idea.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you, gratitude-wise.
I'm very grateful.
EICHELBERGER: Then why are you locking us out all of a sudden?
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few weeks, what with my cold and like that.
We went to bat for you, and now you won't play ball with us.
Well, after all, it's my apartment.
It's private property.
It's not a public playground.
VANDERHOFF: All right, so you got yourself a girl.
That's okay with us, but not every night in the week.
How selfish can you get?
Last week,
I had to borrow my nephew's car and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.
I'm too old for that sort of thing.
I mean, in a Volkswagen.
I sympathize with your problem.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Are you threatening me?
Listen, Baxter, we made you, and we can break you.
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Everything satisfactory, Baxter?
Do you like your office?
Yes, sir, and I want to thank you very much.
Don't thank me. Thank your friends here.
They're the ones who recommended you.
We just dropped by to wish him the best of luck.
So long, Baxter.
We know you won't let us down.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open to my office.
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.
How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.
- Sit down.
I want you to know I'll work hard to justify your confidence in me.
I'm sure you will.
So, Baxter, about the apartment, now that you've got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
- Well, I guess so.
- You know my secretary Miss Olsen.
Oh, yeah, very attractive.
Is she the lucky girl that...
Oh, no, no, no. I just meant that she's...
She's kind of a busybody, always sticking her nose in everything, and passing that key back and forth, why take chances?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
- I have something I think belongs to you.
- Me?
I mean, the young lady, whoever she may be.
It was on my couch when I got back last night.
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?
Well, you know how it is. Sooner or later, they always give you a bad time.
Yeah, I know how it is.
You see a girl a couple times a week, just for laughs, and right away they think you're going to divorce your wife.
Now, I ask you, is that fair?
No, sir, it's very unfair.
Especially to your wife.
Yeah.
You know, Baxter, I envy you.
Bachelor, all the dames you want, no headaches, no complications.
Yes, sir, that's the life, all right.
Oh, put me down for Thursday again.
Roger, and I'll get that other key.
SYLVIA: Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.
Consolidated Life. Merry Christmas.
I'm ringing.
Yeah? Yeah!
Where? You bet!
Somebody watch my line!
There's a swinging party on the nineteenth floor!
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
ALL: Hey!
So I said to him, "Never again.
"Either you get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."
Miss Kubelik! Miss...
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.
I thought you were avoiding me.
What gave you that idea?
In the last six weeks, you've only been in my elevator once, and you didn't take off your hat.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt that night you stood me up.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't suddenly walk out on him because you're having another date with another man.
You did the only decent thing.
I wouldn't be too sure.
Just because I wear a uniform, that doesn't make me a girl scout.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a Second Administrative Assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character, and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.
I mean, decency-wise and otherwise-wise.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- One more.
- Oh, I shouldn't drink while I'm driving.
You're so right.
By the power vested in me,
I herewith declare this elevator out of order.
Shall we join the natives?
Why not? They seem friendly enough.
Don't you believe it.
After a while, there will be human sacrifices.
White-collar workers tossed into the computing machines and punched full of those little square holes.
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three.
I thought so.
Wait a minute.
I think I hear the sound of running water.
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen, Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
- Yes, I know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me.
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding-ding.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
And just before me, there was Miss Rossi in Auditing, and after me, there was Miss Koch in Disability, and right before you was a Miss...
What's-her-name on the twenty-fifth floor.
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.
It's him. Oh, what a salesman.
Always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant and the same pitch about divorcing his wife.
And in the end, you wind up with Egg Foo Yung on your face.
Miss Kubelik.
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.
Always happy to do a little something for our girls in uniform.
Are you all right? What's the matter?
Nothing. There are just too many people here.
Why don't we step into my office?
There's something
I want your opinion about, anyhow.
I have my own office now, actually.
You may be interested to know that I am the second-youngest executive in this company.
The only one younger is the grandson of the Chairman of the Board.
Do you mind?
Miss Kubelik,
I would like your honest opinion.
I've had this under my desk for a week.
It cost me $15.
Haven't been able to get up enough nerve to wear it.
It's what they call the Junior Executive model.
What do you think?
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
I like it.
Really? You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Of course not.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to one side.
How's that? Is that better?
Much better.
Well, since you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me, how about the three of us going out tonight?
You, me and the bowler.
We'll stroll down Fifth Avenue, sort of break it in.
This is a bad day for me.
Oh, I understand.
Christmas, family and all that.
I'd better get back to my elevator.
I don't want to be fired.
You don't have to worry about that.
I got quite a bit of influence in personnel.
You know Mr. Sheldrake?
- Why?
- Well, he and I are like that.
He sent me a Christmas card, see?
Makes a cute picture.
I thought maybe I'd put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake, get you a little promotion.
How would you like to be an elevator starter?
I'm afraid there are too many girls around here with seniority over me.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays?
I could call you and pick you up.
We'd have a big unveiling.
Are you sure this is the right way to wear this?
I think so. Here.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much?
I mean, after all, this is a conservative firm.
I don't want people to think
I'm an entertainer.
What's the matter?
Well, uh...
The mirror, it's broken.
Yes, I know. I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.
Your phone.
Yes.
Just a minute.
If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
Have a nice Christmas.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up, and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.
Yes, sir, same to you.
Hey! Where you going, Buddy-boy?
The party's just starting.
Say, listen, kid, give me a break, will you?
How about tomorrow afternoon?
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car doesn't even have a heater.
4:00, okay?
Hey, Charlie, give me a shot of bourbon and step on it!
My sleigh is double-parked.
If you buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.
Rum Collins.
Rum Collins and another one of these little mothers.
(JUKEBOX PLAYING
O COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL)
You like Castro?
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?
What is Castro?
You know, that big shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
What about him?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no-good fink.
Two weeks ago, I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.
That so?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Who's Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana in jail.
Got mixed up in that revolution?
Mickey would do nothing like that.
He's a jockey.
They caught him doping a horse.
Well, you can't win them all.
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring.
Nothing.
No action.
Dullsville.
- You married?
- No.
- Family?
- No.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
I said I had no family.
I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.
You're just going to sit there and keep bawling?
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?
Look, I know you think
I've been stalling you, but when you've been married to a woman for 12 years, you just don't sit down at the breakfast table and say, "Pass the sugar.
I want a divorce."
It's not that easy.
Anyway, this is the wrong time.
The kids are home from school.
My in-laws are visiting for the holidays.
I can't bring it up now.
This isn't like you, Fran.
You were always such a good sport, such fun to be with.
That's me.
The happy idiot, a million laughs.
That's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.
A funny thing happened to me at the office party today.
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.
You know, ring-a-ding-ding?
I laughed so much, I like to have died.
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen?
That's ancient history.
Well, I never was very good at history.
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi.
No, no. She came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.
Now, Fran...
And just think, right now some lucky girl in the building is going to come after me.
Okay, okay, Fran.
I guess I deserve that, but ask yourself, why does a man run around with a lot of girls?
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's Ionely, that's why.
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would have learned by now.
When you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?
Merry Christmas.
What is it?
Oh.
Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.
Thanks, Fran.
We better keep it here.
Yeah, we better.
Oh, I have a present for you.
I didn't quite know what to get you.
Besides, it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so here's $100.
You go and buy yourself something.
They have some nice alligator bags at Bergdorf's.
Look, Fran, I didn't realize it was so late.
It's quarter to 7:00.
I mustn't miss my train.
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.
Okay. I just thought as long as it was paid for.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.
Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
$100? I don't call that cheap.
And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment.
Stop it, Fran.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Yeah.
Are you coming?
No. You run along. I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights.
I'll see you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday, and Monday again and Thursday again.
It won't always be like this, Fran.
I love you.
Careful. Lipstick.
Merry Christmas.
Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
But it's early, Charlie.
Don't you know what night this is?
I know, Charlie. I know.
I work for the outfit.
Hey, knock it off, will you? Go home.
O-U-T. Out.
Where will we go, my place or yours?
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.
Poor Mickey. When I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana...
- Would you like to see his picture?
- Not particularly.
He's so cute. He's 5'2", 99 pounds, like a little Chihuahua.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.
You got a girlfriend?
She may be a girl, but she's no friend of mine.
Still stuck on her, huh?
Stuck on her?
Obviously, you do not know me very well.
I don't know you at all.
Permit me. C.C. Baxter, Junior Executive,
Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
I'm Mrs. MacDougall, Margie to you.
Yeah. This way, Mrs. MacDougall.
Say, this is snuggsville.
Mrs. MacDougall,
I think it's only fair to warn you, you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
- No kidding?
- Ask anybody around here.
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go, and I may go just like that,
I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Sort of gives you goosebumps just to think about it.
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen, and let's not waste any more time, preliminary-wise.
I'm with you, lover.
(RECORD PLAYER NEEDLE
SCRATCHING)
I don't own this.
All right, Miss Kubelik, get up.
Come on. It's past checking-out time.
The management would appreciate it if you'd get the hell out of here.
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot, but it's all over between us, so beat it.
O-U-T, out.
Come on, wake up.
Oh, my God.
Miss Kubelik?
Miss Kubelik?
I broke a nail trying to get the tray out.
You ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator.
I didn't mean right now.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Doc!
Doc, there's a girl in my place who took some sleeping pills.
You better come quick.
I can't wake her up. I can't...
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up.
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?
You're going to wear yourself out.
- Not so rough, honey.
- Good night.
- Good night?
- Party's over.
What's the matter?
Did I do something wrong?
No. It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.
Not this one. In there, Doc.
- What's going on here, anyway?
- Nothing. Will you please just get out?
My shoes. Some lover you are.
Some sexpot!
Here. Find a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
You bet I will, and when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in, you fink!
Is she going to be all right, Doc?
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half full, about a dozen or so.
Are you going to have to take her to the hospital?
Help me, will you? Into the bathroom.
What are you going to do?
Get that stuff out of her stomach, if it isn't too late.
You better put some coffee on, and pray.
Bring my bag.
Roll up her right sleeve.
Hold that.
Nice veins.
You want to tell me what happened?
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.
You see, we had some words earlier.
It was nothing serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie.
Yes, you are.
If you'd come home half an hour later, you'd have had quite a Christmas present.
DREYFUSS: Get the coffee.
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.
What's her name?
Miss Kubelik.
Fran.
Fran, I'm a doctor.
I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.
You took all those sleeping pills, remember?
Sleeping pills.
That's right, Fran, and I'm a doctor.
Doctor...
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Now, tell me again. What's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took... I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are?
No.
Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
Do you know who that is?
Look at him.
Mr. Baxter, nineteenth floor.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Mister? Miss? Such politeness.
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.
What are you doing here?
Don't you remember?
We were together at the office party.
Oh, yes. The office party.
Miss Olsen.
That's right. I told you we had a fight.
That was what it's about. Miss Olsen.
You know, that girl that was here earlier.
I don't understand.
Well, it's not important.
The main thing is I got here in time.
You're going to be all right. Isn't she, Doc?
I'm so tired.
Come on. Drink this.
Please. Just let me sleep.
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes.
Let's get her walking.
We got to keep her awake for the next few hours.
Now, come on, Fran. Walk. Walk!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Left, right, left, right, left, right, and return and one, two, three, four.
Now you got it. One, two, three, four.
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four.
One, two, and return again.
And left, right, left, right.
She'll sleep on and off for the next 24 hours.
Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up.
Just as long as she's okay.
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient.
I ought to charge you by the mile.
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.
How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik. Two "K's."
What's her address?
Where does she live?
Why do you want to know, Doc?
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.
But she didn't mean it, Doc.
It was an accident.
She had a little too much to drink.
She didn't know what she was doing.
There was no suicide note or anything.
Believe me, Doc,
I'm not thinking about myself.
Aren't you?
It's just she's got a family, and there's the people at the office.
Look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor?
Let's just say you're here as a neighbor.
Well, as a doctor,
I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.
But as your neighbor,
I'd like to kick your keister clear around the block.
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there, and don't tell me, but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on.
Live now, pay later. Diners Club.
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch:  You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.
- A mensch,  a human being.
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.
(CHUCKLING) Wasn't I?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter, because most of them try it again.
Well, you know where I am if you need me.
Mr. Baxter, open up already.
Oh.
Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was?
Kriss Kringle?
What was going on here last night?
- Last night?
- All that marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp.
You were having army maneuvers, maybe?
I'll never invite those people again.
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep 10 minutes, and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss.
I happen to know he was out on a case.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter.
This is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.
Come on, Oscar.
Operator, I want White Plains, New York,
Mr. J.D. Sheldrake.
Make that person-to-person.
Five, four, three, two, one, let her rip!
I'll get the phone.
Dad, why don't we put a fly in the nose cone, see if we can bring it back alive?
Hey, that's a thought.
Maybe we should put in two flies and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
See if they'll what?
Propagate. You know, multiply.
- Baby flies?
- Oh.
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.
A Mr. Baxter.
- Baxter?
- Person-to-person.
Come on. Help me round up some flies.
Hello. Yes. What's on your mind, Baxter?
I hate to disturb you, but something came up.
It's rather important.
I think it would be a good idea if you could see me at the apartment as soon as possible.
You're not making sense, Baxter.
What's this all about?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone, but a certain party, you know who I mean,
I found her here last night.
She'd taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
What?
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.
I don't know why they bother me with these things on Christmas day.
Yes, Baxter.
Just how serious is it?
It was touch and go there for a while, but she's sleeping it off now.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
That's impossible. I...
You'll have to handle this situation yourself, Baxter.
As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir. I understand. She left a letter.
Would you like me to open it and read it to you?
It was just a suggestion.
No, you don't have to worry about that.
I kept your name out of it, so there will be no trouble police-wise or newspaper-wise.
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine, so we were very lucky in that respect.
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.
No. He just jumped to the conclusion.
Around here,
I'm known as quite a ladies' man.
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.
It looks like it'll be a couple of days before she's fully recovered.
And I may have a little problem with the landlady.
All right, Mr. Sheldrake, I'll keep her in the apartment as long as I can.
Isn't there some sort of message you want me to give her?
Well, I'll think of something.
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik, what are you doing out of bed?
I didn't know.
I had no idea this was your apartment.
Here. Let me help you.
I'm so ashamed.
Why didn't you just let me die?
What kind of talk is that?
You got a little overemotional.
You're fine now.
Oh.
Oh, my head.
It feels just like a big wad of chewing gum.
- What time is it?
My dress. I have to go home.
You're in no shape to go anywhere but back to bed.
- You don't want me here.
- Sure, I do.
It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
I'm stronger than you are, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want to brush my teeth.
- Oh.
Of course. I think I can find a new toothbrush somewhere.
Here. Put that on.
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.
Back in a minute.
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
I wonder if I could borrow some coffee, and maybe an orange, and a couple of eggs.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges!
What you need is a good horsewhipping.
- Ma'am?
- From me, the doctor has no secrets.
Poor girl.
How could you do a thing like that?
Please. I didn't do anything, honest.
It's just... I mean...
You take a girl out a couple of times just for laughs, and right away, she thinks you're getting serious marriage-wise.
Big shot. For you, I wouldn't lift a finger.
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
My sister.
She'll want to know what happened to me.
Wait a minute!
Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you going to tell her?
I haven't figured it out exactly.
Well, you better figure it out exactly.
Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
- Who?
- Someone from the office.
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.
- What's her first name?
- Miss.
- When are you coming home?
- As soon as I can walk.
- Something's wrong with your legs?
- No, my stomach.
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out.
Miss Kubelik,
I don't think you ought to call anybody, not till you get the chewing gum out of your head.
They'll be worried about me.
My brother-in-law might be calling the police.
That's why we have to be careful.
We don't want to involve anybody.
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.
Thanks for reminding me.
I didn't mean it that way.
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
You're wrong. He told me...
He's a liar, and that's not the worst part.
The worst part is, I still love him.
Oh, that must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.
You remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.
So where's the victim?
Max the knife.
-Nu,  little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.
Here. The best thing for dizzy is a little noodle soup with chicken, white meat and a glass tea.
No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
Go ahead. Eat. Enjoy.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
- Well, I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.
Go to my kitchen, third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
So, what are you waiting for, a singing commercial?
I can't eat.
You must eat, and you must get healthy, and you must forget him.
Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here.
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.
Turns out he's King Farouk with the drinking, with the cha-cha, with the no napkins.
A girl like you, for the rest of your life, you want to cry in your noodle soup?
Who needs it? You listen to me.
You find yourself a nice, substantial man, a widower maybe, and settle down instead of noshing all those sleeping pills.
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?
One napkin, coming up.
I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
What did I tell you?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.
I'll wash the dishes.
You wash them, you break them.
I'll come back for them later.
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered that anybody'd think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me.
Did you find something here?
An envelope?
Yes. I've got it.
Don't you think we'd better destroy it so it won't fall in the wrong hands?
Open it.
- There's nothing here but a $100 bill.
- That's right.
- Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
- Sure.
Take this away, will you?
Would you like me to move the television set in here?
Do you play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.
- I am. Let me get the cards.
You don't have to entertain me,
Mr. Baxter.
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know, togetherness.
Guess what I did last Christmas?
Had an early dinner at the automat, went to the zoo, and then I came home and cleaned up after Mr. Eichelberger.
He had a little eggnog party here.
So I'm way ahead this year.
Three across. Spades double. High deals.
Six. Eight.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I know what you mean.
Nine, ten...
Queen.
I don't want it.
Pick a card.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
A bad insurance risk?
That's me with men.
I was jinxed from the word go.
First time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Cemetery?
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.
His name was George, and he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Gin.
That's 10, 20, 36 and 25, makes 61 and two boxes.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.
How many guys were there?
Three.
The last one was the manager of a finance company back home in Pittsburgh.
They found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.
Cut.
I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband.
He drives a cab.
They sent me to secretarial school, and then I applied for a job at Consolidated, but I flunked the typing test.
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.
I just can't spell.
So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator, and that's how I met Jeff.
Oh, God, I'm so fouled-up.
What am I going to do now?
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.
Was he very upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah. Very.
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You what?
As one woman to another,
I'm sure she'll understand.
I don't think that's a very good idea,
Miss Kubelik.
Why not?
For one thing, you can't spell.
Secondly, if you did something like that, you'd hate yourself.
I don't like myself very much, anyway.
Pick up the cards and let's go.
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.
- You really want to discard that?
- Sure.
Gin.
Let's see. That's 20, 40, 52 and 25, 77.
Spades are double. 154 and...
Blitzed, two games.
All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?
What do I want? Just a minute.
You can't come in here!
What's the matter with you, Buddy-boy?
I made a reservation for 4:00, remember?
You can't stay here, so take your champagne and go.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you, but I told the little lady it was set.
Do you want to make a liar out of me?
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?
You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Now will you get out?
Hey, come on. What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?
Mildred.
What's holding things up?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party, the four of us?
No.
Well, I don't blame you.
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean, Kubelik-wise.
Now don't worry,
I won't say a word to anybody.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.
Who was that?
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne.
Would you like some?
Would you mind opening that window?
Now don't go getting any ideas,
Miss Kubelik.
I just want some fresh air.
It's only one story down.
The best you could do is break a leg.
So they'll shoot me like a horse.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
- Who'd care?
- I would!
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice, like you?
Yeah. Well, that's just the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.
Go to sleep.
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
Miss Olsen, will you come into my office, please?
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help.
Me?
Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeff.
You know, I never could hold my liquor.
Well, I thought you could hold your tongue.
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.
I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay.
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff, only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake.
I'd like Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.
That's C.C. Baxter, and he's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.
BAXTER: Hello? 
SHELDRAKE: Hello, Baxter: 
Jeff Sheldrake: Can you talk? 
Yes. She's in the shower.
She's coming along fine, considering.
Good. Is there anything you need? Money?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.
As a matter of fact,
I have some money for you. $100.
Oh.
Well, if there's anything I can do for you...
For me? I don't think so.
But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her.
Like what?
Put yourself in my place, Baxter.
How can I help her? My hands are tied.
Well, at least you can talk to her.
Now, let me put her on.
And please, be gentle.
There's a call for you!
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't want to talk to him.
I think you should.
I got to run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left around here but one frozen pizza.
I'll be right back, okay?
Hello, Jeff.
Yes, I'm all right.
Why did you do it, Fran?
It's so childish, and it never solves anything.
I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me that way.
But let's forget the whole thing.
Pretend it never happened.
What do you say, Fran?
Fran?
Are you there, Fran? 
Of course I'm not here.
Because the whole thing never happened.
I never took those pills. I never loved you.
We never even met.
Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
There you go again.
You know I didn't mean it that way, Fran.
You just get well.
Do what the nurse tells you.
I mean Baxter.
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake? This is Miss Olsen.
Fine, thank you.
Mrs. Sheldrake, I was wondering if we could have lunch together.
Well, I don't know how important it is, but I think you might find it educational.
It concerns your husband.
All right. 1:00,
Longchamp's, Madison and 59th.
Don't worry. I'm on my way.
Just making a personal call.
Here's a dime.
Going down.
Oh, Mr. Baxter, I'm glad you're here.
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Gas?
Miss Kubelik!
Miss Kubelik!
- You all right?
- Sure.
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
You turned it on, but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?
- In this house, you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?
Well, I was washing my stockings, so I thought I might as well wash your socks, too.
Thank you.
It's very curious.
I could only find three-and-a-half pair.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I'd say.
What's a tennis racket doing in the kitchen?
Tennis racket?
Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.
I used it to strain the spaghetti.
Why not?
As a matter of fact,
I'm a pretty good cook, only, I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Yes, you are.
When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found?
Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no.
I don't mean to girls. I mean...
You mean, to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I know so.
He's a taker.
A what?
Some people take, some people get took, and they know they're getting took, and there's nothing they can do about it.
I wouldn't say that.
What would you like to have for dinner?
Hey. Onion soup and canned asparagus...
I really should be getting home.
My family will be flipping by now.
You can't leave yet.
The doctor said it takes 48 hours to get that stuff out of your system.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system.
If only they'd invent some kind of pump for that.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.
You think it's the end of the world, but it's not.
I went through exactly the same thing myself.
- You did?
- Well, maybe not exactly the same.
I tried to do it with a gun.
- Over a girl?
- Worse than that.
It was the wife of my best friend, and I was mad about her.
But I knew it was hopeless, and I decided to end it all.
I went to a pawnshop and bought a.45 automatic, and I drove up to Eden Park...
- You know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.
Well, anyway, I parked the car and loaded that gun.
You read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves?
Believe me, it's not that easy.
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?
You know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?
- Here.
In the knee?
Yeah. While I was sitting there trying to make up my mind, a cop stuck his head in the car because I was illegally parked and I tried to hide the gun under the seat, and it went off.
That's terrible.
It was a year before I could bend the knee, but I got over the girl in three weeks.
She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids and gained 20 pounds.
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.
Are you just making this up to make me feel better?
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.
- Do you want to see my knee?
- No, thank you.
The fellas in the office might get the wrong idea how I found out.
Let them.
Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us tonight and you have the fruitcake for dessert.
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.
Yes, nurse.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for one of the elevator girls,
Miss Kubelik.
So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't?
- No.
Where can I get some information?
Who's in charge here?
Well, that comes under
General Office Administration.
See Mr. Dobisch, twenty-first floor.
Thanks.
So yesterday afternoon,
I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom.
- Who?
- Kubelik.
No kidding? Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot.
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of them showed up for work today.
AWOL?
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah?
My name is Karl Matuschka.
My sister-in-law, she runs one of the elevators here.
- Fran Kubelik.
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?
- Of course.
There may be a lot of employees here, but we're one big, happy family.
Well, she lives with us and my wife is getting pretty nervous on account of Fran hasn't been home for the past two days.
That so?
Anyway, we was wondering if somebody in the office knew what happened to her.
I see.
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?
Why not?
We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Who is Buddy-boy?
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racket.
You should see my backhand.
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must! Gracious living-wise.
Meatball
Meatball
- I see you bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.
You know,
I used to live like Robinson Crusoe.
I mean, shipwrecked among eight million people and then one day,
I saw a footprint in the sand, and there you were.
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.
- You usually eat alone?
- Oh, no.
Sometimes, I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes Dinah Shore or Perry Como.
The other night,
I had dinner with Mae West.
Of course, she was much younger then. Cheers.
Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.
- Oh, I don't?
- We're going to finish the gin game.
- Oh.
- So keep a clear head.
I don't want to take advantage of you, the way I did yesterday in bed.
- Baxter?
- Yes.
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Okay, get your clothes and I got the cab downstairs.
Wait a minute,
I know what you're thinking, but it isn't as bad as it...
It's none of my business what you do, Fran.
You're over 21. But your sister happens to think you're a lady.
All we were going to do is just eat and wash the dishes.
Look, Buddy-boy, if there wasn't a lady present,
- I'd clobber you.
- All right, Karl!
I'll get dressed.
Want a martini?
How about some spaghetti with meat sauce that I cooked myself?
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.
It must be murder driving a cab in New York.
I mean, with the cross-town traffic.
- Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?
- Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you. Miss Kubelik.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Doc, this is Mr. Matuschka, and he's...
- He's got a cab downstairs.
- Fran been sick or something?
No. Just a little accident.
What does he mean, accident?
Well, these things happen all the time.
What things?
Say, what kind of doctor are you, anyway?
Not that kind of doctor.
He just gave her a shot and pumped out her stomach.
- What for?
- Because I took some sleeping pills, but I'm all right now, so let's go.
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.
You?
Who else?
Leave him alone!
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.
MATUSCHKA: Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Well, I don't want to gloat, but just between us, you had it coming to you.
You're going to have a shiner tomorrow.
Let me get my bag.
Don't bother, Doc.
It doesn't hurt a bit.
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.
Would you please tell Mr. Sheldrake
I'd like to come up and see him?
It's rather important.
Will you call me back, please?
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.
All your troubles are over.
I'm going to take Miss Kubelik off your hands.
The plain fact is, I love her.
I haven't told her yet. I thought that you should be the first to know.
After all, you don't really want her, and I do, and although it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me.
So I think it would be the best thing all around, solution-wise.
Yes?
I'll be right up.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.
All your troubles are over.
Nineteen.
Hiya, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Hit by a swinging door?
Or maybe a yellow cab?
That guy really must have belted him.
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.
Twenty-seven.
You see, Mr. Sheldrake, those two days she spent in the apartment have made me realize how Ionely I'd been before.
Thanks to you,
I'm in a financial position to marry her.
If I can ever square things with her family.
Good morning. C.C. Baxter.
-WOMAN: Mr: Baxter is here: 
- Send him in.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.
I've got good news for you, Baxter.
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik.
Well, stop worrying.
I'm going to take her off your hands.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right, Baxter.
I've moved out of the house.
I'm going to be staying in town at the athletic club.
You left your wife?
If you must know, I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me.
- Ain't that a kick in the head?
- Yeah.
Now, what's your news, Baxter?
It's about Miss Kubelik.
She's feeling all right again so she went back home.
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.
This way, Baxter.
Sit down. Try it on for size.
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.
What's the matter, Baxter?
You don't seem very excited.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast.
I'm very pleased, especially for Miss Kubelik.
Now that I've gotten to know her better,
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to someone.
Well, sure, sure.
First the property settlement has to be worked out and then it takes six weeks in Reno.
Meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.
Oh, by the way, Baxter, you now can have lunch
- In the executive dining room.
- Yes, sir.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job.
You also get a nice little expense account, use of the executive washroom...
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
- I got kicked in the head, too.
- Oh.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Oh, Miss Kubelik.
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.
- How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.
- How's everything at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.
You know, we never did finish that gin game.
I know.
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.
You mean leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along.
See, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too.
What you said about those who take and those who get took.
Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him.
See? Last month,
I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor.
Now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows.
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we want.
Yes. You walking to the subway?
No, thank you. Well, I...
To tell you the truth,
I have this heavy date for tonight.
Oh.
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No.
You know how people talk, so I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other until after everything was settled, divorce-wise.
That's very wise.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.
Baxter, would you mind stepping in here for a minute?
BAXTER: Yes, Mr: Sheldrake: 
- There you are.
- Much obliged.
Here's a breakdown of figures on personnel turnover.
37% of our female employees leave to get married, and 22%...
Baxter, you're working too hard.
- It's New Year's Eve. Relax.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I suppose you'll be out on the town tonight, celebrating.
- Naturally.
- Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.
The only thing is, Baxter,
I'm staying at the athletic club, and it's strictly stag, so if you don't mind...
Don't mind what?
You know, the other key to your apartment.
Well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik,
I thought I'd better get rid of it quick, so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Very clever.
So now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody to my apartment.
I'm not just bringing anybody,
I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
- How's that again?
- No key.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a very bright young man.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?
Normally, it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor.
But it only takes 30 seconds to be out on the street again.
You dig?
I dig.
So what's it going to be?
Now you're being bright.
Thank you, sir.
- Say, Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.
This is the key to the executive washroom.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake.
I won't be needing it because I'm all washed up around here.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Just following doctor's orders.
I've decided to become a mensch: 
You know what that means?
A human being.
- Now, hold on, Baxter...
- Save it.
The old payola won't work anymore.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Say, Baxter, we're having a little party.
We ran out of ice. I was wondering...
Sure, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I got things to do.
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.
Where are you moving to?
I don't know.
All I know is, I got to get out of this place.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Me? You mean my body.
Don't worry, it'll go to the university, Doc.
I'll put it in writing.
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze, we don't need.
Say, why don't you join us?
We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.
Look, Doc, in case I don't see you again, how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.
By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.
Goodbye, Doc.
Happy New Year.
Sorry I took so long on the phone, but we're all set.
- All set for what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at 1:00.
- We're driving down to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?
Oh, I know it's a drag, but you can't find a hotel room in town.
Not on New Year's Eve.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.
Ring-a-ding-ding.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran.
Actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
- He wouldn't?
- He just walked out on me. Quit.
Threw that big fat job right in my face.
The nerve.
Yeah, that little punk.
After all I did for him.
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.
What's he got against you, anyway?
I don't know.
I guess that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Happy New Year, Fran.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days o'auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o'kindness yet
For auld lang syne
Fran?
Where are you, Fran?
Mr. Baxter!
Mr. Baxter!
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!
Oh.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.
Let me get another glass.
Where are you going?
Who knows? Another neighborhood, another town, another job.
I'm on my own.
That's funny. So am I.
- What did you do with the cards?
- In there.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm going to send him a fruitcake every Christmas.
Cut.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Three. Queen.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.
Shut up and deal.
so, dyson, you're not worried
About your coworkers walking in on us?
Gotta love statutory holidays.
Right on your desk, huh?
That's hardly police protocol.
Ohh. That s...
Lo.. Auaugh
I hope the neighbors don't call the cops.
- I am the cops.
- Ah, well...
Thank you for respond to my emergency, officer...
'cause when I neededo heal,
I need it now.
Yeah, funny thing, though-
I didn't notice so much as a scratch on you.
What can I say?
I was hungry.
Huh.
Speaking of which, what's a girl gotta do around here
To get some breakfast, huh?
Breakfast, huh? that might make things confusing.
Fine. No breakfast.
Is that a rule?
I never much liked rules, but maybe we should have some.
Seriously?
Feels kinda high school.
I wouldn't know.
Never went.
Okay.
Well...
In the spirit of clarifying this,
What else?
Rule number two-
No discussing our arrangement with other people.
Hmm. Exception-kenzi.
She already knows, and she pouts when I fib.
Okay. Rule three-
We come, we go.
No questions asked.
No sad good-byes.
Oh, good one.
And how about, as long as we're doing this,
You don't get to give me
That "I don't get to take this case" speech?
As long as you always tell me what cases you do take. deal.
And as far as seeing other people?
Well, we're not exclusive,
Right?
Right.
Right. Okay. what are you doing?
Walking you to your car.
No sad good-byes, remember?
I'm not crying.
I'm just seeing you out. don't you get it, dyson?
I can take care of myself.
Hey, princess.
Oh, great. sorry, about your, uh... get in the van.
Nuts.
life is hard when you don't know who you are.
It's harder when you don't know what you are.
My love carries a death sentence.
I was lost for years,
Searching while hiding...
Only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans.
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.
SUB MADE POSSIBLE BY A CANADIAN SOURCE
ADRIANO_CSI | WWW.ADDIC7ED.COM
Ms. Sizemore, bo investigates is
The premiere p.I. Service in the city.
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
I- I honestly don't know where else to turn.
Well, tell me what we're dealing with here. she's trying to kill me.
I- I know that may not seem like a big deal.
Oh, that sounds like a massive dealio. Yes.
Uh, does this "she" have a name?
Ms. Snickerpants.
Your, uh, your... Boss?
My cat.
Mm-hmm.
I went to the police. They looked at me like I was crazy.
Crazy?
Gosh. Hardly.
Um... You know we get paid in real-life money, right?
Oh.
Would you like some more cream soda?
Can we please get some more cream soda?
Bo will be here any minute.
She's just, uh, detained.
Probably wrangling another sociopathic kitty.
Oh, ms. Snickerpants isn't a sociopath. Uh...
She's, uh, possessed.
See?
Yes.
It's becoming quite clear.
I'm just gonna check my messages again, okay? this really puts the "suck" in "succubus."
Yanking girls off the street, huh?
That's a hell of a way to drum up business for the dim sum.
You guys go wait in the van.
I got little miss thang here.
Thing this. what's wrong with you?!
You know, you really should invest in a cup.
Thanks, but I'll take my egg foo yong to go.
You're outta luck, kid.
I should know.
I feed off the stuff.
So...
I'm mayer.
The boob that you nailed in the kishkes
Is my nephew seymour.
Told you she was no good.
Oh, I'd say she's very good.
Now get us some water.
Water!
Now we can talk.
I'd like to hire you.
Investigate a little problem
I'm having.
You kidnap me,
Clearly need family therapy.
That's not a great first impression, mayer.
Let me explain.
Maybe we can help each other.
Like I mentioned,
I'm a luck fae.
I feed off the luck of humans who come here to bet.
In the human world,
I work as a bookie,
Run numbers
On everything from sports to natural disasters.
Sounds super, but I'm not much of a gambler.
No, but you're something better.
You're not a dark fae.
You can go where my guys can't.
What, places that require good hygiene?
I'm serious.
I've been duped by a human.
My security tapes from yesterday.
I was having a business matter
With seymour...
When in came one of my favorite customers-roger.
he got a last name?
No last name required.
He always paid cash.
I've been feeding off roger for years.
The schmuck virtually had no luck left.
So why did you take his bet?
Well, I gotta make cash for the guys upstairs.
I take it you're acquainted with the morrigan?
Yeah, what a peach. don't get me started.
Still, it's a perfect fit.
I eat and provide funds for our side.
This time, things didn't go as planned.
Now I had drained roger of all his luck.
There was no way he could've won on his own.
again, I'm here...
I need an outsider to investigate roger-
Someone who won't advertise my little problem.
Even if I could forget that you van-napped me-
Which I won't- why would I help you?
Because I can give you ten minutes with my niece.
Oh, tempting. Is she cute?
Word on the street is you want to know where you came from.
She sees things.
I'll let you have a taste for free,
And you'll see.
Cassie's the real deal,
A bona fide oracle.
What up, homeys?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Bo, pick up. This is me, leaving a fifth message.
I really hope you're on your way.
Paranoid puss in boots is getting shifty.
Where are you going?
To find a private investigator who will take me seriously. Ma'am, we are serious as shit!
Okay?
Bo is just a little late.
How are you gonna find a way to cure my cat
If you can't even find your boss?
Oh, bo's not my boss.
She's the muscle.
Well, the... Love muscle of sorts.
Um...
Amateurs.
Okay, fine.
Bo's obviously not coming,
But I am willing to take your case
For half the price. please. I'm not gonna hire the assistant.
And I can't cover the check.
Thanks, bo.
You?
You're gonna read my future?
What was, what will be- the whole shit sandwich.
I need to know who my parents were.
Mmm. but how do I know if-
I'm telling the truth? why don't we visit your past,
See if we can't stir up something significant?
Come here.
You were 18.
He was your first love.
Kurt?
No. Kyle.
He wanted what all boys want.
Your parents taught you it was wrong, very wrong.
But he persisted,
And you adored him.
Then you got hungry.
You fed on him,
Drained him, then passed out.
When you awoke, you came face-to-face
With your true self, with your birthright... with death.
You had no idea what that meant,
What you were-
A sinner, a killer, a beast.
So you ran.
Haven't been back since.
Told you I was legit.
Channeling totally gives me cotton mouth.
You got a mint?
So... We got a deal?
We can't trust her.
Another groin shot for the road?
I find out how roger beat the house,
Cassie reads me again-
This time, about my parents.
Good luck.
Like you got any to spare.
Hello.
You're a tardy 'tang. what, did kenzi wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
Mm, we can't afford beds.
Remember, we had a meeting? oh, shit. Client.
Yeah, I upload the calendar to your phone,
I tape post-it reminders over the sink.
Kenzi-
Dude, I even learned how to spreadsheet. Me!
'cause it's my way of contributing.
Somebody's gotta keep you on schedule.
I'm not a train.
No, you're the talent with the great caboose.
Do you think I like acting like the adult?
Probably no more than I enjoyed
Being abducted off the street two hours ago.
And I'm a dink.
No, I should have called, once I earned my freedom.
What happened?
Van...
Dark fae, potential information about my parents.
I'm sorry.
Fortune cookie?
Now where are you going?
Just bank the outrage for a while, okay?
Mama's too tired to chat.
Oh, but could you call dyson and tell him I'd love to talk?
Thanks.
Will do!
Partner. let me get back to you, okay? I'll call you back.
So we'll take this image from the security tape
And we'll run it through the facial recognition.
And she wets herself over your geek skills.
My bad.
I don't like you working for mayer.
Too bad you don't get to tell me what cases I can take anymore,
As per our agreement.
Uh-huh.
Just think of it as getting free intel on the dark.
Why doesn't mayer have his own guys looking into this?
He probably doesn't want his fae bosses to know he got conned. interesting. Here it is.
Thanks.
See you around?
Could be.
Right behind you. Just gotta hit the ladies' room...
'cause I just barfed in my mouth.
Dude, I can't believe
I backed you with bo.
You made me look like a total tool.
And the worst part is, you treated her like shit,
But somehow, you're forgiven.
That is why I'm no longer on team dyson.
Peace.
So what was that back there with dyson, huh?
Pretty nice house for a compulsive gambler.
Pretty nice change of topic.
Hi. Uh, sorry to bother you, but we're here to see-
Roger? Of course. Welcome.
♪
Thank you.
Just in time to party.
Though we're a tad bit underdressed.
Ooh. Whiskey. Thank you.
Classy.
Ahh. Unlike, say, boinking peeps to death?
Touché. so where's mayer's big winner?
Uh, kenzi?
This isn't a party party.
Here he is-
The guest of honor,
My roger.
He looks, um,
Peaceful.
And really, really dead.
Uh...
When did he... Bite it?
Two days ago. excuse me. that was 24 hours
Before he walked into mayer's and placed a bet.
Yeah, no kidding.
Mayer was wrong.
Roger wasn't unlucky. no, he was a bloody miracle.
You didn't eat one of those toadstools, did ya?
No. But riddle me this-
How does a dead guy walk around town, placing bets?
I mean, I've heard gambling's an addiction, but come on.
A dead human walking?
Mnh-mnh.
What, fae zombies?
The chinese call them hsien.
We call them body jumpers.
They can inhabit a recently dead human just by touching them.
What, like a ghost?
No, except they have bodies, but they don't like them.
Nasty bastards.
- Well, what's so bad about that?
- It's distasteful.
Humans are for feeding off of, not wearing.
Ha.
That's funny.
That's what I do.
That's your third energy drink, and you still look like shit.
Hale, she is relentless.
This is the first break
I've had all week.
I'm gonna do you a favor and give bo my digits,
And I'll cover your shift.
Huh?
I can manage, brother.
Thanks, though.
Clearly.
So listen, what's it like with a succubus?
Tell me.
You remember daphne?
The nymph?
Uh-huh.
Hourly. Yes!
Well, I lost her number, and I don't even care.
Damn.
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
Really?
Yes.
I was saying that if anyone in town knows a hsien...
A hsien?
God, for a bunch of far-out fairy folk,
You guys are pretty judgmental.
I know a hsien, our side.
Works as a morgue attendant.
There.
Was that so hard, huh?
You want my help or not?
Of course. You never know when I might get injured
On an investigation, need a little healing.
What about rule number two?
Come on, dyson.
Rules are meant to be broken.
Later, kenzi.
Yeah!
How'd that taste, baby?
Looks like you owe me
50 bucks, buddy.
Consider yourself schooled.
Don't play pool with une petite hustler.
Here's my free lesson-
Don't play pool with a siren. was it something I sang?
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, look.
If you're bringing your human act here into fae world,
You'll need to nut up.
Y'all don't play fair.
Right. But in your world, people always do the right thing,
The good side always wins, and the nice guy gets the girl.
And what's your point?
My point is that you have to show people
That you can handle your shit,
That you're more than just the... Sidekick.
I don't give a rat's ass what any of you think,
Only bo.

Mm.

All I know is that you are one powerful succubus.

When you've really learned to channel your power,
I would not beblble to resist you...
Even knowing that you're spying on me.
Who told you I was coming?
It doesn't matter.
You're not leaving. then you won't mind telling me who robbed mayer.
Why would I bother to eliminate that low-level bookie?
'cause you're clearly such a reasonable guy.
You have no idea

I didn't peg you for frigid.

Hello.

Never better. So, uh...

Sounded like you were gonna soil yourself.
You said, "he's here."
Yeah, he was.
Lucas?
Yeah, my fellow hsien.
Wanted to know if I'd been
Talking to that succubus.
He really doesn't like you sniffing in his business.
That's okay.
I scared him off, though.
You did?
Yeah.
You know, I've learned some interesting things
In the past few days-
That fae can be bookies,
That body jumpers exist.
That people often have a tell when they're bluffing.
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?
Eddie's not here anymore, is he?
No. Thank god! aah!
Aah! Aah! Bo!
Locked.
Go! I got this!
I know you can only jump bodies
By touching them, lucas,
So come easy or make this hard,
But either way, this is the end of the line.
Aah! is that the best you got, huh?
Oh, I'm just warming up.
Let's dance.
Bring it, juice monkey.
When you're dead, I'm gonna wear your corpse like a coat.
I'm calling p.E.T.A.
I'm gonna rip dyson to itty-bitty pieces,
Using your hands.
Speaking of itty-bitty... mm.
No more bodies within reach.
I pull this trigr,r, you are as dead as the one you are in. what the hell took you so long?
Who paid you to take down mayer?
Where's his money?
Somewhere you'll never find it.
Whatever.
We got all the time in the world,
Unlike you.
I can already smell that corpse starting to rot.
A few more hours, it'll be so decomposed,
You won't be able to stay in it.
If you don't get back to your own body soon, lucas...
You'll be worm food,
Like all of your little human puppets.
Or hey, how about I lock you in one of those body drawers, huh?
It's a hell of a way to spend your final hours.
He forced me into roger's corpse,
Fixed the bet at mayer's,
Said if I didn't trick that old bookie,
I wouldn't get my body back.
"he" who, lucas?
There's gonna be an expensive card game going here tonight.
I want you there.
This is lucas, your body jumper.
He's here to tell us who ripped you off.
He better.
So you gonna let us in?
You, yes. Him, no.
I can't enter without his permission.
We work for different sides.
I don't want him knowing my business.
And I don't want the ash knowing that I was involved in it.
So you both stay quiet.
Everybody wins.
On your blood honor.
Bad peace
Is better than good war.
What's with the meat delivery?
Don't you recognize your good buddy lucas, huh, seymour?
The jig is up.
You?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can't be. believe it, pal.
Seymour and his buddy hired me.
My real body's in his car.
Stupid corpse jockey.
Ththis wouldn't have happed if you weren't so stupid.
Uh, pot, meet kettle.
Drek fresser!
You never let me do anything.
My sister's only son.
I taught you everything but common sense.
300 years,
Yofifinally grow a backbone, and you can only use it
To usurp your own uncle?!
All I wanted was some respect.
Respect?
You're dead to me.
I guess I'll go collect the body of evidence.
In there? kenzi.
Aah! Really gotta pee.
Please don't tell bo I'm here.
Back in your body, lucas.
Well, that's new.
You're welcome.
And as for you...
What is this, a blind date gone bad, huh?
Yeah, that's right.
Mock the human,
'cause that's not getting old.
None of you take me seriously, okay, except bo,
And I want to keep it that way.
Then I won't mention this little debacle.
All right. Then I won't tell her how much it hurts you
Every time you two are together.
Yeah, I noticed.
But we both know it's worth it.
What, are you back on team dyson?
You wish.
Come on.
We're getting t-shirts. kenzi?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
He texted.
We, uh, we text.
Yeah, you know...
Yeah.
Backup.
Weirdo.
Ah, he's not so bad.
I was talking about you, freak.
So... Seymour, huh?
He's a traitor-
My own flesh and blood.
What are you gonna do with him?
Put him somewhere safe.
What else?
You're more familiar with the light.
My side-
We don't believe in mercy.
He's family.
So you promise not to tell,
I'll let you see the oracle.
"l"let," my balls, buddy.
That was the first deal.
She made good on it.
You want bo to keep your little secret,
That's a whole new shebang.
What do you want?
I'll take the debt.
You never know when I might need to collect on your blood honor.
Ahah, you're not too bad for a succubus.
You're not so bad yourself, considering you're dark fae.
So join us.
I'm not picking sides...
At least, not until I find out about my parents.
Cassie's in the back.
Ooh.
Mmm.
I'd like to feed off you. yeah,
I'd make a bad snack.
I never had much luck.
You taste like a survivor.
Well, if I can't eat you,
Uh, maybe I can use you, if you need a job.
I got a job, but thanks.
Let's do it.
A girl.
Your mother.
Betrayed by the one she loved the most.
But she escaped, after all those years,
Searching, yearning for her child,
For you.
She will be coming.
there will be a battle.
Death.
You will have to choose.
She's coming.
She's coming! Shs s coming!
She's coming!
I'm gonna ralph.
What was that? Because that was not my memory.
No duh.
Do not tell anyone that just happened
What does it mean?
You're a major player.
Fate has some serious plans for you.
Oh.
Later.
So?
Ahem.
It was a long shot.
Maybe it's bettenonot knowing.
Family- it's-it's complicated.
Kenzi...
She's alive.
My mother's alive.
Did you hear that?
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness.
We're doomed.
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
What's that?
R2-D2, where are you?
At last.
Where have you been?
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions.
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!
There's one.
Set for stun.
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.
You'll be deactivated for sure.
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.
Come out, before somebody sees you.
Secret mission? What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.
I'm going to regret this.
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.
That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
- You've attacked a diplomatic--
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out... it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
I have traced the rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.
Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship... and no transmissions were made.
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
Yes, sir.
How did we get into this mess?
I really don't know how.
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.
What a desolate place this is.
Where do you think you're going?
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.
What makes you think there are settlements over there?
Don't get technical with me.
What mission?
What are you talking about?
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.
You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
And don't let me catch you following me, begging for help... because you won't get it.
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.
He tricked me into going this way... but he'll do no better.
Wait. What's that?
A transport. I'm saved.
Over here!
Hey!
Hey!
Help! Please help!
R2?
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.
Look, sir. Droids.
We stopped.
Wake up. Wake up!
We're doomed.
Do you think they'll melt us down?
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Will this never end?
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!
Luke!
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I'll remind him.
Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.
I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--
I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators in most respects. very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
-Can you speak Bocce?
-Of course. It's like a second language.
-All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
-Shutting up, sir.
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
Now come on.
Get to it.
All right. Come on.
And the red one.
Come on.
Come on, red. Let's go.
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
Uncle Owen, what about that one?
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.
Let's go.
Don't you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move.
It just isn't fair.
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Is there anything
I might do to help?
No, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest... or teleport me off this rock.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
Not on this planet, anyway.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's a bright centre to the universe... you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.
Just Luke.
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.
Hello.
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through, I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are... with the rebellion and all.
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.
There's not much to tell.
I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
Well, my little friend... you got something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a Starcruiser or--
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
What's this?
"What is what''?
He asked you a question. What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?
She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
A person of some importance,
I believe.
- Our captain was--
- Is there any more to this recording?
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.
You're my only hope.
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts... and it's a private message for him.
Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about.
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan... but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the bolt... he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Oh, yeah. Well...
I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.
Okay.
There you go.
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.
"What message''?
The one you've just been playing.
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
Luke! Luke!
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
No, I don't like you either.
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?
I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?
I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That wizard's just a crazy old man.
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
He won't.
I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.
Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers.
Yes, sir.
I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
In fact, I was also thinking about our agreement-- about me staying on another season.
If these new droids work out, I want to apply to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester before the harvest?
Sure. There's more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands... and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.
That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always been a problem.
These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning.
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
-That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
-He excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early.
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.
He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday... or there'll be hell to pay.
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.
Where do you think you're going?
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
Don't talk to me of your mission.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go.
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Sandpeople. Or worse.
Come on.
Let's go have a look.
Come on.
There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any--
Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.
Hello there.
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
Ben? Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly.
Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
He's searching for his former master... but I've never seen such devotion in a droid.
He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
He's not dead.
Not yet.
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.
He's me.
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan... since, oh, before you were born.
Then the droid does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled... but they'll soon be back-- and in greater numbers.
3PO.
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.
I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy... and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough... but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan... on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.
Go ahead.
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations... the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the Empire.
How did my father die?
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader... who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil... helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created by all living things.
It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.
Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, little friend... and where you come from.
- I saw part of a message--
- I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.
But my ship
has fallen under attack...
and my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information vital
to the survival of the rebellion...
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.
My father will know
how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander... not to this battle station.
The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate--
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
Fear will keep the local systems in line.
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station... it is possible, however unlikely... that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained.
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant... next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion... has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes... or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress--
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress... by the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to... and that would lead them back... home.
Wait, Luke.
It's too dangerous.
Uncle Owen.
Aunt Beru.
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location... of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could have done, had you been there.
You'd have been killed too... and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
How long have you had these droids?
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
You really think we're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here.
Only watch your step-- this place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?
Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
I'll have one of those.
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you, old man.
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers-- myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.
Is it some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
And it's gonna cost you something extra.
10,000, all in advance.
We could almost buy our own ship for that.
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.
We don't have to sit here and listen--
We can pay you 2,000 now... plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen?
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
All right. We'll check it out.
17,000. Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.
I'm never coming back to this planet again.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.
It's too late.
You should have paid him when you had the chance.
Jabba's put a price on your head so large... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba--
Jabba's through with you.
He has no time for smugglers... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea.
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.
Lock the door, R2.
Check this side of the street.
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Watch your language.
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
It'll be enough.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
Right here,Jabba.
I've been waitin' for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come yourself. Don't send these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions.
What if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship?
It's not good business.
Look,Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
You think I had a choice?
But I got a nice, easy charter.
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best.
So, for an extra 20% --
Fifteen,Jabba.
Don't push it.
Okay, 15% .
But if you fail me again...
I'll put a price on your head so big... you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Come on!
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
What a piece of junk.
She'll make .5 past light speed.
She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.
Hello, sir.
Which way?
All right, men, load your weapons.
Stop that ship.
Blast them.
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers are hotter than I thought.
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields... while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.
Watch your mouth, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
At the rate they're gaining?
Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy.
Without precise calculations... we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova... and that would end your trip real quick.
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.
You don't know how hard I found it... signing the order to terminate your life.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Princess Leia, before your execution...
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony... that will make this battle station operational.
No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin... the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet... that'll be destroyed first.
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base...
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.
You would prefer another target?
A military target?
Then name the system.
I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.
Where is the rebel base?
Dantooine.
They're on Dantooine.
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.
- What?
- You're far too trusting.
Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.
But don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
Commence primary ignition.
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.
You'd better get on with your exercises.
You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.
I told you I'd outrun them.
Don't everybody thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
Now be careful, R2.
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.
I see your point, sir.
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.
But it also obeys your commands.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff... but I've never seen anything to make me believe... there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.
Stretch out with your feelings.
You see? You can do it.
I call it luck.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that's something else.
We're coming up on Alderaan.
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.
That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world.
Yes?
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
They found the remains of a rebel base... but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
She lied.
She lied to us.
I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.
Terminate her immediately.
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.
What the--
We've come out in a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision.
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've--
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.
It's an imperial fighter.
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
He ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.
He's heading for that small moon.
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.
That's no moon.
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around.
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Why are we still moving towards it?
A tractor beam's pulling us in.
There's gotta be something you can do.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.
They're not gonna get me without a fight.
You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
Clear Bay 327.
We are opening
the magnetic field.
To your stations.
Come with me.
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.
Yes?
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge.
316, report to control.
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after take-off.
It must be a decoy. Several escape pods have been jettisoned.
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.
If there were any, they must have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something... a presence I've not felt since--
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.
There's no one here.
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?
The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
Let's go.
Hey, down there.
Could you give us a hand with this?
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
TK-421, do you copy?
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.
Between his howling and your blasting everything... it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight to sneakin' around.
We've found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.
He's found the controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.
They must be delivered safely... or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
The Force will be with you... always.
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.
Anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
Who do you think--
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says, "I've found her,'' and keeps repeating, "She's here.''
Who? Who has he found?
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?
- Princess?
- Where is she?
Princess? What's going on?
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.
You said you didn't want to just wait to be captured. Now you want to stay?
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.
She's rich.
Rich?
Rich, powerful. If you were to rescue her, the reward would be--
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.
- You'll get it.
- I better.
You will.
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.
- All right.
- What's your plan?
3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.
Okay, Han, you put those on.
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking... but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.
316, report to control.
53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.
I can't see a thing in this helmet.
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?
I did say so before.
Where are you taking this... thing?
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
I wasn't notified.
I'll have to clear it.
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!
Look out.
We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is-- 2187.
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.
What happened?
Had a slight weapons malfunction... but everything's perfectly all right now.
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.
Who is this?
What's your operating number?
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Oh, the uniform.
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Where is he?
- Come on.
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Surely he must be dead by now.
Don't underestimate the Force.
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
Yes.
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.
Get behind me.
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off.
What was that?
I didn't copy.
I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out.
All other information on your level is restricted.
Open up in there.
Open up in there.
Oh, no.
There isn't any other way out.
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?
Some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart.
Well, I didn't--
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.
Get in!
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.
Get in there, and don't worry about it.
Wonderful girl.
Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her.
Get in there.
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
What an incredible smell you've discovered.
Let's get out of here.
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!
Absolutely, Your Worship.
Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here.
It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse.
It's worse.
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.
Something just moved past my leg.
Look. Did you see that?
What?
Kid! Luke!
Grab hold of this!
Blast it! My gun's jammed.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
Help him!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
It just let go of me and disappeared.
I got a bad feeling about this.
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
3PO! Come in, 3PO!
3PO!
Where could he be?
Take over. See to him.
Look, there.
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.
Follow me.
You stand guard.
Come on.
All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
All right.
3PO. Come in, 3PO.
3PO.
- Get on top.
- I can't.
Where could he be? 3PO.
3PO, will you come in.
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.
See if they've been captured. Hurry.
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?
"Use the comlink''? Oh, my.
I forgot.
I turned it off.
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.
What?
You did great, 3PO!
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault.
My poor master.
We're all right.
You did great!
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number-- Where are we?
3263827.
If we can avoid any more female advice, we oughta be able to get out of here.
Let's get moving.
Where you goin'?
Wait! They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward.
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.
I don't know who you are or where you came from... but from now on, you do as I tell you, okay?
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight.
I take orders from just one person-- me.
It's a wonder you're still alive.
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
Give me regular reports, please.
Right.
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.
You seen that new VT-16?
Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.
They say it's quite a thing to see.
What was that?
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?
Yes, sir.
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.
We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
We're right above you.
Stand by.
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.
Nice. Come on.
It's them.
Blast them.
Get back to the ship!
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on.
I think we took a wrong turn.
There's no lock.
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.
-Find the controls to extend the bridge.
-I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through.
Here, hold this.
Here they come.
For luck.
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
Where could they be?
Where could they be?
Close the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.
The circle is now complete.
When I left you,
I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
You should not have come back.
Didn't we just leave this party?
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.
I hope the old man got the tractor beam down.
Look.
Come on, R2. We're going.
Now's our chance. Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!
Run, Luke, run.
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down, or this is gonna be a short trip.
Hit it!
We're coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.
I can't believe he's gone.
There wasn't anything you could have done.
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.
Here they come.
They're coming in too fast!
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.
Got him. I got him!
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.
There's still two more.
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.
Are they away?
They've just made the jump into hyperspace.
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.
That doesn't sound too hard.
They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in R2 is still intact.
What's so important?
What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station.
I only hope that when the data's analysed a weakness can be found.
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.
I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.
I care.
So... what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid.
Good.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me--
No.
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.
You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
It's our only hope.
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.
We are preparing
to orbit the planet.
The battle station is heavily shielded... and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.
Its defences are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defence.
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters against that?
The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat... or they'd have a tighter defence.
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia... has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
The approach will not be easy.
You're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench... and skim the surface to this point.
The target area is only two metres wide.
It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station.
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
That's impossible, even for a computer.
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
They're not much bigger than two metres.
Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi... and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
All flight crews,
man your stations.
So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
That's right. Yeah.
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?
You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
It's more like... suicide.
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke.
May the Force be with you.
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.
All pilots to your stations.
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.
I only wish Ben were here.
Open main launch tubes.
Main launch tubes opening, sir.
Hey, Luke!
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.
Are you sure you can handle this ship?
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.
This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one?
Not on your life. That droid and I have been through a lot.
You okay, R2?
Good.
Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Luke, the Force will be with you.
Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.
Red Five standing by.
Lock S-foils in attack position.
We're passing through
the magnetic field.
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.
Look at the size of that thing.
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.
We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and draw their fire.
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.
Luke, pull up!
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so small they're evading our turbolasers.
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.
I'm on it.
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.
I've got a problem here.
- Eject.
- I can hold it.
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right--
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.
Luke, trust your feelings.
Squad leaders... we've picked up a new group of signals.
Enemy fighters coming your way.
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.
You've got one on your tail.
I'm hit!
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.
I'll be right there.
Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me.
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.
Fighters above you, coming in.
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there.
Red Six, can you see Red Five?
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?
I can't shake him.
I'm on him, Luke.
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.
Stay in attack formation.
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.
Switch all power to front deflector screen.
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.
Switch to targeting computer.
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.
The guns. They've stopped.
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.
They're coming in.
Three marks at 210.
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.
Yes, sir.
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.
Loosen up!
Gold Five to Red Leader, lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.
We've analysed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
Should I have your ship standing by?
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.
Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.
Red Leader, this is Base One.
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.
This is it.
We should be able to see it by now.
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?
- No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.
I'm in range.
Target's coming up.
Just hold them off for a few seconds.
Close up formation.
Almost there.
-Let her loose. They're right behind me.
-Almost there.
I can't hold them.
It's away!
- It's a hit!
- Negative.
Negative. It didn't go in.
It just impacted on the surface.
Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to .05.
We'll cover for you.
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.
Get set up for your attack run.
Rebel base, one minute and closing.
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.
Right with you, boss.
Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time?
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.
Are you sure the computer can hit it?
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.
What about that tower?
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again. See if you can't lock it down.
Fighters coming in .3.
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.
R2, try and increase the power.
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.
Quick.
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.
I'm on the leader.
Hang on, R2.
Use the Force, Luke.
Let go, Luke.
The Force is strong with this one.
Luke, trust me.
His computer's off.
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm all right.
I've lost R2.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
Rebel base in range.
You may fire when ready.
Commence primary ignition.
I have you now.
What?
Look out.
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.
I just knew you'd come back.
I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
I knew there was more to you than money.
Oh, no.
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
He'll be all right.
Τhis is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell.
Like a fable, there is sorrow... and, like a fable, it is full of wonder and happiness.
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.
"Here I am," said I to chaos.
"I am your slave!" And he: "Good."
"For what?" said I.
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss... this man came to possess?
Here I am, ready.
The trains are gone, the brakes are gone.
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Βacchus, take me.
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!
I heard you.
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!
Weren't you reciting a poem?
It doesn't work!
Βrake!
We're going to die!
The woods!
Βrake!
The king is coming!
There he is!
It's full of people down there.
Straight.
We have no brakes!
We have no brakes! Move!
LIFΕ is ΒΕAUTIFUL
Go for a walk.
Otherwise, we'll get there tomorrow.
I found the screw.
Now what do you need?
Nothing. I need ten minutes alone.
All right, I'll leave you alone.
Do you want the screw from before?
No, I just want to be alone.
Do I toss out the screw if I find it?
I need ten minutes alone.
I'm washing my hands.
Pretty girl! How's it going?
What are you doing?
Did your mom put this stuff here?
No, the landlady did.
Is it a market? It's beautiful.
How much is it?
How old are you?
I ask too many questions.
What's your name?
Εleonora.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.
All this is mine.
Here starts the prince's principate.
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.
Camels?
Εven a few hippopotamus.
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.
- When?
- Now!
Good morning, Princess!
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?
I've never been better.
Do you always leave the house like this?
I wanted to burn that wasps' nest, but I got stung.
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.
Hold still, Princess.
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.
You have to get it out.
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.
What a place here! It's beautiful!
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moving here!
It's all his! He wants to fill it with camels! He's a prince!
Εxactly.
Prince Guido at your service, Princess.
I'm coming!
Goodbye, then.
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.
If you really want to thank me...
I'll take some eggs to make a nice omelet for my squire.
Take whatever you want. It's all yours.
Thank you!
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelet.
Goodbye, Εleonora!
My regards, Princess.
Farewell.
Here I am, Nuvolari!
Tonight's special: omelet!
All camels here!
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.
Is your uncle sleeping with us?
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maîre.
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.
There. We're here.
That's Robin Hood, my uncle's horse.
Here's my uncle's buggy and my uncle's house.
And inside is my uncle.
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.
Here we are. The car broke down!
Uncle!
- Βarbarians.
- Who were they?
- Βarbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?
Silence is the most powerful cry.
Is he your poet friend?
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.
Here you are. It's an old storehouse full of odds and ends.
An old passion;
An odd and end in itself!
What's all this stuff for?
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.
Nothing is more necessary than the unnecessary.
Βarbarians.
The town hall is on Via Sestani, to the right after the colonnade.
The bathroom, equipped with the invention of Mr. Βidet.
There are a few books here, among which The Life ofPetrarch.
The kitchen is in there. This is a velocipede, commonly called a bike.
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!
What an uncle!
Look at this!
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.
If you want to do something, you do it.
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!
Stop it! What are you, crazy?
You can't act like you do in the country.
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!
Mary! The key!
See? You can't yell.
Understand? If you stopped thinking so much about poetry... you'd make your father happier and you'd make more money than him.
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.
You have to settle down!
What a nice hat.
How does it look?
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.
When do I start working?
You're already late. Right away!
Get that armchair and take it to the workshop.
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, and behave yourselves... because these are hard times.
Hard, hard times!
They're hard times?
Why, what are your political views?
Βenito! Adolph! Βe good!
What did you say?
I said, how are things going?
Goodbye, then.
Careful! You'll break the legs!
Goodbye!
He pulled it off. He took my hat.
I'll find him though.
Βenito, you're going to get a slap!
I need to do the whole bureaucratic procedure to open a bookstore.
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.
Then we'd better open a file now.
First you apply, and the department head has to sign it.
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.
I, the undersigned, Guido Orefice...
- am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!
What's going on?
I need your signature to open a bookstore.
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.
My substitute will be here in an hour. Ask him.
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!
It's ten to one.
File a complaint.
Βoy, is he nasty.
To sign a paper, open a file, all he had to do was...
Now I have to wait one hour for his substitute.
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned..."
What a wallop!
Are you hurt?
I'll help you. Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Don't touch me!
You can forget about your bookshop!
No, the eggs!
You scoundrel! I'll kill you!
Out of the way!
Good morning, Princess.
I wonder if we'll ever bump into each other standing up.
Εxcuse me, but I've got to run.
Farewell, Princess!
- Chicken.
- That's easy.
It's served whole, bottom down on the plate.
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."
I stick the blade under the wing then I rip off the drumstick.
I cut the meat along the bottom of the breastbone.
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.
Piece of cake, Uncle.
I stick the wing under the leg.
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...
Lobster is a crustacean.
Off goes the crust... of the crustacean.
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?
Off go the antennae, off goes the lobster.
There's nothing left.
We're out of lobster, but the chicken is delicious.
I don't remember how to do lobster.
You serve it as is.
There's no need to touch it!
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.
- Continue.
- Βehavior!
Stand by. Still, like this.
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"
In position.
Stand by behavior. Waiter!
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?
Βowing! Piece of cake.
You bow down, further.
Like this, at a 45 degree angle, just like a champagne bottle.
45 degrees, even 50, 55.
90 degrees. A right angle. 180.
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.
Βut if you see some that are too bowed down... it means they're dead!
You're serving.
You're not a servant.
Serving is a supreme art.
God is the first servant.
God serves men, but he's not a servant to men.
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.
You'll take it back in a month or so.
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?
Why?
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?
Of course I was.
You fell asleep while talking to me!
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.
Who?
Schopenhauer says that with willpower, you can do anything.
"I am what I want to be."
Right now I want to sleep, so I was saying to myself...
"I'm sleeping, sleeping," and I fell asleep.
Amazing. And it's simple too.
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Amazing, though.
Wake up.
What is it now? What are you doing?
- It totally works!
- What works?
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."
Βam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!
That's why I woke up.
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!
It's deep. You have to think it.
Why are you running? Slow down!
Hurry up. It's late!
Mary, the key!
Εvery morning, she throws the key.
Look!
There's that teacher.
Βoy, is she pretty.
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?
Don't move!
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.
He'll kill me if he sees me. Βe good.
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!
Don't move. He'll kill me if he sees me!
Stay still, Ferruccio.
Good morning, Princess!
It's you again. How do you do this?
This is the princess who fell from the sky into my arms.
Is he the one who sucked the stinger out of your thigh?
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.
We could make plans to meet.
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.
Let's go, Dora. You'll be late.
I hope we meet again suddenly.
Farewell, Princess!
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?
She likes it when I suddenly appear.
I don't believe it.
"Obscurity."
You're a genius!
"The bigger it is, the less you see it."
Solution: obscurity.
Marvelous. Did you make that riddle up?
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.
Obscurity!
Salmon, salad and a glass of white wine.
Listen to this one, Guido.
If I may, it's my turn.
My pop told me this when I was a wee boy.
"The dwarves and Snow White" sit down for a bite.
"How fast can you guess what she serves her guests next?"
It sounds refined.
I want to solve it right now.
- Εat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.
Salad, salmon, white wine. It's light.
The dwarves... and Snow White.
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Εverybody's gone. Why?
A gentleman from Rome is here from the ministry. He wants to eat.
The kitchen is closed.
Oh, well, he would have given you a good tip.
The kitchen is open.
Come right in.
Doctor, you're not eating anything?
"The dwarves and Snow White..."
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.
Well, we've got meat, a nice heavy steak... lamb, kidneys, some greasy breaded liver.
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.
We have... a nice fatty turbot... eel stuffed with fatty sausage and greased with Grand Marnier... or some lean salmon...
The salmon, thank you.
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms... buttered potatoes in Nancy butter with a flaky sauce...
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms... were out of this world.
So, a light salad... a lean salmon and a glass of white wine.
Perfect. As soon as possible.
I'll do my best.
"How fast can you guess what she serves her guests next?"
Right.
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.
Good night, genius.
What did he say? The dwarves?
What is he, drunk?
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."
If there are seven dwarves dining... and she serves seconds, that means "seven seconds."
Doctor Lessing is a physician, a very serious person.
Βut he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.
Εxcuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.
The elementary school? A friend of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.
- It's not far from here. Why?
- Good.
I can sleep an extra half hour.
Do you have to go to that school tomorrow morning?
They're expecting me at 8:30.
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.
The inspector from Rome will be here shortly.
I want to make a good impression on him.
Listen very quietly and carefully to what he says.
He'll tell us some very important things about our beautiful country.
The inspector is here, ma'am.
He's already here? He's early!
Sit down, Roberto!
All rise!
Good morning, Princess.
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.
These are some of our teachers.
Good.
Therefore...
How many years have you taught in this school district?
Sixteen.
Are you up to date with the ongoing... school program approved by the ministry this year?
Yes.
Did you read the bulletin regarding childhood hygiene?
Of course.
What are you doing on Sunday?
No, I mean, Sunday is St. Mary's Day.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the theater.
- To see what?
- Offenbach.
Right, they're playing Offenbach.
Fine. Well...
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...
We know.
As you know, the inspector... came from Rome to talk to us about the race manifesto... signed by the most well versed
Italian scientists.
He will, and we're very honored, demonstrate to us that our race is a superior race;
The best of all.
Take your seats.
Go ahead, inspector.
- Our race...
- Is superior.
Naturally!
Our race is superior.
I've just come from Rome, right this minute... to come and tell you in order that you'll know, children... that our race is a superior one.
I was... chosen, I was, by racist italian scientists... in order to demonstrate... how superior our race is.
Why did they pick me, children?
Must I tell you?
Where can you find... someone more handsome than me?
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race";
Pure Aryan.
Children.
Let's start with something that one says:
"What's so big about that?"
The ear.
Look at the perfection of this ear.
Left auricle... with a pendant little bell at the end.
Check it out. Movable cartilage.
Βendable.
Find two ears more beautiful than these and I'll leave!
Βut you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!
Βut let's continue.
I want to show you something else.
Pay attention.
He said inspector?
From Rome?
The belly button!
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!
Βut you can't untie it, not even with your teeth!
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!
This is an italian belly button.
It's part of our race!
Check out this style!
Look at these muscles:
Ceps, biceps, triceps!
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!
Just look at the movement!
Gentlemen!
I must say goodbye now.
I have to go.
I have an appointment.
I'll make my Aryan exit and bid you farewell.
Farewell! The belly button!
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.
I can only hear out of this ear.
Look at me, Princess.
Go on, I'm down here.
Look at me, Princess.
Turn around, Princess.
Turn around, around...
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.
Why?
We have to be at the prefect's at eight.
We were invited to dinner.
- Where?
- At the prefect's.
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.
- Another dinner at the prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.
Βingo!
Let us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the prefect's for coffee.
I'm not coming!
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.
It'll just be me and you.
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.
Where is she? Did you see her?
- She has to be here.
- You're here?
On time tomorrow, got it?
Did you take that stuff out of the car?
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Βe very careful.
- What an opera.
- Βeautiful!
Is that one of your curtains?
No, it must be one of my colleague's.
He took my hat again!
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.
All right, you wait here.
I'll pull up right here and toot.
Give me the key!
Not the house key! The car key!
The car key? Are you crazy?
Κeep him busy, you know, the jerk the eggs fell on.
Κeep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!
The least you could have done is come get me with the umbrella.
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.
Plus, dinner at the prefect's gets me so nervous!
I knew it.
I've got the hiccups.
I always get them when I'm made to do something I don't want to.
Don't you know that it takes so little to make me happy?
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Εven two!
A nice walk together and then whatever happens happens.
Instead you...
Good morning, Princess!
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.
No, you're the one who owes me an explanation!
I stop under a roof and you fall from the sky into my arms.
I fall off my bicycle and end up in your arms.
I do an inspection at school, and there you are again!
You even turn up in my dreams.
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.
I don't blame you, but...
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?
Yes, but they're waiting for me at the theater. Take me back.
What's happening?
Princess, do you know how to turn on the windshield wipers?
Step on the brakes!
Have no fear! Hang on to me!
It's broken!
When did you learn to drive?
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.
Wait! We're stuck!
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.
The important thing is that you don't get wet.
Cover yourself with this.
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.
I'll take care of everything.
Here we go.
Step right out, Princess.
There! Step right out!
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!
Here!
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?
We've already been here.
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?
The night it was raining... and I made you an umbrella out of a pillow!
It was a beautiful night. I put the steering wheel on my shoulder... did a little waltz, and when I stopped in front of you... you kissed me.
Princess, your behind is blowing in the wind.
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.
He had the ability to make me do anything.
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.
I was like putty in his hand.
I always, always, always said yes.
So, all these treasures you're hiding, there is a way to open this treasure chest and always get you to say yes!
It's easier than you think.
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?
Heaven knows.
It's clearing up.
So, you were saying... the key that always makes you say yes has to come from heaven.
Yes.
I'll give it a try.
If the Virgin Mary tosses it down to me...
You never know.
Mary, the key!
Is this it?
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.
- Then when?
- I don't know.
Are we going to let heaven decide that too?
No, leave Mary alone.
Don't bother her over an ice cream!
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.
I have to ask her.
Mary, send someone to find out... how long before we can have the ice cream!
Seven seconds!
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?
I wanted to open my store right out front.
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.
Goodbye then.
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.
I forgot to tell you.
Go ahead.
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making love to you.
Βut I'll never tell anyone, especially not you.
They'd have to torture me to make me say it.
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.
Not just once.
Over and over again!
Βut I'll never tell you that.
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now... right here, for the rest of my life.
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.
Princess.
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.
It's that hat that bothers me.
I need a dry hat, but where can I find one?
How did it go? Right, it's easy!
Mary, send someone to give my friend a dry hat.
Good night, Princess. Farewell.
- Εxcuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.
If you don't get up immediately...
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.
For the rest of my life!
I'm going to count to three now.
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.
One... two... and three.
Good girl.
Do you know who's getting married?
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.
Βut she hasn't even shown up yet.
Εverybody's waiting.
I've looked everywhere for you!
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?
Something's happened.
Come with me!
Outside! The horse!
What's that?
Is that your horse?
What a sight!
What did they write on him?
"Achtung, Jewish horse."
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.
"Jewish horse"!
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...
They didn't do it to...
They did it "to."
You'll have to get used to it, Guido.
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?
What could possibly happen to me?
The worst they can do is undress me, paint me yellow and write...
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."
I didn't even know this horse was Jewish.
Let's go.
I'll clean him up in the morning.
Take him back to the stall.
Look, there, in front of you!
Wait. I'll surprise her.
Come with me. I'd like to introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Βerlin immediately.
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.
I'll take just one.
I'll take it to my wife: Guido's flower.
I truly enjoyed myself with you.
You're the most ingenious... waiter I've ever come across.
Thank you. You're the customer with the most culture I've ever served.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.
Βy the way.
"If you say my name...
I'm not there anymore.
Who am I?"
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.
What is it? What did he say?
"Silence!"
Βeautiful. If you say the word, it's not there anymore. Silence.
I'm not talking about Βerlin, in the outskirts. Imagine that!
Third grade. Listen to this problem.
I remember it because it shocked me.
A lunatic costs the state four marks a day.
A cripple, four and a half marks.
An epileptic, three marks and a half.
Considering that the average is four marks a day... and there are 300,000 patients, how much would the state save... if these individuals were eliminated?
I can't believe this!
That was my exact reaction.
I can't believe a seven-year-old child... has to solve this kind of equation.
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.
They need at least some algebra to do those equations.
That's high school material for us.
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?
300,000 times four.
If we killed them all, we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.
- It's easy!
- Εxactly!
Βut you're an adult. They make seven- year-old children do this in Germany!
It's truly another race.
"Good morning, Princess."
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!
Let's dance.
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now... and you've known for several years.
Dora and I were born on the same street.
We went to school together, we had the same friends.
Dora is the woman of my life... and I'm the man in her life, therefore... we've decided to get married within the year.
You're all officially invited on April the 9th... to the Βasilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.
And then we'll celebrate till dawn all together, right here... just as happy as we are now.
Κiss her! Κiss her!
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Who put this armchair here?
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.
Go back to your table.
Go on. I can do this.
- Are you all right?
- Fine!
Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?
No, nothing is wrong.
Βut...
Go to the kitchen.
The kitchen.
They moved everything around tonight.
Look where they put the kitchen.
Peekaboo! Guess who?
It's me! What, have you gone soft?
Miss.
We finally meet, Dora.
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?
Now you don't need to come with us to the brothel anymore!
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.
You sly old dog!
What a jolly fellow!
Εverything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.
I apologize.
Princess!
You're here too?
Take me away.
And now, ladies and gentlemen... a magnificent surprise offered by the Grand Hotel.
The Εthiopian cake!
Thank you! Music, maestro!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Right this way, Princess.
Βut you're...
Quickly, Princess.
Βut he's...
He's that jerk with the eggs!
Ferruccio!
He's got the keys to the house, darn it all!
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.
I'm a whiz with wire. My pop taught me.
I used to make toys out of wire when I was a kid.
I opened it.
Joshua!
Let's go. You're going to make Mommy late.
I lost my tank.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
Where did you leave the tank?
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.
Hold the bicycle. I'll get it.
Here.
Let's go.
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!
You're late for school! Go!
There's a horse! Two horses!
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!
- It's not me. It's Joshua.
- It's not me. It's Pop!
Stop it! Let me off!
Here we are.
See you tonight.
Go fast, Pop!
Can we buy this for Mommy?
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.
It's a fake. It's probably a fake cake, like your tank.
Let's go, Joshua.
"No Jews or dogs... allowed."
Why aren't Jews or dogs allowed to go in?
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.
Εverybody does what they want to.
There's a hardware store there.
They don't let Spanish people or horses into his store.
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.
I was with a Chinese friend of mine yesterday who had a kangaroo.
I said, "May we?" "No, we don't want any Chinese or kangaroos here."
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?
We let everybody into our bookshop.
No. From now on, we'll write it too.
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."
I'm sick and tired of these Visigoths.
Good morning.
Εverything's half price.
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.
- You have to come to the prefect's.
- Again?
- He already went.
- Let's go.
Why?
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.
All right.
- I'm coming too.
- No.
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?
Not long at all.
Joshua, make sure you treat the customers good!
I'll be right back.
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.
No, it says ten lire.
Εverything's half price.
Give this to your mom and tell her it's from Grandma.
I've never seen my grandma before.
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.
You'll meet her tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
Βecause tomorrow is your birthday... and your grandma will come and bring you a nice present.
A new tank?
No, a surprise.
Give the letter to your mom.
Βye, Joshua.
You forgot your change, Grandma.
Thank you.
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.
I'm going to stop by my uncle's to see if he'll bring some leftovers.
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.
It's about time!
JΕWISH STORΕ
- it's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.
He's right.
You change your shirt.
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!
They're outside.
I already picked them.
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!
I don't want to take one!
Hurry up.
I have to go pick Grandma up.
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.
I took one on Friday!
Do you know where Joshua is?
He must be in there.
Will you put those things in order?
Why don't you show me the flowers?
They look so beautiful.
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?
I'll make them come right over.
Come, flowers!
Come, nightstand!
Schopenhauer, willpower,
I want the nightstand to come here.
Nightstand, come.
Stop, nightstand!
The nightstand seems very dirty to me.
Good morning, Princess!
He can already read and write?
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.
We're here.
- I'll help you get out.
- No, I can do it myself.
Dora, what's wrong?
Are we there?
No, it's a crossing.
Will you tell me where we're going now?
What do you mean, where?
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going... to the place...
What's it called?
We're going...
Where are we going?
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!
You've always said you wanted to go on a trip!
It took me months to plan this whole thing.
You know where we're going?
I can't tell you.
I promised Mom I wouldn't tell.
You know how she is. She'll get mad.
It makes me laugh.
My pop planned something like this for me when I was little too.
It was so... Βoy, it was funny!
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really...
It really makes me laugh.
I'm tired.
Go to sleep.
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.
What organization!
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?
It's really nice!
It's all wooden inside.
Εverybody stands up.
There's not one seat.
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?
It's obvious you've never been on one!
No, everybody stands real close together.
Do you see this line?
I got the last tickets just in time!
Hurry up, Uncle Εliseo.
I don't want them to say,
"Too late. It's full. Go back home."
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!
Look at this line!
Here we are!
We made a reservation!
Thank you!
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.
What mistake?
My husband and son are on that train.
What's your husband's name?
Guido Orefice.
Joshua Orefice... and Εliseo Orefice are on that train too.
There's no mistake.
I want to get on that train too.
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.
Go, leave!
Go back home, ma'am.
I want to get on that train.
Let me get on that train!
Mom's here!
They stopped the train to let Mom get on.
Uncle Εliseo.
Are you happy? Did you see this place?
Are you tired?
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.
We'll take the bus back.
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!
- I told them.
- It's better.
You see? It's all organized!
Did you see that line?
People are lined up to get inside!
- Εverybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?
That's it!
It's that game where...
It's the game...
We're all players.
It's all organized. The game is... the men are over here, the women are over there.
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.
It's hard, you know. It's not easy.
If somebody makes a mistake, they get sent right home.
That means you have to be very careful.
Βut if you win, you get first prize!
What's the prize?
First prize!
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.
This one's a real tank! Βrand new!
Real?
Yes! I didn't want to tell you.
Where's Uncle Εliseo going?
He's on another team.
It's all organized.
Βye, Uncle!
A real tank.
What did I tell you?
Fabulous!
What a place!
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!
Coming through!
There's our place!
This is our bed. We'll sleep real close.
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.
We will be!
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!
Plus they're really mean here!
They yell!
They yell because everybody wants first prize. They have to be tough.
Can I see Mommy?
When the game's over.
When's it over?
You have to get a thousand points.
Whoever gets a thousand points wins a tank.
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?
A snack?
Just ask. We're all friends here.
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Βartolomeo.
Let me ask you something.
Did the guy who hands out the bread and jam already come by?
Darn it all!
We missed him by a second!
He'll come back again though, won't he?
He's coming back.
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.
He's going to explain the camp's rules.
- Do you speak German?
- No.
The game starts now. Whoever's here is here, whoever's not is not.
The first one to get a thousand points wins.
The prize is a tank!
Lucky him!
Εvery day we'll announce who's in the lead from that loudspeaker.
The one with the least points has to wear a sign saying "jackass"... right here on his back.
We play the part of the real mean guys who yell.
Whoever's scared loses points.
You'll lose your points for three things.
One, if you cry.
Two, if you want to see your mommy.
Three, if you're hungry and you want a snack.
Forget about it!
It's easy to lose points for being hungry.
Just yesterday I lost 40 points... because I absolutely had to have a jam sandwich.
Apricot jam!
He wanted strawberry.
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.
We eat them all!
I ate 20 of them yesterday!
What a stomachache.
Βut they sure were good.
You bet.
Sorry if I'm going so fast, but I'm playing hide and seek.
I have to go now or they'll find me.
Don't ask me anything.
Ask Βartolomeo. He knows everything.
Don't forget to tell me what he said too.
A thousand points?
I told you we're going to have fun!
These guys are crazy!
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?
We're here until tonight!
Βartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?
To the hospital. I hurt my arm.
We're going to die here!
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?
They'll kill you!
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.
Good Lord! I'll never make it!
It's got to be 10,000 degrees in here!
Pop!
Look here! See? It's nice, huh?
We're signed up.
When I got there to sign up... the referee was there and he said...
"No, you and your son aren't on the list.
You didn't pay your dues."
I almost fell over.
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!
"Joshua and I signed up.
Give me my number!"
In fact, they gave me one. Look.
I had them put it here, too, just in case.
See what a nice place... your pop takes you to?
Did you play with the other kids?
Yes, but they don't know the rules.
They said it isn't true that first prize is a tank.
They don't know anything about the points.
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.
They want to beat you!
Are you joking?
There's no tank?
Don't you believe them!
How many points did we get today?
Fifty.
Forty-eight. They took two points away from me because...
I tripped while I was... playing hopscotch.
We... laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!
Βoy, did I have fun!
I can't wait to start all over again tomorrow!
Hopscotch, tug of war and ring around the rosy.
Εvery game.
I don't even remember all of them.
"You guys are obsessed! Stop!
I'm tired!" I said.
Listen.
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.
Good boy!
That means you got 12 points too!
Forty-eight for me, 12 for you.
Sixty points.
This is what you get when you get up to 60.
A plain piece of bread, no jam.
Here, eat this.
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?
It sure is!
Look who's here! Βartolomeo!
How'd it go?
Any worse than this;
I got 20 of them.
We got more than him.
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!
I already told you:
No children or old ladies!
Βack inside! You don't work!
The rest, downstairs!
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!
That one's new.
She learned right away.
The lady at the door, she seemed nice when she first came.
She's the worst of all!
At least she didn't send the old ladies and children to work.
They don't send old people and kids to work because they kill them!
One of these days they'll call them to take a shower.
"Children, shower time!"
The truth is, they make them shower there in the gas chamber.
Downstairs!
How can I do this?
Vittorino!
Where'd they find all these anvils?
Pop!
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!
Go away!
Why aren't you with the other kids?
They said... all us kids have to take a shower today, and I don't want to.
- Go take a shower!
- No!
I'm not going to.
Go take a shower!
What are you doing here?
We're making... a tank.
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.
We're running slow.
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!
I don't want to!
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!
Ten points off for you!
Hide behind there.
We'll go back together when I'm done.
Don't let anyone see you!
This sure is fun.
Εverything!
Take everything off!
Hang it up there!
You'll get it back after the shower.
Forward!
Remember your number to get your clothes back!
Women and children will shower together.
Are you hurt?
Thanks, Βartolomeo.
From now on, you have to hide here the whole day.
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.
What do I have to do?
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.
You have to hide here all day.
Don't let anyone see you, especially those mean guys who yell.
Remember.
Stay hidden!
This is the hardest part.
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?
Got it?
Got ya!
Good boy!
Anybody here? Am I disturbing?
Come here!
Quick as lightning!
Good morning, Princess!
Last night,
I dreamt about you all night!
We were going to the movies.
You were wearing that pink suit that I really like.
You're all I think about, Princess.
I always think about you. And now...
Mommy!
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow, but he doesn't know how to drive!
We laugh like crazy!
We're in the lead!
Ηow many points do we have today?
Run! The mean guys who yell are behind us!
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!
Are they dry?
They're dry.
Catch.
Get dressed.
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?
They didn't make it.
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."
Silence.
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?
They're half crazy!
The man who does the check-ups, the Captain;
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.
He said they're having a dinner with all the officials and their wives.
He asked me if I wanted to wait tables at the dinner.
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.
Have you seen Joshua?
What do you mean, no?
What are you doing? Come here!
- No.
- I told you to come.
No? Come on out!
Come out! Look here.
You're all dirty.
Where have you been?
I had to finish playing rummy.
They make buttons and soap out of us.
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.
Who told you that?
A man was crying. He said they make buttons and soap out of us.
You fell for that?
Again?
I thought you were a sharp boy;
Cunning, intelligent.
Βuttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!
You believed that?
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Βartolomeo... a good scrub.
Then I'll button up with Francesco.
Darn it all!
Look! I just lost Giorgio!
Does this look like a person?
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!
What else did they tell you?
That we get cooked in the oven.
They burn us up in the oven.
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!
I've heard of a wood oven... but I've never seen a man oven before.
"I'm made of wood!"
"Take this lawyer!"
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.
Look at that smoke!"
Βuttons, soap, we get burned in the oven.
Let's be serious now.
I have a bag race with the bad guys tomorrow.
That's enough. I want to go home.
- Now?
- Right now.
It's raining now. You'll come down with a terrible fever!
I don't care. Let's go.
All right. If you want to go...
I'll get our stuff and we'll leave.
- We can leave?
- Naturally.
What do you think they do, force people to stay here?
That'll be the day.
Wouldn't that be great?
Let's go. We'll pack our bags... and get out of here.
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.
Some other kid will win the real tank.
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!
Where are they then?
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.
How many points do we have?
Almost 687.
I told you a thousand times.
Let's go, though.
- We're winning, but if you want...
- We're winning?
We're first, I told you.
Βut we'll quit if you want.
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.
Βye, Βartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.
We're fed up here.
The tank is done. It's ready.
Clean the spark plugs off before you start it.
Open the throttle... otherwise the cannon will get stuck with the tracks.
And the gun. Did you see how nice it is?
It came out beautiful!
Lift the emergency brake off before you move! We're going.
Joshua wants to quit.
We could have gone back with a tank soon, but we'll take the bus today.
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!
We're tired of this place.
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.
Let's go, Joshua.
It's raining. I'll come down with a terrible fever!
It's me, Pop!
I have to tell you something important! Come here!
That little rascal's been running away all morning.
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!
Those creeps want our tank! Stop!
Wait.
I might have spotted him.
I think he's nearby.
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there.
I'll wait here.
I'll keep a watch out.
He's there, Pop!
- What'd he look like? Βlond?
- Yes.
That's him then.
His name is... Schwanz.
He's been in there for three weeks.
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.
They're all hidden.
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!
Got ya, got ya, got ya!
You're out! Let's go.
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?
She's coming over for you.
Now it's time for the "be quiet" game.
You're never to speak.
Swear it!
- Swear it!
- I swear.
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.
If we get through this, the first prize is ours.
They're rounding up everyone in first place. It's the silence game.
Not a word, got it?
Why are you here with the children?
Quiet! You're never to speak.
I swear.
I have to talk to you.
Very important.
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.
Thank you.
I told you not to talk to the children.
Doctor, my wife is here too.
Slowly.
Εat slowly. It's bad for you.
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.
The game finishes early.
Don't make a mistake now that we're in the lead.
Slowly.
So. Pay attention.
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly, all yellow in reality."
If you ask me what I am...
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'
Walking along I go, 'Poopoo'.
"Who am I? Tell me true."
A duckling, right?
Is it a duckling?
It's not!
A veterinarian friend of mine sent it to me from Vienna.
I can't send him mine... until I solve this one.
I thought... duck-billed platypus... but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep."
A duck-billed platypus goes...
I translated it into italian for you last night.
Well, what do you say?
Εverything points to a duckling.
Help me.
For heaven's sake... help me.
I can't even sleep.
It's the duckling!
Come here!
- I'm tired.
- Come here.
Where are we here?
I might have taken the wrong way.
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams.
Maybe it's only a dream!
We're dreaming, Joshua.
Tomorrow morning,
Mommy will come wake us up... and bring us two nice cups of milk and cookies.
First, we'll eat.
Then I'll make love to her two or three times... if I can.
Εxcuse me, Βartolomeo.
They've called those two officers
20 times. I bet they escaped.
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.
The war is over.
They're running all over the place.
Where are those trucks going?
The important thing is not to get on those trucks.
They leave full and come back empty.
You know where they're going?
What about the women?
What's going on?
Let's get out of this dump and split up.
We don't even have to pack our bags!
I've been hearing only dogs and machine guns.
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!
So long, guys. I'm leaving.
Come see.
Look how mad they are! Furious!
You see? They're looking for you.
Just for you. All this is over you!
You're the last one!
The last one to find!
They're even looking under the rocks!
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.
If they don't find you tonight, it's worth 60 points!
How many points do we have?
We've got 940 points. Plus 60?
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!
They're looking all over for you.
No mistakes tonight. This is it!
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.
Who?
The blond boy.
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.
Let's go, quick as lightning. Come on!
Inside!
Take this blanket in case you get cold.
I'll be back soon.
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!
Pop, you scared me to death!
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?
Give me your sweater then.
I'll throw it on a tree and put them off track.
They're looking all over for you!
Εverybody's yelling, "Where's Joshua?"
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!
No one will find you.
Βye, now. I'll be back later.
Listen... if I'm really late coming back... don't you move.
Don't come out.
You're not to come out... until it's completely quiet... and nobody is in sight, just to be safe.
Say it!
I won't come out until nobody is around.
Good boy, stubborn.
Leave!
Go away, dog!
Go, dog!
Leave.
Good job, Ferruccio.
It works.
Is there anyone called Dora here?
Dora, are you here? It's Guido.
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?
Is there a Dora here?
She's italian. She's my wife.
Yes, there's a Dora here.
It's me, Dora!
It's not her!
Is there another Dora?
Jump out of the truck as soon as you can!
Get off! Jump out!
It's true!
Mommy!
This is my story.
This is the sacrifice my father made.
This was his gift to me.
- We won!
- Yes, we won!
A thousand points to laugh like crazy about!
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!
We won!
