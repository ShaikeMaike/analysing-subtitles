THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION,
WHY LEONARD PARKER
FOUND HIMSELF
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.
ONE, IN AN ARMORED PORSCHE,
2, WEARING BALLET SLIPPERS,
AND 3,
ON THE BACK OF AN OSTRICH.
ALL IN THE SPACE OF ONE WEEK
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
MR. PARKER,
WHOM I HAVE THE HONOR
TO SERVE,
IS A MAN
OF EXCEPTIONAL TALENTS,
WHOSE 5 PREVIOUS ADVENTURES
WOULD, I'M SURE,
HAVE ENTHRALLED YOU,
HAD THEY NOT BEEN CONFISCATED,
IN THE INTERESTS
OF WORLD SECURITY.
IT ALL BEGAN
UNDER THAT FAMOUS BRIDGE
WITH A TEAM OF FROGMEN,
NOT, I HASTEN TO ADD,
ON OUR SIDE.
[water bubbling]

QUINCY, THE WATER'S BEAUTIFUL.

OH, QUINCY,

THIS WAS, I BELIEVE,
THE FIRST RECORDED INSTANCE,
OF A C.I.A. AGENT
BEING EATEN ALIVE
BY A RAINBOW TROUT.
AND WORSE WAS TO COME.
WE'VE LOST 8 AGENTS
THIS MONTH.
BUT HOW DO WE STRIKE BACK
AGAINST FEROCIOUS FISH?
WE BLOW 'EM OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
WE'VE GOT THE CAPABILITY.
I HOPE YOU KNOW I SYMPATHIZE
WITH THAT PASSION, JACK,
BUT WE CAN'T.
WE'VE GOT TO LEARN
THEIR SECRET,
AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
ABOVE ALL,
WE MUSTN'T PANIC.
OH, YES, WE MUST.
IF SAN FRANCISCO GOES,
TOMORROW IT'LL BE OREGON.
AND THEN,
THE REST OF THE WORLD.
IN MY LIFETIME,
I'VE ONLY WORKED WITH ONE MAN
WHO CAN MATCH
THE BRUTALITY AND HEINOUS WIT
THAT'S BEHIND THESE SORDID
AND UNPATRIOTIC EXECUTIONS.
MR. SNYDERBURN,
YOU DON'T MEAN--
YES.
HE RETIRED.
HE'LL NEVER COME BACK.
HE'LL COME BACK.
I'LL SEND MONROE TO GET HIM.
[people chattering]
MMM. THAT LOOKS
WONDERFUL.
LEONARD.
(Frayn)
RETIREMENT BORED MR. PARKER.
AND HIS ENORMOUS WEALTH
GAVE HIM LITTLE CONSOLATION.
AS A DIVERSION,
HE OPENED A RESTAURANT,
WHICH NATURALLY BECAME
SAN FRANCISCO'S FINEST.
YES, MR. MONROE?
I'M AFRAID
IT ISN'T FRESH.
UH, WHAT ISN'T FRESH, SIR?
THE TROUT IS NOT FRESH.
OH, BUT, SIR,
WE--WE KEEP OUR FISH
LIVE IN A TANK.
OH. WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D SHOW ME THE TANK.
OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO.
FOLLOW ME.
[people chattering]
SO HERE IT IS.
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT TROUT.
WOULD YOU PREFER
THE FLOUNDER?
DON'T GIVE ME THAT!
I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
IS GONNA DO FOR MY CAREER,
ELIMINATING
THE NUMBER ONE AGENT
IN THE WESTERN WORLD?
BUT I'M NOT
THE NUMBER ONE AGENT.
I RETIRED 7 YEARS AGO.
YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT
NICK SNYDERBURN SAYS.
SNYDERBURN?
NOW DON'T BE NERVOUS, NOW.
OH, I'M NOT NERVOUS,
YOU KNOW.
AH, CREPES FLAMBE!
[bullets ricocheting]
MAKE SPAGHETTI, SCOTTY.
[machine whirring]
[gun firing]
[glass shattering]
AH.

GO EASY, MONROE.

GOOD TO SEE YOU!

WHY...
WHY DID YOU SEND MONROE
TO KILL ME?
SUPPOSE MONROE
HAD GOTTEN LUCKY
AND KILLED ME.
THEN YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN RIGHT FOR THE JOB.

MALFORD WILSON, VIRGINIA.
HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM,
ASSAULTED ON STATE ROAD 306
BY 18 SQUIRRELS,
AND LEFT FOR DEAD,
WHICH, OF COURSE,
THEY WERE.
WORST OF ALL,
RIGHT IN THIS AREA,
AN AS YET UNKNOWN NUMBER
OF APPARENTLY FURIOUS GOPHERS,
ATTACKED AND KILLED
OUR UNDERCOVER COOK.
THIS IS THE WORK
OF A SINGLE,
HEINOUS ORGANIZATION,
UNDER THE DIRECTION
OF A MANIACAL,
AND SADISTIC WOMAN.
SHE'S A VEGETARIAN,
A FORMER ECOLOGIST,
AND SHE'S BENT ON
TAKING OVER THE WORLD.

THIS HEINOUS WOMAN
HAS DEVELOPED A FORMULA
WHICH CAN CONTROL

[Snyderburn]
LEONARD.
YOU GOTTA COME BACK WITH US.
(Frayn)
MR. PARKER
HAD ALWAYS EXPECTED
THAT ONE DAY
HE WOULD HEAR ONCE MORE
THE CLARION CALL OF DUTY.
BUT NEVER
IN HIS WILDEST NIGHTMARES
DID HE IMAGINE
THAT HE'D BE ASKED
TO PIT HIS RESOURCES
AGAINST FEROCIOUS FELINES
AND HOMICIDAL SQUIRRELS.
THAT VERY MORNING,
I HAD TAKEN A MESSAGE
FROM THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES
ASKING MR. PARKER
TO CALL BACK
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THAT CALL AND THIS MEETING
COULD HARDLY BE UNCONNECTED.
FACED WITH
THIS KIND OF PRESSURE,
HOW COULD HE SAY NO?
NO.
WE NEED YOU, LEONARD.
YOU DON'T NEED ME.
YOU NEED THE A.S.P.C.A.
WE'LL PAY YOUR REGULAR FEE.
$6 MILLION.
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST BLOW HER UP?
WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
I'D RATHER DO THAN THAT.
BUT WE CAN'T.
WHAT SHE'S GOT
COULD BE USEFUL TO US.
NO.
BUT WHY NOT, DAMN IT?
I HAVE MY REASONS.
OH, YEAH.
HIS WIFE.
HE QUIT THIS ORGANIZATION,
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
IT WOULD GET HIS WIFE BACK.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE WON'T EVEN RETURN
YOUR PHONE CALLS.
SHE NEEDS TIME.
IT'S BEEN 7 YEARS.
7 YEARS, A LIFELESS DRUDGE.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT COMING BACK WITH US
MIGHT JUST WIN HER BACK.
[squelching]
MONROE!
YOU KNOW, LEONARD,
MY DEAREST FRIEND,
JUST LOOK AT YOU.
IT'S NO WONDER THAT GORGEOUS
AND VOLUPTUOUS CREATURE
DOESN'T WANT
YOU AROUND ANYMORE.
THAT'S ENOUGH, SNYDERBURN.
WELL, YOU'RE MY DEAREST
FRIEND AND--
YOU'RE NOT REMOTELY
MY DEAREST FRIEND.
AND I HAVE A KIWI TART
THAT DEMANDS
MY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.
I KNEW IT.
WE'RE ALL GONERS.
[squelching]
OH, SHUT UP, MADISON.
[door slams]
(Frayn)
IT'S TRUE THAT MR. PARKER
WOULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING
TO BE RECONCILED
WITH HIS WIFE.
HE EVEN GAVE UP THE SERVICE.
HIS WIFE THOUGHT
INTELLIGENCE WORK
MEANT RUNNING
AROUND THE WORLD,
JUMPING INTO BED
WITH A LOT OF BLONDE PEOPLE.
SO HE GAVE IT UP,
HOPING ONE DAY
SHE WOULD RETURN.
[Leonard sighing]
DID SHE CALL?
NO, SIR. SORRY, SIR.
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
FRAYN.
OH, I CAN SEE
MY DAUGHTER'S HERE AGAIN.
THAT'S NOT
THE HALF OF IT, SIR.
DADDY!
HI, HONEY!
[both laughing]
OK, NOW WHAT ARE YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER
FIGHTING ABOUT?
NOTHING. NOTHING.
HUH?
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHAT DID YOU DO?
WELL, SHE STILL REFUSES
TO ALLOW ME
TO EXPRESS MYSELF.
AND SHE MAY NOT EVEN COME
TO THE OPENING NIGHT.
HMM.
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL BE THERE
ON THURSDAY, RIGHT, DADDY?
NO, YOUR FATHER WILL BE THERE
BEFORE THE STAGEHANDS ARRIVE.
SEE, I KNEW YOU WOULD.
AND I AM SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS PLAY, DADDY.
I JUST KNOW IT'S GONNA
MAKE ME A STAR.
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE?
HMM. YOU-YOU'RE GOING STEADY
WITH THE LEADING MAN.
THE DIRECTOR.
AND DADDY,
HE IS WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.
HE'S WONDERFUL?
AND HE'S
IN THE DRAWING ROOM.
IN THE DRAWING ROOM.
COME ON.
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO HIM.
OK.
MMM-HMM. WONDERFUL.
DADDY, MEET
GIORGIO FRANCOSI.
CIAO, LEONARD.
A PLEASURE.
IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD A FIGHT
WITH YOUR MOTHER ABOUT?
DADDY.
WELL, HE'S NOT
STAYING HERE, EITHER.
I'D NEVER BE
SO PRESUMPTUOUS.
I ONLY WANTED TO MEET
THE FAMOUS FATHER,
OF THE BRILLIANT WOMAN
WHO STOLE
NOT ONLY MY HEART
BUT WHO'S ABOUT TO STEAL
THE HEART
OF ALL SAN FRANCISCO.
BY FRIDAY MORNING,
REZAZI BENZUR SHAHEED PARKER
WILL BE A STAR.
WHO IS THAT?
THAT'S MY STAGE NAME.
IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS,
THIS WOMAN HAS GROWN
FROM A CALLOW,
INSENSITIVE CHILD
TO A MATURE--
JOANIE, GET YOUR FATHER
A SANDWICH AND SOMETHING COLD
TO DRINK.
NOW, PLEASE.
WHAT IS THIS?
UH, WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE'RE IN LOVE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED.
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
RIGHT.
SHE'S 2O YEARS OLD.
RIGHT.
AND YOU'RE 65?
I DON'T WANT A 66-YEAR-OLD
SON-IN-LAW.
YOU'RE ROBBING THE CRADLE.
YOU BENT ON YOUR
POINT OF VIEW?
SOME SAY JOAN
IS ROBBING THE GRAVE.
[coughing]
WELL, I'M NOT
PAYING FOR THE WEDDING.
HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING?
HERE, DADDY.
DADDY, LOOK AT THIS FACE.
MY LITTLE CANNOLI.
[speaking Italian]
WHAT, UH,
DID YOUR MOTHER SAY?
[speaking Italian]
YOU THINK I SHOULD I CALL HER?
HMM?
[bumping]
FRAYN!
GOOD NIGHT, UH, SERGIO.
HUH?
FATHER, IT'S GIORGIO.
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU BROUGHT IN HERE,
GOOD NIGHT.
CIAO.
YES.
LEONARDO.
YOU STAY. YOU STAY!
SIT DOWN.
GOOD NIGHT,
SOMETHING SPECIAL.
[door closing]
COULDN'T YOU HAVE FOUND
SOMEBODY 45 YEARS OLD?
THIS MAN IS OLD ENOUGH
TO BE MY FATHER.
MUST YOU INTERFERE
IN MY LIFE, DADDY?
YOU'RE JUST LIKE MOTHER.
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE
THAT I REALLY WANT TO BE
AN ACTRESS.
AND BEING AN ACTRESS IS
WHAT I INTEND TO DO
WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE.
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO
FORGIVE YOUR MOTHER,
BECAUSE A MONTH AGO,
YOU WANTED TO BE A SCULPTOR
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
A MONTH BEFORE THAT,
YOU WANTED TO BE A BUDDHIST
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
AND A MONTH BEFORE THAT,
YOU BOUGHT, UH, LUGGAGE.
THAT'S TRUE.
AND NO OFFENSE, DADDY,
BUT I JUST DON'T
WANNA BE IN JUST
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.
I NEED TO EXPRESS MYSELF,
AND I NEED TO EXPERIENCE LIFE
AT ITS MOST RAW.
MOTHER DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND THIS.
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A WEDDING,
AND THEN MAYBE
A WEEK LATER,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PAY
FOR A FUNERAL.

ANOTHER FUNERAL WAS IMMINENT.

I HAVE NOT BEEN WITH A WOMAN

I'VE ALMOST FORGOTTEN

TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT, SIR,
EVEN IF THE GIRL WAS ONLY 19.
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
BUT TO BE FAIR, SIR,
MRS. PARKER DID FIND
THE TWO OF YOU
NAKED IN THE SAUNA,
SWITCHING EACH OTHER
WITH BIRCH LEAVES.
I NEVER LAID A FINGER

NO, SIR,

SIR,

IT WARMED MY HEART
TO SEE MR. PARKER SO HAPPY.
HE'D WAITED 7 YEARS
FOR THIS EVENING,
SO HE'D LEFT NOTHING
TO CHANCE.
HE WAS WEARING
THE PERFECT SUIT,
CARRIED THE PERFECT FLOWERS,
AND IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF,
HAD CHOSEN THE PERFECT TIE.
WHEN THEY'D SEPARATED,
HE HAD MOVED AWAY
AS FAR AS HE FELT
HE POSSIBLY COULD.
I LEFT HIM ALONE
WITH HIS THOUGHTS
DURING THE AGONIZING RIDE
TO HER HOUSE.
ALL THE BEST, SIR.
[doorbell chiming]
GOOD EVENING, SIR.
MADAM IS EXPECTING YOU.

WISH YOU GOOD LUCK, SIR.
THANK YOU.

OH, SIR,

WELL, I'VE MISSED

HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
MY OLD DOG, BRUTUS,

AND, DUCHAMP, MR. PARKER AND I
DO NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED.
YES, MA'AM.
I AM SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE.
I'VE COUNTED THE MINUTES,
TOO, LEONARD.
I WAS SO EXCITED
T0 SEE YOU TONIGHT.
GOOD.
THERE'S BEEN
SO MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN US
THAT SOMETIMES I FEEL
WE'VE ALMOST BECOME
STRANGERS.
TONIGHT IS
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
TO REMEDY ALL THAT.
YES. OH, YES.
OH.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SO SORRY.
IT WILL COME OUT.
I WAS HOPING THAT TONIGHT
WE COULD PUT THE PAST
BEHIND US.
EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW, LEONARD,
I'VE NEVER LOVED ANYONE
AS MUCH AS I LOVED YOU,
AND IT WAS PAINFUL,
EXTREMELY PAINFUL
WHEN THAT INCIDENT
OCCURRED.
WELL, YEAH,
IT WAS PAINFUL
FOR ME AS WELL,
BUT, I MEAN,
THAT'S BEHIND US.
THAT'S THE PAST.
I MEAN, YOU SAID IT. THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
LEONARD,
I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
BUT I'M HAVING
A LOT OF TROUBLE
NOT REMEMBERING
YOU WITH HER.
EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE,
I SEE THAT 19-YEAR-OLD.
I--I UNDERSTAND.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I MADE YOUR FAVORITE.
OH.
OH.
THANK YOU.

YOUR NEVER-ENDING SONG.
OH, JAMIE, I CRAVE YOU.
I CRAVE YOU AS I SEE YOU
EACH MORN OF OUR FOND,
ILLICIT LOVE.
[audience applauding]
[man whistling]
[inaudible]
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
[people chattering]
[people laughing]
WELL, IT'S OK, YOU KNOW.
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT MY PARENTS ARE HERE.
YOU KNOW, JOAN,
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT
YOU HAD YOUR CLOTHES OFF.
YOU WERE SPIRITUALLY
NAKED OUT THERE TONIGHT.
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.
DADDY.
EVERYBODY,
THESE ARE MY PARENTS,
MR. AND MRS. PARKER.
I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO SAY HELLO.
HI.
HI.
DID YOU LIKE IT?
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
[people chattering]
WELL, IT WAS DIFFERENT.
PARKER,
YOU WERE MARVELOUS TONIGHT!
OH!
MAY I SEE YOU OUTSIDE
FOR A WHILE, PLEASE?
OF COURSE, LEONARD.
BYE, DAD.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT...
OH! WHAT A GREAT FUTURE.
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
LEONARD, I KNOW.
THE 2ND ACT
DOESN'T QUITE WORK.
I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT--
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT MY DAUGHTER!
EVEN SHE CAN'T HELP
THAT 2ND ACT.
I'M NOT TALKIN'
ABOUT SAVIN' THE 2ND ACT!
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
SAVIN' YOUR LIFE!
GIORGIO!
CIAO.
[bumping]
LEONARD, LEONARD,
WHY DON'T YOU GO IN THERE
AND TALK TO JOAN RIGHT NOW?
PLEASE, DEAR, PLEASE
DON'T ASK ME TO TALK,
ESPECIALLY TO HER.
PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT. I WILL.
[thumping]
(Frayn)
WHEN YOU'VE SURVIVED
VICIOUS VEGETARIANS
AND TAKEN A BULLET
FROM YOUR SHOULDER,
YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR DAUGHTER
FLAUNTING HER FULL
FRONTAL CHARMS
TO AN AUDIENCE OF STRANGERS.
IT WAS TIME TO ASSERT
HIS PARENTAL AUTHORITY.
[mumbling]
THEY'VE GOT MOM!
A WEIRD GUY WITH RED HAIR
TOOK HER AWAY.
[Joan sobbing]
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL GET HER BACK.
THEY GOT MRS. PARKER.
WE GOT TO GET THE SPHERE.
PUT THE FOOT TO THE GAS.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A SIMPLE WAY
TO MAKE THIS THING WORK.
I NEED THAT SPHERE.
ONE COULD RULE THE WORLD
WITH THIS THING.
[beeping]
IT ISN'T ENOUGH
WE HAVE TO STOP HER
FROM CONTROLLING
THE ANIMALS.
HE WANTS TO
CONTROL THE ANIMALS.
IT'S NOT ON, SIR.
NO.
I KNEW WE WOULD
NEVER GET THIS TO WORK.
HOW'S EVERYTHING
GOING, TEAM?
LEONARD, WE CAN'T STILL
FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET THIS THING TO WORK.
OH, REALLY?
THE RED LIQUID
NEUTRALIZES THE ANIMAL'S
PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM,
LEAVING THE BRAIN PAN FLACCID
AND OPEN TO ENCRYPTION,
BUT THE PUZZLE IS
HOW DID THIS WOMAN
ACTIVATE THEM?
MAYBE YOU HAVE
THE WRONG RABBIT.
I KNEW WE GOT
THE WRONG RABBIT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
FRAYN?
UH-HUH.
MAYBE IT'S THIS ONE.
COME HERE, FELLA.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
UH, YOU ALL STEP
OVER THERE.
NOW STEP OVER THERE.
AND LET'S SEE.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE.
NOW, DID YOU GIVE IT
THE LIQUID?
SURE.
AND IT'S ALL
ACTIVATED THERE?
WELL, I THINK THE ONLY THING
MISSING HERE
IS TO SAY THE WORD
QUELISH!
[all screaming]
NOW, LET'S SEE MEDUSA
AND GET BACK MRS. PARKER.
[groaning]
[beeping]
OPEN THAT THING UP.
IN HERE, SIR?
SHE MUST BE PLANNING
TO DILUTE THAT CONCENTRATION
AND PUMP IT INTO
THE ENTIRE BAY AREA.
LOOKS LIKE
DISHWASHING LIQUID.
[beeping continues]
[car engine revving]
[tires screeching]
A PERFECT MATCH, SIR.
[horn honks]
[tires screeching]
(man on T.V.)
WATCH OUT!
BANDIT ON YOUR 6!
HE'S CLOSING FAST!
[honking]
[tires screeching]
THEY KIDNAPPED MY WIFE.
THIS--THIS WOMAN.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
[car honking]
[tires screeching]
[nurse chanting]
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
[chanting]
WHAT IS IT?
GO, GO AHEAD.
I TRUST YOU.
[horns honking]
[tires screeching]
[gibbering]
OH!
[speaking foreign language]
BUTTER?
[speaking foreign language]
MEAT PATTIES?
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
LET THEM THAW.
LET THEM THAW.
LET THEM THAW.
[tires screeching]
OOH! OOH!
WHAT'S THIS FOR?
[tires screeching]
AH! FRAYN.
ARRIVEDERCI.
OH, FRAYNIE.
I GOT YOUR BALL,
NOW LET ME IN.
[whooshing]
[screeches]
[beeping]
[screeching]
WELCOME BACK, LEONARD.
MAY I HAVE
MY WIFE BACK, PLEASE?
(Medusa)
NOT SO FAST. THE SPHERE.
[beeping]
WHERE IS SHE?
I WANT MY WIFE BACK.
(Medusa)
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
LEONARD PARKER.
LEONARD!
ALLISON!
WHERE IS SHE?
LEONARD!
LEONARD!
IT'S A SIMPLE HOLOGRAM.
I WANT MY WIFE BACK!
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW,
LEONARD?
YOU TOLD ME IF
I BROUGHT YOU THE SPHERE,
YOU'D GIVE ME
MY WIFE BACK!
(Medusa)
I LIED.
THE COUPLE
THAT SPIES TOGETHER,
[guns cocking]
DIES TOGETHER.
MY WIFE IS NO SPY!
I NEEDED A RHYME.
QUIET!
[beeping]
SO YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD FOOL
MEDUSA JOHNSON
BY PUTTING DISHWASHING
LIQUID INTO MY SPHERE.
SO?
SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS IN IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
YOU RESTAURANT SPAZ.
IT'S NOT THE LIQUID
THAT MAKES THE MAGIC.
IT'S THE MOLYBDENUM
CHROMIUM CATALYST.
I COULD PUT YOO-HOO
IN THIS THING,
AND IT WOULD WORK.
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A COLLEGE GRADUATE.
TAKE HIM TO ANNEX 3.
KILL HIM.
[belching]
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,
LEONARD.
PAY ATTENTION TO
YOUR LAST MOMENTS ON EARTH.
THIS, I HOPE,
WILL BE THE DARKEST NIGHT
OF YOUR CRIMINALLY
INSENSITIVE EXISTENCE.
HI.
HANDS OFF!
[sheep bleating]
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO THESE ANIMALS?
I HAVE DONE
THE UNTHINKABLE.
TOLD THE ANIMALS
THE TRUTH,
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED
AND TORMENTED BY MAN
FOR 2 MILLION YEARS.
IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES,
I WILL SWITCH ON
THESE DISTRIBUTION PUMPS.
THE CONTENTS
OF THE VATS UPSTAIRS
WILL FLOW INTO
EVERY SINGLE WATERWAY
IN THE BAY AREA.
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
WILL BE LIBERATED,
AND THE WORLD
WILL SHUDDER.
WHO'S PAYING FOR ALL THIS?
I DIDN'T HAVE BACKING
FROM ANY GOVERNMENTS
OR BIG BUSINESSES.
NO. THEY ALL THOUGHT
I WAS INSANE.
I DID IT ALL MYSELF.
A SELF-MADE WOMAN.
ALL I HAD TO START UP WITH
WAS POOR ANDY'S
DISABILITY INSURANCE,
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH.
NOW, MARCH.
LEONARD!
DARLING,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
W-WHAT'S GOING ON?
KEEP ME, BUT RELEASE HER.
SHE'S INNOCENT.
NO ONE RELATED TO YOU
IS INNOCENT.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?
KILL HIM.
YOU'RE RIGHT,
AS ALWAYS, ANDY.
GOOD-BYE, LEONARD.
AND TACKY-TACKY WIFEY.
THE OFFENSIVE
WILL START IMMEDIATELY.
[Medusa laughing]
DID YOU POUR
THAT FOOD ON ME
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME
OR HATE ME?
DID YOU POUR
THAT FOOD ON ME
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME
OR HATE ME?
BOTH.
[squealing]
LEONARD.
WHAT'S THAT?
[Allison screaming]
WHERE'S YOUR
RUBBER BANDS, FELLAS?
[beeping]
IN 5 MINUTES
AND 32 SECONDS,
ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
WILL BE OURS.

LEONARD!
GET THEM OFF!

LEONARD!
THERE ARE MORE COMING!
WHAT'S THAT,
LEONARD?
MELTED BUTTER.
MELTED BUTTER?
MELTED BUTTER.
YES, MELTED BUTTER!
AND IF YOU DON'T
CUT THE WIRES,
I'M GOING TO THERMIDOR YOU.
MELTED BUTTER! PULL!

GET THAT SPHERE.
NO, I DON'T, EITHER.
LEONARD PARKER!
IF YOU DON'T GET THE SPHERE
AND SAVE THE WORLD
AND STOP MEDUSA,
YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT EVER SEEING ME AGAIN.
IF I SAVE THE WORLD,
WILL YOU MOVE BACK IN WITH ME?
YOU SAVE THE WORLD

MR. PARKER'S DAUGHTER

MR. AND MRS. PARKER

IN A MOST APPROPRIATE FASHION.
I LOVE YOU.
TONIGHT?
TONIGHT.
LET'S EAT.

Still.
Wiegend.
I wish to enrol.
To enrol? Certainly?
This way...if you please.
Keine Bewegung, bitte.
Moment, bitte.
Außergewöhnlich...
Sir? Herr Benjamenta?
I'm here to enrol.
These are students I have hammered into Europe.
Bitte, setzen.
Asseyez-vous!
So...Name. Date of birth.
It's on the concession.
Und so weiter, und so weiter.
Etc, etc...
..etc, etc.
Das ist?
Ah...
Von Gunten.
Eintausend, zweitausend, dreitausend, viertausend, fünftausend.
Jakob.
A few other details, Herr von Gunten.
Wollen doch mal sehen.
Ja.
Ganz gute Reaktion.
I have sought entrance to the Institute Benjamenta as a student...
..in order to acquire the necessary knowledge for being a servant...
..as I have no high hopes of life.
I hope - no I am quite certain - that I am fit.
I...
Glitschig.
I hope I am quite certain that in some measure
I am fit to be of service to someone in this life.
To someone in this life.
Jakob von Gunten wishes to affirm that he...
Drei, vier, fünf, sechs.
..wishes to affirm that it is a matter of indifference to him what he is ordered to
Sechs, sieben, acht, neun...
..as his modesty knows no bounds.
Zwölf.
Ja...ein kapitaler Zwölfender.
Ugh. Agh.
It's good your hair is short.
There's an epidemic of tics...
..in the forest here.
You can put aside any idea of preferential treatment.
You're all one size here.
You can go now, von Gunten.
The class of life has already started.
Don't I get a receipt?
Go! Raus!
Kapitaler Zwölfender.
Flammenartige...
I refer you to your manuals, the chapter headed...
..The Divine Duty of Servants.
Danke.
Jakob von Gunten.
Gut.
Herr Jakob, these are your fellow students.
Kraus.
Auclair. Barcelonnette.
Fridolin. Fisoloebede.
Schilinski. Nyepertatikva.
Jorgenson. Aarhus.
Hebling. Fnetenberbel.
Pepino. D'Agrigento.
Inigo. Euskadikoa.
One.
Service is a beautiful, gold flower, full of...
We have to learn the rules by heart.
There is but one lesson here...
..endlessly repeated...
..over and over again.
One will learn very little here.
And none of us will amount to much.
Later in life, we shall all be something very small and subordinate.
..are his ears at the word of command, and folded and pressed at all times are his lips.
Except to say, 'Yes, sir, at once, sir. Of course, sir.'
Next page.
Herr Jakob, will you please join us next time?
Three.
The satisfaction of his master shall be the servant's heaven.
The woeful opposite is his annihilating hell.
Can't. Can't. Can't eat this. It's impossible.
I won't. I won't.
I won't stand up until you promise me a decent room to sleep in.
Fräulein Benjamenta, I beg of you.
You... You won't ever, never, never, never, have to complain about my behaviour again.
Is that so?
I shall never have to complain?
Such a fuss about where to lay your head.
Hm.
Go up.
Is this more to your liking?
Well, it's small... and the window scarcely merits the name.
There are no curtains, but don't be angry, Fräulein, I like it.
Even if the sun never gets a look in.
I like it.
Thank you.
Well...
Well, now my comrades are sure to feel offended.
And now be quiet, Herr Jakob.
Class commences at eight. Kraus will collect you.
Good night.
I shall never let myself be rescued...
..nor shall I ever rescue anybody.
Why can't there be a light in the light, instead of just in the dark?
Perhaps I shall never put out roots and branches.
One day, some fragrance will issue from my being and I will flower.
I will bow my head, and my arms and legs will sag.
Everything will wither and fade...
..and I will be dead.
Not really dead.
Only in a certain sort of way.
Dead.
Then I will go on dying for perhaps another 60 years.
Instead of older, I grew younger.
Whoever thinks this possible will be happy for the rest of his life.
Once great snowflakes fell in the castle courtyard.
To live on here until the winter only.
Then when it begins to snow...
Oh...
It can snow upon us so gently... so intensely...
..in such an immense...
..silence.
Neither beginning nor end, everything in a grey-white snowing...
..no more sky, no more air.
No more streets.
Rule the world.
Sometimes more life lies hidden in the opening of a door than in a question.
Past and future circle about us - now we know more...
..now we know less.
To the deer forests.
And what was the institute before it was the institute?
Is life sketching a more subtle sketch than I?
Here they find the things Fräulein Benjamenta teaches us...
..worth knowing.
It isn't much and we are always revising.
But perhaps there is some hidden meaning to all these nothings.
We grasp a thing and it is as if it possessed us.
Not we possess it, but it us.
Sir, I have rescued the cat from the tall tree in the garden.
Be careful, Viscount, the steeple, it is wobbling!
Agh!
Be careful, Viscount, the church steeple, it is wobbling.
Agh!
Be careful...
Your Highness, don't eat the schnitzel. It's...
Agh!
The institute is no place for your vile fantasies,
Duchess.
Please remove your hand from my knee.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
I have placed the children in the care of the chief of the fire brigade.
There is no need to worry.
Look, there are only minor burns to my left side.
You go to the children. Forget about me.
Yes, I forgive you for you know not what you do.
I forgive you, Your Highness, for you know not what you do.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Kraus?
He behaves as if he plans staying here for another century.
'Wait for it' is engraved on his skull.
How are you, Jakob? Are you all right?
Have you settled in?
Of course, Fräulein. Thank you.
And you get on with the other students?
I respect them all without exception.
And yet you quarrel with Kraus, no?
Listen to me, Jakob.
God gives a Kraus to this world in order to entrust it with a deep and insoluble riddle.
This riddle will never be understood because there isn't a single person alive...
..who will guess that there is some delicate meaning...
..behind this name, this...
..monosyllabic, inconspicuous Kraus.
No-one will ever be grateful to Kraus, nor is gratitude necessary.
Kraus will never go to ruin because there will always be great and loveless difficulties confronting him.
I think that I...
I am perhaps the only person who realises what we have in Kraus.
Or have had in him.
Slaap soet.
The way they live here with us students...
Are these the inner chambers?
Will I ever reach them?
Nameless...
..monosyllabic...
..inconspicuous...
..Kraus.
Tell me, don't you find life here...
..sterile?
Sterile, huh?
My mind is dying.
Forgive me for speaking so...
..intimately...
..for being so weak.
You are probably secretly laughing at me.
But watch out!
See that wall?
I could throw you against it so hard, you would never see or hear anything again.
But don't be afraid.
I couldn't hurt you.
It's so nice to talk with you.
Like we are almost related.
The way you speak... your gestures...
..your mouth...
..everything.
It's delightful to behave in that... rather weak sort of way with you.
Just think... me... your master...
..confessing to you.
My pathetic little worm...
..whom I could utterly crush... if I chose to.
Give me your hand.
Good.
I have to tell you... you've gained my respect...
..and now...
..I have a request.
Would you...?
Will you be my confidante?
Someone to share all of my secrets.
I'm asking you...Jakob.
But you may have time to think it over.
Please. Go.
Go now, Jakob.
It's time.
Kwart oor drie.
The same thing.
Over and over again.
Glaub mir, Lisa. Wirklich.
The moment I clapped my eyes on this figure,
I realised it was Jesus...
..as large as life, standing in front of me.
So...he wasn't dead.
He was right there before me in the snow...
..tenderly...beckoning to me.
And with his celestial but shy eyes all aglow, full of wondrous...
..terrible light.
I threw my entire being into the apparition.
And I asked myself, 'What's Jesus up to, here, on the edge of the city?
Is there really anything for him to do in this world, to concern himself with?
And if yes, what would be the most likely way he'd choose to...
..make himself known to us?'
And what do you think...
And a nice, big zero for you.
Look.
The sun.
Our plant.
How beautiful!
Johannes, it's 1:15.
It always strikes our planet at this time.
- Plant, I said.
- Yes, planet.
Why are there no longer any real seasons here?
Johannes, we never speak any more.
Lisa...
People... who know each other as well as we do...
..don't need to make small talk.
Who know each other as well as we do?
Brother and sister, I mean.
Snow White...
..waiting for life to stir her.
Lisa...
Lisa?
Dead.
To be nothing more than dead and smiling.
How I hurt beneath this sun.
I, who have never known the hot gusts of life.
Lisa...
Lisa...
I hadn't heard the Fräulein come in.
She laid her hand on my shoulder, as if she were weary and needed support.
I almost felt as though I belonged to her then.
Come with me, Jakob.
I want to show you something.
Oh, how beautiful it is here, Jakob. lf only you could see it.
But you mustn't.
That is not for you.
But you may feel.
The ice, Jakob.
How it waits.
How patiently it waits and grows.
Kiss it, Jakob.
Kiss the ice.
It is I, your teacher, Lisa Benjamenta, who asks you.
Don't let it steal your breath away!
That taste is your blood.
Come away.
There is warmth, Jakob.
You can find warmth.
Look for it, Jakob.
Look for it.
Is your heart on fire? Yes.
It burns.
But can it hold back the ice?
It's still there, Jakob. The ice.
It's still waiting.
I can't feel you, Jakob!
I can't feel you.
Suddenly, I was back, sitting at my desk.
Fräulein Benjamenta was still standing behind me.
She stroked my cheeks.
But it was as if she were comforting herself, not me.
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Yours, so shyly.
So shyly.
Yours...
My young saplings...sap... lf only...
I could be with...
..my dwarves.
My young saplings.
Saplings.
If only I could be with...saplings...
Paying attention...you're not...
Saplings...pay attention...
My young saplings.
Saplings.
My young saplings...
You're not paying attention.
I refer you to your manual.
The chapter headed The Divine Duty of Servants.
The section entitled...
Snares and Temptations...
..which is...
Can you hear me?
..which is...
Repeat after me.
Sobering, succinct...
..salutary advice...
..for those about to commit the sin of thinking themselves above their station.
This phenomenon is known as...
Pepino!
Hebling...
Inigo...
Inigo! Inigo!
Inigo!
This phenomenon is known as...
How everything is changing here.
No new students are enrolling at the institute.
Everything has become so...
..fragile.
Often the Fräulein stares out of the window, as if she were already living somewhere else.
Yet the lessons continue.
We're still caught in the grip of the rules and indulge in monotonous repetitions.
I've finally been inside the inner chambers...
..and I have to say...
..they don't exist.
Instead of a mystery, there's only a goldfish.
And Kraus has taught me how to clean out its bowl...
..change its water...
..and feed it.
Fräulein Lisa said something very strange to me.
'Jakob,' she said...
Jakob...
This must be for your ears only.
Something is gnawing at me.
Like this.
See how I am breathing on you?
That is how he's breathing his cold breath on me...
..from behind.
I'm sinking...
My breath is being crushed from me.
I am dying from...
..those who could have seen and held me.
I'm dying from...
..the emptiness of cautious and clever people.
Enough.
Now you must forget about all of this.
No-one must know.
Especially not my brother.
To be allowed to obey her...
As long as I obey her, she will live.
Whatever is forbidden lives...
..a hundred times over.
Herr Benjamenta...
Jakob von Gunten here.
You summoned me?
..or something very... delicate.
You see, Jakob... how I know the words by heart?
Because... it is my heart that speaks them.
Jakob...
Couldn't we...
Could we try, you and l...
The low and the mighty.
Could we just try to stand up to life together?
Shoulder to shoulder.
Side by side.
But Herr Benjamenta...
You are my principal.
This place is finished. Don't you understand?
I'm not accepting any more students. You were the last one.
You thought...
..the...Institut Benjamenta...
..was one of those places here today... and gone tomorrow?
It's you.
You are the one.
It's...all happened since you came.
Who are you?
Oh, Jesus...
Goodbye, Jakob.
Kiss me, Jakob.
Just once.
Be soft.
Shhh-shhh.
Enough.
No despair.
Everything is good just the way it is.
It's beautiful, isn't it...
..not to want anything any more?
From now on, it can only be evening in this world.
And all about me. lmagine me...coming for you.
Surely... the King is dead.
Twice over.
Jakob...
Jakob, I'm so...lonely.
Herr Benjamenta...
Sleep. Rest sweetly, dear Fräulein.
The Fräulein lay there lifeless, just as she told me she would.
Her eyes were still open. Not very wide...
..but as if she was still smiling.
And it seemed to me that she must live for eternity...
..only to be for eternity no living being.
The sound of thy voice shall live on.
We withdrew, leaving the brother with the sister.
The Principal with the Principaless.
The lonely man with the lonely woman.
The living person with the dead one.
I shall surely go on living, but what will become of you?
Do something.
Look behind the curtain...Jakob.
Look behind the curtain.
She may be hiding here.
Once...
..I was crowned with success.
The world smiled on me.
But I hated the world.
Hated existing.
Hated those I taught to take orders.
Hated myself for loving to give orders.
Everything.
I hated it all.
But no longer.
Now...
..that I'm not a king...
Now...
..I want to live.
I'm hungry for life!
Jakob...
Everyone has gone. Even Kraus.
I've pronounced the institute dead.
We are free.
Jakob...
Come with me.
Follow me...
..out of this world...
..for ever.
And it will snow upon us so intensely...
..in such immense silence.
Neither beginning nor end.
Everything in a grey, white...snowing.
No more sky.
No more air.
In us the sound of thy voice shall live on.
Eat me.

Schecky's very ugly.
When I speak to him,
I want to vomit.
I was in the elevator with him the other day, and there was a... a foul smell.
He has great concepts about life...
But I wouldn't want him to touch me.
Hey, there.
I'm schecky moskowitz.
Thank you.
See you later there,
Mr. cab driver.
Hey, how are ya?
Well, what you're about to see is a fictitious, loosely thrown together story about a sea cruise waiter...
Me, right here...
Who dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian.
This story is based entirely around the fact that we had access to this nice big boat here and a lot of good-looking women...
I mean, really good-looking women...
Beauty pageant girls.
Beautiful.
Hi.
Hola.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
G'day.
Unbelievable.
Beautiful.
Very clean women.
[Humming]
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I wanted to tell you um, this is a no, um, budget flick, not a low-budget flick.
No budget.
Um, just like...
This would be an earthquake right here.
[Rumbling]
See, that didn't cost us anything right there.
Now, enjoy the flick.
I'll see you later.
Man: All ashore that's going ashore.
Oh. All right.
Here we are on the deck ready to rock 'n' roll.
Start the picture.
I'm here in my waiter suit right now, and... oh, shoot.
I'll be right back.
[Horn blows]
Ah ha ha. Now that's better, right here.
Hey, waiter.
Where's my bloody Mary?
Ah, yes.
And make it bloody.
Ah. Yes, sir.
Hey, asshole.
Bring me another one.
Ah. Yes, ma'am.
[Man laughing]
I'll tell ya,
I just went out with a girl last week.
I was goin' crazy.
We were doin' good.
She's goin' crazy.
She's bitin' my nipples.
She's pullin' my chest hair, right?
Aw. Crazy, right?
Finally, I go, "hey.
This has gotta stop."
I said, hey, mom."
[Women laugh]
Man: All right. All right.
All right. All right.
Lemme tell you this one.
All right?
Last Wednesday, right?
I'm over this guy's house, right?
We're playing chess.
You know, a game of chess.
Finally, I says, "hey..."
"This shit's boring the shit outta me," right?
So, I took the chess piece, and I shoved it in his eye.
I shoved it in his eye.
And I said, "there's fuckin' chess-eye for ya."
You know what I'm sayin'?
[Man laughs]
You know what I'm sayin', right?
You know what
I'm sayin', right?
Check this out.
I went swimming on a boat the other morning, right?
And I go out swimming, and my dick shrivels up.
Jesus Christ!
You kidding?
My public hair had my penis hostage!
You know what I'm sayin'?
[Laughs]
You know what
I'm sayin', right?
Schecky!
Oh. Hi, Bob.
What are you doing?
I'm just listening to that guy over there.
Bob: The guy with the girls drooling all over him?
Schecky: Yeah.
Dickie diamond.
That's the ship comedian.
Oh. I guess that means you didn't convince the captain to hire you as ship comedian.
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess that's what
"get outta my office you no talent loser" meant.
No. I didn't get the job.
Tough break.
Well, I'm funnier than that guy, don't you think?
I don't know. I haven't heard him. Wait.
I got this chick, right?
She's... Got a scissor...
Like a fuckin' wrestler or something, right...
She's got a scissor hold on my neck, right?
I'm chokin',
I'm fuckin' dying.
Finally, I said,
"hey, grandma," take your fuckin' varicose sticks off my neck, will ya?
[Laughs]
Oh. That guy's pretty funny, scheck.
Oh, man. The guy's talking about incest.
That's not funny.
The guy needs help.
I could get laughs with that.
The guy probably farts onstage, too.
Hey. Pull my finger.
Pull my finger.
Pfft.
[Laughs]
[Farting sounds and laughing]
All my life, I just wanted to get onstage and make people laugh, but nobody gives me a chance around here.
I'm funny. I mean,
I just want them to hear what I gotta say.
I got certain things
I wanna talk about.
Maybe they'd be interested in hearing, you know?
Man: Waiter guy!
My wife's throwin' up!
Quick. Get me a towel!
Sorry. I'm on break.
Hey! Hey! How are ya?
I didn't see ya there.
Um, well, let's see.
What happened? Where were we?
After I finished cleaning up that lady's vomit, um, I worked a few more hours and then I took a little break, and during that break
I wrote a few new jokes, and I think they're pretty good.
I'm very happy with myself right now.
See, what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna ask the big comedian,
Dickie diamond, if I can open up for him...
[knocking on door]
Whoa. What, you hear that?
I bet that's my best friend, Bob.
Hey, schecky.
Hey.
Who you talkin' to?
I been talkin' to that camera right there.
Oh. So, you ready for work?
I am ready for work, but I was wonderin' before we go, you think I could just run a few things by you, a few jokes... just, like, a little improvisation?
You give me your honest opinion, all right?
No problem.
Whoo-hoo.
I'm all audience.
All right. Here we go, then.
All right. Hey.
How you guys doin' out there tonight?
Fine.
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
What's your name, pal?
Where you from?
Bob from California.
Bob from California?
Whoa!
Bob from California.
Bob.
[Laughs]
Bob from California!
Whoo!
Bob: Yeah.
I can't think of anything funny.
Was that part of your act?
No. I... jeez. I stink at this.
I'm not funny.
Not true. I think you're very funny.
I think you're funny naturally.
As soon as you get up onstage, people are gonna laugh.
Are you ever gonna get on a stage?
Hopefully, because I'm gonna ask
Mr. Dickie diamond if I can open up for him one of these nights.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh. We better get outta here,
'cause Dickie diamond's doin' his afternoon set on the deck.
So, let's go and check that out.
Right.
[Claps]
I'll tell you. Sometimes, it gets really, really hot, you know, in L.A. nothing moves on your whole body.
The only thing that you can possibly move is your middle finger.
That's it.
[All laugh]
Fuck you!
That's all you can do.
Hey, buddy. Right there.
Right there.
I mean, I'm sorry.
Sometimes, it gets so hot you're just drivin' in your car, and you're... you're in a human microwave now.
You're in your car, you're flippin' off everybody, right?
You're just pissed off, flippin'.
If this was a knife,
I'd poke you right in the eye, buddy, you know?
I'm drivin', I'm...
Finally, that's it.
I'm way too hot now, right?
I said, "I'm goin' to get something to drink."
I go. I get a 6-pack.
I'm drinkin'.
I'm drivin', right?
Cop pulls me over.
He says, "are you drinkin'?"
Of course,
I'm fuckin' drinkin'.
What kind of question is that?
It's fuckin' hot.
[Laughs]
Hey. What's your name?
Bunny Miller.
Bunny Miller.
Is that a Jewish name?
Boy. A nice Jewish name like that.
So, where'd your mother pop you out?
What?
[Laughs]
Where'd you burst your bag, bunny? Come on.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry.
Bunny, come on, it's not a fucking genius question here.
[Laughs]
[Buzzer sound] You lose, bun.
Guess what? You lose.
You know what happens to losers?
You get your bathing suit ripped off and shoved up your ass.
[Laughs]
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you just...
Leave the girl alone and stick to your comedy?
Oh-oh. Mr. heckler.
Mr. big man from hell.
The hell heckler is here, folks.
Oh, my God. Look.
He's so big.
All I'm sayin' is why don't you just lay off the girl?
Lay the girl?
That's a sick thing, man.
That's a sick thing.
Right in front of all these people to lay the girl?
That's really a sick thing.
[Laughs]
Ok, fine.
I'm just gonna have to shoot you.
[Laughs]
Oh. Oh.
[Applause]
[Humming]
I tell you.
There's nothing heavier than a dead comedian.
[All laugh]
Schecky: Thank you.
Um, I was talking to my father the other day on the phone, and he said to me,
"schecky"...
Um, he calls me "schecky"
'cause that's my name, and I don't answer to "Bob" much. Baa.
He said, "uh, schecky",
"I want you to marry a girl with the same belief as the family," and I was kinda, like,
"uh, dad, why should
I marry a girl who thinks I'm a shmuck?"
Huh? Hey. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right. Well, my name is, uh, schecky, and my father's name is schecky, also.
Having a name as your father, the same name, that's...
That's very weird, you know?
It was all right till my voice changed.
My friends would call up and say,
"hi. Is schecky there?"
My father would say,
"this is schecky."
My friends would say,
"hey, schecky.
You were so wasted last night."
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
All right. Now, look.
Look, look, look, look.
On your last tour, we sold at least a million croaker t-shirts...
A million of 'em.
So we did 100,000 on the croaker spiked arm bracelets, but I still think it would be in your best interest to approve...
Approve the... the...
The action doll for your younger audience, for the 9-year-olds, the 10-year-olds and... and such forth.
Yeah, but I don't want to be no fuckin'
Barbie doll, mort.
That can't be good for my image, man.
No. Croakie, come on.
Listen to me, man.
Listen to me, baby.
You listening?
I'm listenin'.
Ok, 'cause it doesn't look like you're listening to me.
What do I gotta do?
Shove my fuckin' ear against your mouth?
All right, croakie.
Just listen to me.
We need the doll.
Last April, you trashed 4 porsches and one harley Davidson.
The hotel that you burned down is suing us.
They're suing us.
We need the doll.
We need it.
Why not a poster?
Why not a lunchbox or somethin'?
Why does it have to be a Barbie?
It's not a Barbie doll...
It's a fucking action figure, croaker!
An action figure!
It's like a...
Like a Rambo doll or like one of those, um...
Those... those transformer things you're so nuts about.
It's... it's an action figure.
It's macho. It's macho, croakie, macho.
Croaker,
I talked to Saul.
Saul says we can make
40 million off of it.
40 million?
40 million.
4-d million?
40 million.
Action figure, huh?
Yeah.
That's cool, man.
That's cool...
But make sure it ain't smilin'.
Yes! All right now, waiter!
Ah. You see, these guys have nothin' to do with this flick, but we threw 'em in just for a little variety...
Whatever that means, huh?
May I help you guys?
Yeah. Drinks all around, man.
Bambi, what can I get for you to drink?
Um, actually, I have an aerobics class, so, um, I'm gonna take a rain man on that.
Oh, God! I mean, a rain check.
No problem, babe.
Man, oh, man.
I never get sick of that, man.
Can I, uh, get you a drink?
Yeah. Get me one of them, uh, tropical drinks with, like, uh, levels to them and an umbrella and fruit.
Oh. Well, um, they come in 2 flavors.
You can have 'em green or black.
Black.
And can
I get you one?
Huh?
A drink?
Yeah... yeah.
What... whatever.
Say, you know,
I used to work uh, as a waiter once...
Back before I was a multi-billionaire.
Mort: Millionaire, croaker.
Millionaire, baby.
Millionaire.
It was at one of these rib restaurants, man, and, uh, I... it was, like, I'd have to touch all these people's chewed up food, and it would get stuck underneath my fingernails, man, and it would just sit there for days and it would stink.
I hated that job, man.
Both: Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Can we please have your autograph?
Please?
All right!
Yo! Chicks, man.
Mmm. I'll sign autographs for you bitches, man.
Just say, "to Pammy and Liz", you were great last night.
Love, croaker."
All right!
Hey, mort. Mort.
How do you spell...
How do you spell
"great," man?
G-r-e-a-t.
All right.
Thank you.
You, uh... you in a band or somethin'?
Yeah, man. I'm the lead singer for yellow teeth.
We had the number one song last week,
I wanna slap your cat.
* I wanna slap your cat *
* that's where it's at
I'll go get you that drink, all right?
All right.
Ok.
Whoa. That guy's punked in the head right there.
I... i just don't understand it.
Why do sleazy guys like that get chicks?
Just 'cause they get millions and millions of dollars?
It makes me sick.
If I had a million dollars...
Actually, I would take a hundred and bury it and hopefully, somebody poor would find it.
If I had a million dollars...
I would buy another fur coat.
Spend it on clothes.
Put it in the bank and think about it.
I'd put it in the bank.
If I had a million dollars, the first thing I'd buy would be a Mercedes.
I would buy out clearasil so I could pop everybody's pimples because they wouldn't be able to get rid of them.
Mmm. Pus.

Um, well, I got off work a little early tonight, so, I figured
I'd hang out at the bar with my good friend
Bob, here.
Um, what these guys are doin' here,
I really have no idea, but I... i really can't know everything, now, can I?
I just finished up tellin' Bob this joke about a farmer.
Let's see how he reacts to it, all right?
I don't get it, schecky.
I... the farmer wears the condom for 8 years.
Explain it to me.
[Clears throat]
I don't know, and I can't explain it to you.
I guess I must have told the joke wrong or something.
Ah.
Ha ha.
I got it, man.
I thought that joke was really funny.
Really?
Yeah.
[Laughs]
Hey. Did I ever tell you that I used to be a waiter once?
You were?
Yeah. It was at this restaurant, man...
And I hated that job, man, because I had to touch all these people's chewed up food.
Do you know what I would do?
What?
I would go into the bathroom during my shift, and I'd do a number 2...
Yeah?
And I wouldn't wash my hands, man.
[Laughs]
I think that's illegal, man.
[Laughs]
Hi, croaker.
Hey, babe.
Hey. Who's the other babe?
This is my friend, bluebell
I brought along for your friend, mort, like you told me to.
All right.
Jesus Christ, croakie.
What are you... you...
You paying chicks to be with me again?
Is that what you're doin'?
You think
I don't know that you pay 'em to sleep with me?
I'm not payin' anybody, man.
She wants you.
Check it out.
Ok. This is the guy
I have to sleep with...
To get to croaker?
Unh.
Ok. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Well, this is great.
This is great.
Rock on, man.
Rock 'n' roll.
[Laughs]
Hey, hey.
Hey, is somethin' wrong?
Ah. No.
Ah. Come on.
Ah. Well, yeah.
Well, somethin' a little, I guess.
Um...
Women don't like me, and I'm not funny.
That's not true.
You're very funny.
Well, yeah, maybe.
I'm... I'm definitely still gonna ask
Dickie diamond if I can open up for him.
Bob?
Yeah?
Am I at all good-looking?
Yeah. Yeah.
You look fine.
Well, seriously,
I mean, who do you think is better looking, me or you?
[Laughs]
Well, that's easy.
I mean, me.
[Sighs]
I've been watching you, waiter boy.
Your name is Bob, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
It's Bob.
I think we should go look at the moon together, don't you?
Yes, I do.
I think that's a very, very, very good idea.
See ya later, schecky.
Uh, hi.
What the hell do you mean by that?
I just mean "hi".
I can't believe it.
Can't a girl come into a bar and have some peace?
Oh. All I said was "hi".
[Sighs]
Yeah? Well, fuck you.
Hey, beertender.
Gimme a brew, will ya?
[Farts]
Hey. You're... you're
Dickie diamond.
You're the ship comedian.
Yeah. That's me.
Dickie diamond.
Hey, man. I know who you are.
You're that psycho waiter that keeps watching me from the audience.
Oh, yeah.
I am a waiter here, but, um, actually, um,
I'm a stand-up comedian, too.
I do stand-up. Yeah.
I'm just being a waiter here until I...
I'm not gettin' stage time quite yet.
That's great, kid.
What the hell are you tellin' me for?
Well, I was just wonderin'...
Maybe, um, I could open up for you just one night here.
[Laughs]
Open up for Dickie diamond, huh?
[Laughs]
Kid, what do you think this is?
The fucking tonight show?
It's a boat.
Yeah. I know.
I know that.
I was just wondering...
Well, all I'm saying is maybe I could...
Let me... let me just, uh, tell you a few of my jokes.
I'll tell you a few of my jokes.
Maybe... i don't know... listen.
Um, all right.
There's this fat old lady, and she walks into this bar, and she's coughing.
[Coughs]
She's really coughing loud, and she doesn't...
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, kid.
You know, you're probably a really, really funny guy, you know?
I can tell just by the way you're telling it you probably are.
But you know what?
I just came down here to wait for my girlfriend, to have a beer, relax a little bit, not sit at the bar and hear some dumb ass comic tell me some stupid, fucking jokes, all right?
Oh, man. I wasn't trying to...
Uh, I know that...
I just was wondering if I could...
All I'm asking for is maybe I could go up one night, you know?
You're... you're...
Just go up and open up for you.
It's not a big deal.
Listen, kid,
I... i don't care.
I don't care what you're saying. You get that?
I don't care.
I don't give a flying fuck what you're saying.
All right? Great.
Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're sayin'.
I... I'm sorry if I'm buggin' you, but all I wanted to do...
I mean, I work on the ship, too.
I was wondering if you could just let me go up for a few minutes.
Kid, I don't care.
I'm not tryin' to ask anything that big of a deal.
All I want to do is just maybe open up for you.
I mean, I'm not...
I don't care!
Hey.
Hi, Dickie.
Where were you, baby?
In the bathroom, thinking of you.
Oh, that's cute.
Come on.
Why don't you give
Mr. giggles a little kiss?
Not in front of that pervert.
Did this guy say something to you?
Nah. He just tried to pick up on me big time.
Stand back.
Did you say something to my girlfriend?
No, man. I...
I think you did, man.
Oof!
There's your punch line, you stupid fuck.
Oh, man.
That guy is un-cool.
You know what they say...
Behind the mask of a clown lies a trail of tears.
Wow. My jaw is killin' me.
Schecky...
Why don't you just go home and go to bed?
Yeah. All right.
I'll just go home and go to bed alone.
Again.
I can't go to sleep.
I'm too depressed.
I wonder where
I'll be in, like, in, like, 10 years.
In 10 years from now,
I will be a TV broadcaster on a television station.
I will be married and have 2 children.
I hope to be firmly established in my career, possibly married and with 2 children.
Several children would be nice and just a happy home life.
I'll probably be a bagel vendor or something.
I know what will cheer me up!
Meditation!
I'll just go meditate until the sun rises.
Ohm. Ohm.
Ohm.
Ohm.
Aw, man!
I can't get women.
I can't get laughs.
I'm not even a good waiter.
This sucks.
I'm so depressed.
I think I'm going to just escape reality right now and go to sleep.
[Snickering]
Schecky, or should I say, porky?
[Rim shot]
[Laughing]
Aw, scheck, you got an apple in your mouth.
Where's William tell when you need him?
Look at you.
You look just like your sister, a pig.
[Laughing]
You wearing a straightjacket? Oh!
In your case it might be a homojacket.
You're a loser, scheck a loser.
[Laughing]
You're a loser.
[Laughs]
You're a loser, scheck.
[Laughs]
Hey, scheck, here's my closing bit.
[Grunting and moaning]
Aah!
Oh, boy, that dream sucked.
I'm going to go to sleep again.
And this time, it's going to be better.
* ooh, ooh
* each day through my window *
* I watch her as she passes by *
* I say to myself
* you're such a lucky guy *
* to have a girl like her *
* is truly a dream come true *
* out of all the fellas in the world *
* she belongs to me
* but it was just my imagination *
* running away with me
* it was just my imagination *
* running away with me
* ohh, ohh
* soon we'll be married
* and raise a family... * mommy!
What the hell are you doing, schecky?
Are you trying to kill me?
Who are these girls?
I knew you were suicidal.
I knew it.
You're going to die from this, schecky.
Your weeny's going to fall off just like your father's.
Do you hear me, schecky?
It felt so great.
Her breasts were like baseballs.
They were hard and firm, and they stuck out like torpedoes.
Schecky. Schecky. Schecky.
Schecky. Schecky!
Schecky! Schecky.
Oh, you should have seen her.
My God, it was unbelievable.
I mean, she was begging for me.
She loved me.
Talk about luck.
I mean, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
Did I ever tell you you look just like my mother?
No.
You really do. Whoa!
What time is it?
It's time for work.
Hey, I didn't know you slept in your uniform.
Oh, yeah.
Anyway, she told me her name was debbi with an "I", and she did a spread for hustl magazine.
Ooh, debbi with an "I"?
Uh, did she do, like, a 7-page spread with a pig?
I saw that.
Wow.
Well, all right.
You see, there's this girl
I met, right?
And anything that girl tells me, I do.
For example,
I asked her on a scale of 1 to 10, what am I?
And she said,
"you're an 8," so I peed on her shoes.
Ur-in-ate.
I don't know.
Maybe you should avoid telling actual jokes and just stick to improvising and talking with the audience.
I thought it was funny.
Yeah?
A lot funnier than that jerk they hired as the ship's comedian.
You actually thought that joke was funny?
Let me put it this way.
He's funny.
The other guy's a hack.
Yeah.
I am funny.
He really is a hack, isn't he?
Yeah.
[Rocky theme plays]
I don't want any cheap shots.
I don't want any hitting below the waist.
I don't want any food or drink on the mat.
That's a new one.
And may the best man win.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ok. All right.
Let's go, brillo-head.
Look at you.
You got more teeth than a fucking saw.
[Boing]
Look at your mouth.
What are doing, stunt work for Mr. ed?
[Boing]
Hey, those are nice legs you got there.
I saw them the other night.
I was in a Japanese restaurant.
Yeah, I used them to pick up my Sushi.
Oh! Uhh!
Ref, come on.
That was below the belt.
I didn't see anything.
Ahh! Ooh, you're a winner, baby.
You're always thinking, and I like that.
What, is that black hat on there to show respect to your dead brain?
Oh, jeez,
I like that, sasquatch.
Got enough hair on your back?
You want me to braid it for ya?
Oh, look it's speedo bandito there. I like that.
Huh, what are smuggling in a half a roll of certs?
Ha ha. Oh, by the way,
I do weddings, in case your parents decide on getting married.
What's that around your neck?
Your mother's leash?
Man:
You buffoon.
Ooh, hoo hoo hoo.
[Birds chirping]
[Crowd cheers]
Hey! Schecky!
Snap out of it.
You looked like you were fantasizing about killing Dickie diamond or something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We better go serve these drinks, Bob.
Oh, right.
Miss Australia:
Politics are, like, really weird.
I mean, they're, like,
I never think about them unless somebody says,
"what do you think about politics," you know?
But I think world leaders are real important to the future of the world.
World peace would be nice, but would be nicer, would be...
Everyone would get whatever they wish for.
In life.
We can all work as one, then that's when world peace will come around.
Oh, Panama.
Oh, general noriega.
I think he should be killed for killing people who vote against him.
Well, I think he should see a dermatologist, you know?
I can tell by just looking at general noriega that he has a really icky, rancid breath that's so bad that when he's talking to you, you have to hold your own breath to keep from gagging.
See, I have this really strong sense of smell.
He has a...
Probably, you know, doesn't use any form of personal, you know, hygienic protection, you know, deodorant.
I think he probably...
He has stinky armpits, as well. Um, probably...
You know, if you, like, put a pizza in...
If you don't eat a pizza and you put it in the fridge for, like, you know, couple of days, well, maybe like 10 days, and you got it out and you left it out for a couple of hours and then you went back and wanted to take a bite?
And it's that smell that you get just before you, like, put it in your mouth.
I think it's probably a bit like what he smells like.
I just wouldn't want to spend any real time with the man.
In fact, I rather spend a whole day with Ted Bundy...
Huh! I smell?
Bad breath?
Eh? We see who gets the last laugh here, you leftover, worthless kangaroo vomit.
Ohh!
See that woman?
Where?
No, idiot, on the TV there.
That woman there?
That woman on the TV there?
That woman on the TV.
I want her killed.
Her name is miss Australia.
She said I smelled like pizza.
No! Like a pizza?
A pizza.
What kind of pizzas?
An old pizza.
[Sniffs]
Um, an old, uh, cheese pizza?
With, uh, anchovies?
[Gunshot]
And, um, uh, what kind of crust?
I want her killed.
What does that matter?
Uh, round, uh pizza?
It don't matter.
Kill miss Australia.
You want us to kill the woman on the videoscreen?
That woman on the videotape, yes.
Um, you want us to kill that girl there in the videotape that you rented?
We going to kill her?
That girl in there now in the tape that you rented killed.
Sí.
Where is she?
She's in the store with the videotapes?
You, you listen to me, huh?
Huh? I say lick toilet, you lick toilet.
I say pick the nose, you pick the nose.
I say kill videotape girl, you kill videotape girl.
Huh?
Oh, yes, sir!
She's dead.
We, we kill miss Australia.
We going, um, um, we going to kill crocodile dundee.
She's dead.
Dog meat dead, sir.
She is, um, a deader than a koala on the freeway way, sir.
She's deader than shrimps on the Barbie.
Dead as a koala bear.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You 2 comedians?
[Mumbling]
Go! Go! Go kill miss Australia.
Get out!
* he goes into the room *
* everybody runs and hides *
* he never be a groom
* he never catch a bride *
* it's a sad, sad world *
* when your head looks like a pizza *
* but it's sadder, sadder still *
* when no girl wants to meet ya * miss Australia: Well,
I'll bet his best friends don't even want to talk to him.
You know,
I... i think he stinks.
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey! Hey!
Now, schecky, fighting isn't going to solve anything.
Shut up, Bob.
[Grumbling]
Son of a bitchin' boat's rocking my goddamn head off for Christ's sake.
[Foghorn]
Ow! Oh!
Oh! Fucking...
[Foghorn]
Oh, fuck you.
Fucking bullhorn out of nowhere, for Christ's sake.
Fuck, bullshit, bull... oh... horn. Shit.
Fucking playing...
Feel like I'm doing the polka, for Christ's sake.
Just... oh, oh.
Christ, more stairs than fucking notre dame.
Jesus Christ.
Hi, Dickie.
I just had the greatest interview.
I spoke all about my political beliefs and I said what you told me to about general noriega.
Oh, that's fucking great, Ellen.
That's wonderful.
Listen.
Why don't you just do me a favor, ok?
Take off for a while.
I need some space. Ok, honey?
Sure, no problem.
I'm going to go and get a pastrami sandwich.
[Stomach roils]
Fucking pastrami sandwich.
She knows fucking
Dickie diamond hates pastrami sandwiches.
Oh, shit. Ocean.
Uhh! Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Fuck you!
Fuck. Fuck. Uhh!
Fuck that. You got...
I'm walking away from this.
I'm fucking walking away from this.
You got nothing. Hah!
[Stomach roils]
Fuck!
Fuck that.
Son of a bitch.
My best hat!
Ohh! Ohh!
Fucking stairs. Great!
More fucking stairs.
Fuck.
Oh! Porcelain goddess.
Uhh! Here I come.
Aah!
Dickie!
Aah! Oh, my God!
Dickie!
Help!
Man overboard!
My God!
Man overboard!
Help! Dickie!
Dickie diamond doesn't throw up.
My agent's fucking fired.
He's out.
Hey.
Hey! Open the fucking door!
Aw, shit!
Aw, fuck!
Hey! Hey!
Aw, come on, somebody open...
Where's a fucking maid when you need one?
Open the fu...
Aw, fuck.
Fuck. Oh, shit.
Richard "Dickie"
Scott Brian David diamond steinwitz.
He was such a funny man.
A man who made us laugh.
A man who brightened our hearts and opened up our every day with endless possibilities of laughter.
The guy talked about banging his grandmother.
What is this?
Let's us pray.
Let us look at our books...
Psalm 29, Jackson 5.
Red Sox 4, Yankees 3 in the bottom of the eighth.
God! Is that a porpoise out there?
[Speaking hebrew]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Let us pray that
Richard "Dickie" Scott diamond steinwitzman is in heaven entertaining the angels in that great microphone of the sky.
What are we going to do?
Who's going to make us laugh the rest of the cruise?
I mean, who's going to brighten our days and open our hearts now?
Who?
Whoa, man! This is my big chance here.
If I volunteer,
I'm going to be the ship's comedian.
Aw, that'd be great.
But if I don't,
I'm just going to be schecky the schmuck waiter the rest of my life, and I'll never touch a woman again and I just... i got to touch a woman.
I just want to grab her.
I just want to...
Oh, God that would be good.
But I... but I can't do it.
I just can't do it.
I don't know.
I'm too crazy.
I'm nervous.
I bet... i mean,
I'm probably the one who killed
Dickie diamond.
I was so jealous of that guy.
I just... I'm not going to do it.
I won't do it.
There's no...
I can't do it.
There's no way
I'm going to...
Holy cow!
Who are you?
Schecky!
I am king Neptune,
God of the sea.
I couldn't help overhearing what you were thinking.
Not that I eavesdrop or anything, but I couldn't help hearing you were, uh, well, that you wanted to be the ship comedian.
Ha ha. But you have doubts, my son.
Doubts that you shouldn't have.
Wait. Am I hallucinating here?
Are you for real or what?
Sure as that big nose on the end of your face.
Ahh, jeez.
An anti-semitic fish.
You're definitely not a giflte fish, I guess?
Listen!
You got to have a sense of humor to be king of that cesspool,
Sonny.
Su toilet is mi casa, ¿comprende?
Don't tell me you're unworldly and you lack confidence, to boot.
Sheesh, it's a good thing
I felt it my duty to tell you to go for it!
Take the job as ship comedian.
These people need you.
Well, hey, hey!
They need me?
[Falsetto]
They need me?
Yes, they need you!
What are you fishing for compliments here?
Everyone needs to laugh.
May the gods be my witnesses
I've been at the brunt of a few too many jokes at the office water cooler, let me tell you!
Mismanagement they said! My tail!
I'll put a hex on exxon! [Sings]
I remember when I was the prince of...
Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I mean, is this going to be a big long story here?
We don't have time for that.
You know,
I got a responsibility.
There's a movie here, and, you know, they don't want to hear this.
So you understand, yeah?
You got a time thing?
Time issue?
We don't have time.
Well,
I just thought
I'd give you a little confidence.
You just go ahead,
Mr. sailorpants.
Why don't you just finish?
Oh, man.
No, really, king Neptune, thank you.
I appreciate it.
But remember...
The power of laughter!
I'll do it!
I'll do it!
I'll be ship comedian.
Ya... hooo!
Yeah!
[Singing in spanish]
Quit banging!
I'm not banging.
I'm drumming.
It's good for me.
Quit drumming!
Ok.
Um...
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Um, the big stinky man.
The big stinky man who?
The big stinky man is you!
Shut up, achmed, you're not funny.
I am funny.
I'm very funny.
Achmed is funny!
Oh, man, what happens if I go up there and I die a miserable death?
They're not gonna like me.
I'm gonna blank up there.
Someone's gonna throw food at me.
I'll be hit in the head with a meatloaf.
Schecky.
I'll get thrown overboard.
The shark's gonna rip my legs off.
Schecky!
Now, no one's gonna hate you as long as you act natural, but I think if we sang a little song right now, you'd feel a little better.
All right.
Ok.
* comedy, such a lovely lady *
* lady
* she'll pick you up
* pick you up
* when you're feelin' blue
* feelin' blue
* she'll run her fingers through your hair *
* your hair
* and make you feel that someone cares *
* someone cares
* about you
* about you, about you *
* skid skid-a-Lee doo
* skid-a-Lee doodle-Lee doodle-Lee doo * now, don't you feel better?
I do. I do.
Ok. Now, you don't have to try to be funny.
Just be yourself.
You don't have to tell jokes.
Hey, you're right.
I'll just talk to 'em.
I'll just ask 'em questions about themselves, and that's it.
Right.
Now, that's good.
Now, fix your hair, wipe your eyebrows...
Oh. Got it.
Wipe your nose, smell your breath, check your armpits, tie your shoes...
I got dat.
And sit up straight.
Ahh!
Eh!
Holy shit.
Look at me.
I look like a fuckin' zombie.
You fuckin' sicko.
Holy shit.
All right.
All right.
That's it.
I'm fuckin' dyin' in here.
I'm gonna fuckin' shrivel up like a fuckin' piece of bacon.
Oh, boy. I am very nervous right now.
This is a frightening thing to do...
Take over for a dead comedian that everybody loved so much.
All right. Here it goes.
Here we go.
I'm gonna do it right now.
Hey, everybody.
How are you doin' tonight?
[Crowd groans and microphone screeches]
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
That's good.
Uh, you, sir. Hi.
Hi. What's your name?
Dave.
Dave. We got Dave here.
Dave. Hey, Dave.
What do you do for a living?
I'm a construction worker.
Dave's a construction worker, everybody.
See that? So, Dave, what do you construct?
I construct buildings.
What the fuck else would I construct?
Oh. Oh. That's good.
All right.
Well, so, Dave, do you think that constructing is an easy job, or do you think it's a hard job?
[Whispers]
You know what?
Listen, butthole.
Why don't you quit tryin' to be funny, because all you're doin' is pissin' me off.
Oh. Um, hey.
That kind of sounded like my ex-girlfriend right there. Ha ha!
Woman: You suck!
But she's a little bit bigger than Dave. Ha ha!
Man: Get off, big nose.
All I'm saying is,
I'm not very good with relationships.
Woman: Boring.
That's all I was trying to say right there. Ha ha!
Um, hi. How are you doing there? What's your name?
I hate you!
Oh, this isn't goin' too well, is it?
Well, why don't we just start over right now?
Man: Get off.
Just give me a chance.
I'm pretty funny.
Ok, look.
Here's a good joke.
Um, all right.
There's a proctologist, right? And he's...
We want Dickie.
We want Dickie.
We want Dickie.
We want Dickie.
We want Dickie.
Hey, hey, hey.
What do you want?
I mean, the guy is dead.
You want to hear a corpse or something?
You know what?
A corpse would be funnier than you are.
I want to hear croaker sing.
[Crowd cheering]
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Hey. All right.
Let's rock!
[Screaming]
[Rock music playing]
* well, I'm on the prowl out the cat door *
* 'cause I'm in love with a little girl, boy *
* hear her howl, lovely woman *
* serving me some hot, hot tuna *
* yeah
* I'm gonna slap your cat
* upside his head
* yeah
* I'm gonna slap your cat
* yeah, yeah
* meow
* well, I climb the walls over tail so fine *
* my furry paws want your behind *
* all come for love to me *
* I'm so wild and so in heat *
* yeah

* upside his head, yeah
* I'm gonna slap your cat, baby *
* yeah, yeah
* I'm gonna slap your cat
* yeah, yeah, yeah
* I'm gonna slap your cat
* yeah, yeah give me that jacket.
Give it here.
Give it up.
I failed, man.
I failed.
King Neptune was wrong.
Nobody needs me.
King Neptune?
Yeah, king Neptune.
He's God of the sea?
Oh, there he is, right over there.
Bob: Oh.
Schecky, uh, can I be honest with you?
Yeah, Bob. You can be honest with me.
Come on.
Let's take a walk.
Schecky,
I hate comedians.
Not all comedians, though.
Just 99% of them.
See, to me, stand-up comedy is such a sad thing.
I mean, it's so pathetic.
It's absolutely the most degrading thing a human being can put himself through, standing up on stage, alone, talking about how fat or how bald or how ugly you are.
I mean, spilling your guts about your family history and your alcoholic father, blatantly begging the audience to love you, to accept you, and give you the love that you never had as a child.
It's pathetic, schecky.
It's an empty, loveless...
Bob. Bob, what are you trying to say?
Let me put it this way.
Comedy is like this life preserver.
Ahh! Comedy is round with ropes hanging off of it. All right.
See, schecky, that wasn't funny.
I know you probably said that to make me laugh and to like you more, but you didn't have to, see?
I like you enough already.
Bob, stop, all right? Stop.
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop being a psychoanalyst and just...
You're too stupid to tell me anything, all right?
I like comedy.
I like being funny.
That's it.
All right?
Ok. Ok.
Then maybe you should try telling some jokes this time instead of just being yourself.
I mean, maybe that would work.
That is a great idea, Bob. Jokes.
You hit it right on the head, but first, let's see a montage of some beautiful women.
* doo doo doo doo doo doo *
* doo doo doo doo doo doo *
* ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
* doo doo doo doo doo doo *
* I met a gentle woman
* she took my heart away
* she said I had it comin' to me *
* that I wanted it that way *
* I think any lovin' is good lovin' *
* so I took what
I could get *
* yeah, I took what I could get *
* ooh, she looked at me with those big brown eyes *
* and said, you ain't seen nothin' yet *
* b-b-baby, you ain't seen nothin' yet *
* here's somethin'
* here's somethin' you'll never forget *
* baby, you ain't seen nothin' yet *
* you ain't been around now, honey * the meat, it's good.
And more.
I mean, it's...
It's a lot.
Perfect.
Your wife, she make that for you?
Yes.
Nice wife.
Uh-huh.
I don't have wife.
Your salami, it's very big.
Big enough for 2 peoples.
Big enough for 3 peoples.
There's enough there for whole family of peoples haven't eaten for whole weeks.
Cut me a little slice.
No.
Give me a little?
No.
Give me a little hunk!
No.
Why not?
Give me a little.
No.
Give me a little hunk!
No, no.
Son of a bitch.
Give me your salami.
[Arguing]
Is this the way generals wear them?
Yes. Sí.
Ha ha! This one goes up, over, and this one goes under?
Sí. One moves up, one... heh heh!
You know what my mother says about you?
Heh heh!
Ha ha!
She says you're an untrained animal.
Ha ha!
Heh heh!
But you should hear what my father says.
No, I... i can't.
No, no, no.
Go to the ship.
Heh heh!
Ha ha!
What is it,
Robinson crusoe?
What does your father say?
Oh, no, no.
My father doesn't... no.
I promised him, pinky swear.
He said
I couldn't tell.
Well, does he like me, or no?
Uh, he says he has to like you.
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
I don't think he voted for you, though.
Oh, well, we'll...
We forgive that.
Heh heh!
Ha ha!
I'll tell my father that.
That you'll let him out of jail.
Ha ha!
Heh heh!
Not yet.
Yes, I will.
Couple years.
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
A couple years?
Well, he's not that old.
Hoo hoo!
Ha ha!
Oh, you're terrible.
You are really bad.
No, no, no, no.
He's a good man.
In a couple years, he'll...
Couple years?
Well, yes.
He find philosophy.
For what?
He find philosophy in the can.
Ha ha!
Is that where you find it?
Sure. In the can.
You wear these fuckin' things?
Look at you.
Nice fuckin' patent leather fucker.
Ridiculous fuckin' shoes you're wearing.
You wearing these?
Nothin' good for that.
They're not even good for bangin' on the fuckin' door.
Hello.
I don't know. Maybe it is, maybe not.
I don't think it's grounds for legal action, croakie.
That's all I'm sayin'.
I don't think it is.
I don't care what it costs, man.
I want that guy sued, all right?
I'm singin' my song, and I made it very clear to that guy
I wanted to be shot from a higher angle.
He shoots me from straight on, it makes my nose look absolutely huge.
My fans are not gonna accept...
Dickie: Hey. Hey.
Hey, let me out.
It's Dickie diamond.
I'm in the fuckin' bathroom.
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Is that that...
Ooh, that's that guy.
That's the dead guy, the comedian.
Whoa, man, this is weird, because if he's dead...
If he's dead, how could he be screamin'?
I don't know, croakie.
Maybe it's his...
Maybe it's his ghost.
Dickie: Let me out.
Wait a minute, man.
You're scarin' me.
Yeah.
Don't scare me like that, man.
I can't take this ghost stuff.
How do I get off this boat?
[Dickie pounds]
Let me out, you fucks.
This ship is haunted, man.
Get me off this ship.
This ship is haunted.
I gotta get off this ship, man.
Croakie, listen to me.
Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen to me, croakie.
Let me out, you little fuck.
Croaker: Help me.
Help me get off this boat.
Help me. I gotta get out of here now.
No. No.
I gotta get out of here.
[Voices fade]
No. Motherfuckers.
These fuckin' fag socks you've been wearin'.
Look at this shit.
Oh, fuck.
[Sniffs] Shit.
That's twice as bad.
Maybe I can go out through there.
Fuck, it's a toilet.
Flush myself out.
Come on, somebody. Please?
Aha!
You cheated.
That's not cheating.
That's cheatin'.
Nn-nn.
Are you gonna wear that for your comedy act?
Oh, I was thinkin' of it. Yeah.
No. No.
I think you should wear your pink shirt.
Oh. Oh. Well, if I'm gonna change shirts,
I'll probably just wear my green shirt.
No, no, no. The pink shirt shows off your tan.
Oh.
It's a nice shirt.
Yeah, you're right, but I like green.
The green shirt would be better.
The pink is much better, much better.
No, I'm gonna...
See, green... luck is green.
No, no, no.
Pink. Pink.
I like green.
Pink.
Green is good.
Pink. Pink.
Green. Green is what I...
Pink.
Green.
Green. Green.
Pink. Pink.
Pink.
Green.
Why don't you wear 'em both?
Yeah.
I could do that.
Ok.
Yeah.
Where are we?
We're in the middle of the ocean.
I know we're in the middle of the ocean, you idiot.
Where in the middle of the ocean?
Who do I look like to you, a compass?
You a navigator, stupid.
You are navigator, stupid.
Dumb stupid.
Who is holding the map?
Who is holding map?
Oh. I am.
So you are navigator.
Ok. Give it to me.
Oh, no.
Give it to me.
I am navigator.
Give it to me.
I am navigator.
Give it to me.
Look what you are doing.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
Huh?
Oh!
Uh!
Uh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
My map.
My map.
I want my map.
I want to just tell you thank you for giving me another chance up here.
You're really nice to me.
I appreciate it, and I swear this time, you're not gonna be disappointed, because, well, I've been workin' on an act.
Man: Who cares?
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, I figured
I'd begin off...
I'll tell you what happened to me inside.
There was an old lady in there, right, and these 4 guys were, like, really messin' with her and givin' her trouble, these really... hoodlums, bad-lookin' characters, and one of 'em stole her purse, and another one...
I was watchin' this the whole time...
Grabbed her by the ring and was tryin' to yank her wedding ring off.
It was very expensive,
I guess,
'cause she was fighting and fighting.
She was screaming,
"help me, help me, help me."
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.
I ran over to the guy.
I said, "hey, buddy",
"why don't you put some butter on her finger and the ring will slide right off."
Woman: You suck, loser.
Ekebem?
What?
Do you like me?
No.
Not at all?
Not at all.
I like you.
So?
So, you should like me, too, you know?
It's a boat.
It's a boat.
The boat.
The boat.
The boat.
The boat.
It's a boat.
Miss Australia, you are dead!
It's a boat.
You are dead, miss Australia!
Well, don't think
I'm a bad guy,
'cause I'm not a bad guy.
I'm pretty cool.
I mean, I have a conscience, that's what
I'm tryin' to say.
Like, when I was a kid,
I used to steal alka-seltzer all the time, and I'd feed the seagulls, and they'd blow up.
First woman: Pu!
Second woman:
We like 'em big, boy.
Boo!
Boo!
Man: Hey, idiot.
I don't get it.
I think this is funny.
Is it me? Do I have no idea of what makes people laugh?
Do I know nothing about the art of comedy?
Hmm.
I wonder what
Milton berle would do if he was in that spot.
Milton berle: Hey, kid, you got a light?
That... that sounded like Milton berle.
Are you Milton berle?
If it's not, I had a lot of fun with his wife.
Were you just talking to yourself?
Did I hear you say you were a stand-up comic?
Yes, sir.
Hey, pretty good lookin' for one of them, and I love that shirt you're wearin'.
You never throw anything away, do you?
I'm kiddin'.
Sit down.
Have a seat.
Right here at your table?
No, in the kitchen.
Thank you, Mr. berle.
What's your name?
Schecky moskowitz.
Schecky moskowitz.
With a name like that, you should get a laugh right away.
So, kid, it looks like you have a problem.
You're thinkin' about something.
Tell me, what can I do for you?
Well, Milton...
Oh, I'm sorry...
Mr. berle,
I need your advice on getting laughs.
I was on this ship, and I did my act, and nobody laughed, and I couldn't understand why.
Tell me one of the jokes that you did on the ship.
Oh, all right. Ok.
All right.
There are these two hoodlums, right, and they see this old lady, and this lady's got this big ring on, so they run over and they start yanking on her ring, and they're pullin' on the ring, and this lady's lookin' at me, goin', "help me, help me, help me," and, you know, I had to do somethin', so I run over to the hoodlums, right?
Hold it.
Hoodlums?
Is this the butter joke?
Yeah.
That's the joke.
No wonder they didn't laugh.
Were there any hoodlums or gangsters in the audience when you told that joke?
Uh, no. I told it to a bunch of beauty queens.
Beauty queens?
Oh, no.
And then I told them the one about blowing up the seagulls.
Blowing up seagulls.
Kid, you're using the wrong technique.
Young man, come over here just...
Have you got a pencil on you?
Yes, sir.
Well, thank you very much.
You got a pad?
Sure.
That's it.
Thank you.
All right.
Now you're workin'.
Schecky...
All right.
Don't make a whole federal case out of it.
What I'd like you to do now, write these gags down, schecky.
I think all those beautiful queens will identify with them.
Last week,
I dated a girl that had everything a man would want...
Mustache, hair under the arms, bushy eyebrows.
You talk about the same girl.
You say, what a nose.
She had to lift it to eat.
And follow that up with, one good lipstick brought out her lips, and one good sneeze brought out her teeth.
This girl had very affectionate eyes.
They always kept lookin' at each other.
This should be a boffo.
And when she opened one eye, all she could see was the other one.
And her boobs were very small...
So small, she had to carry her nipples in her pocket.
Now, you try those jokes, schecky.
They'll all work.
They always did.
Well, so long, kid.
Lots of good luck.
Thank you,
Mr. berle.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Schecky, always remember that you're a comic, that you possess the strongest weapon for bringing people together and making them feel happy.
There's nothing more important in the world than the power of laughter.
Remember that.
Bye-bye.
Whoa.
The power of laughter.
King Neptune was talkin' about the power of laughter.
Maybe this phrase is gonna, like, tie the whole story together in some clever way or something.
Hmm.
Uh, where am I goin'?
I have no idea where I am right now.
I'm walkin' around like
I know where I'm goin'.
I don't know what...
Let's see.
How do I get back to the ship?
Maybe I should use some, like, magical comedy phrase.
I'll try that. Um, ok.
Why'd the chicken cross the road?
Nothin'. Nah. No good.
Um, why do firemen wear red suspenders?
No good. Nothin'.
Um, ok. Uh, take my wife, please.
Ooh. That's the one, right there.
Right there.
Take my wife, please.
Take my wife, please.
Take my wife, please.
Take my wife, please.
[Appreciative laughter]
Hey. Hey.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you, baby.
All right.
Ho ho ho!
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Well, anyway, so I see this guy on the street the other day, right?
He tells me he's got agent orange.
I said, "at least you have an agent." Boom!
Ha ha!
All right. Ok.
My grandmother.
I was talkin' to my grandmother the other day.
What a lady.
You'd love her.
She's deaf in both ears, right, so we bought her
2 hearing aids.
She keeps puttin' 'em both in the same ear.
She's deaf over here, she's got, like, bat-like hearing over here.
Did somebody say nursing home?
That's her. That was her voice. Ha ha!
[Machine guns firing]
[Crowd screaming]
What's happening?
Who is that over there?
What's going on?
Hey, I thought...
What, is there a sale on bikinis or something?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
I'm doin' great.
These people love me.
You see, I'm finally cookin'.
I'm start...
I'm a-rollin'.
Oh!
Ow.
Come on. We got to get out of here.
Why?
My God! My God!
Terrorists! Terrorists!
That's why.
Oh.
[Rumbling]
Holy shit.
[People screaming]
We fuckin' hit an iceberg.
We hit an iceberg.
Holy shit.
Another Titanic.
Hurry up, schecky.
Come on, get in here.
I'm comin',
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
Where is miss Australia?
We want her now.
She's ours.
We are not fooling around here.
We got a big, fat problem here.
We need to have a little talk with her.
This is no joke.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Hello.
Testing 1, 2, 3.
Hello.
This is going out to all the people on the boat.
All the people.
All we want is miss Australia.
Mrs. Australia!
Miss Australia!
Miss Australia?
Say, isn't that the late
Dickie diamond's girlfriend?
How would I know?
I haven't done any scenes with Dickie diamond and his girlfriend.
I'm quite sure it is.
Hey, that's great.
They want to kill her.
She's a real bitch, man.
You guys shouldn't talk mean about people behind their backs.
Oh, well, I didn't see you there.
I'll say it to your face.
You're a pig, honey.
You were mean to me the other night in the bar.
Well, I was a different woman back then when Dickie was alive.
Now that he's dead,
I'm my own woman.
I've got my own mind and it works for me and nobody else.
Good for you.
Mrs. Australia!
Miss Australia, you little kangaroo, big mouth bad breath.
You better come out!
Oh, my God.
It's time to meet your mayor.
My God, they want me to meet the mayor?
No, no. I think he's speaking broken English right there.
He wants you to meet your maker.
He wants to kill you.
Do you have an education?
[Crying]
Oy, miss Australia, when I find you,
I'm gonna take your hands and I'm gonna cut off all your pretty little fingernails and I'm gonna swallow them...
Yum!
And they're gonna go through my digestive tract.
And the only thing is, they're not gonna digest!
Oh, my God! He can't.
All I said was that general noriega had bad breath.
It took me months to grow these.
You know, I broke one, and then just as it was growing back,
I broke another one.
They're finally all even.
He can't do it.
He can't!
I've got to get out of here!
No, no, Ellen.
Ellen, wait!
Wow.
Don't women look funny when they run in heels?
Let's go.
Oh, there she goes!
Well, go, go!
[Fires gun]
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Oh!
Look out!
* nowhere to run to, baby *
* nowhere to hide, no
* got nowhere to run to, baby *
* and nowhere to hide
* it's not love I've been running from *
* it's the heartbreak
I know will come *
* 'cause I know you're no good for me *
* but you've become a part of me *
* everywhere I go
* your face I see
* every step I take
* you take with me
* nowhere to run to, baby *
* nowhere to hide, yeah... * hey, what's with the shirt?
Oh, this one?
Yeah, that shirt.
Oh, I like the pink one, and Bob likes the green one.
Which one do you like?
They both stink.
* I know you're no good for me *
* but free of you
* I'll never be
* no
* each night as I sleep
* into my heart you creep *
* I wake up feelin' sorry I met you *
* hopin' soon that I'll forget you *
* when I look in the mirror *
* to comb my hair
* I see your face
* just a-smilin' there
* yeah
* nowhere to run to, baby *
* nowhere to hide
* run to, baby
* got nowhere to run...
Oh, God.
Hey, what's wrong?
Just because I'm pretty, everybody thinks I'm stupid.
Where did that come from?
I hate being beautiful.
Sometimes I wish
I was an ugly, old hag with burn marks or warts all over my face and people would just run in terror when they looked at me.
Why?
Because being pretty isn't pretty.
Look, look. We don't have time for this.
You see, I have this morbid desire to be deformed.
God, that's beautiful.
I never realized how hard it was for a young girl to be so gorgeous.
It's a living hell.
[Machine gunfire]
* got nowhere to run to, baby *
* nowhere to hide
* I know you're no good for me *
* but free of you
I'll never be, no... * climb the ladder.
Climb the...
Why do you want 'em to climb the ladder?
[Sighs]
* hopin' soon
* that I'd forget you
* when I look in the mirror *
* to comb my hair
* I see your face
* just a-smilin' there
* yeah
* nowhere to run to, baby *
* nowhere to hide
* run to, baby
* got nowhere to run from you, baby *
* oh, no
* I know you're no good for me *
* but you've become a part of me *
* how can I fight a lover... * oh, God.
They're gonna kill me before I get a chance to be an actress.
All my hopes, all my dreams.
I had a line on general hospital last week.
You did?
What was it?
"Can I get you something from the bar?"
Oh, my God.
I say that all the time.
Really? Oh, I wish you'd been there to coach me.
Me, too.
Oh, jeez, I can't believe this.
Do you think
I should tell her about Bob's little infection, huh?
Should I?
Forget it.
Yo, miss Australia?
You better come out here, or I'm gonna have to start killing hostages in 30r 4 seconds...
3 seconds!
Starting with this girl here.
Maybe we should try to save her.
No, she always wins whenever we compete.
This could be my only chance for miss international.
Now that is a competitive bitch right there.
I'm so selfish.
I've got to give myself up.
You guys stay here.
Just kidding...
Look, I think the general's a great guy.
I only said it to be smart.
Look, he probably smells terrific.
Come to mention it, you guys aren't so bad yourself...
Aah!
Shut up! Shut up!
[Squealing]
Hey, Bob?
What are we gonna do about this?
Well, maybe we should try to save her.
Yeah, yeah, Bob.
What?
Well, I figured you just had your tongue down the girl's throat.
Maybe you should go and save her.
[Screaming]
Come on, schecky.
Don't put me on the spot.
I have a really strong fear of death.
Oh, I got a fear of death, but I also have a stronger sense of guilt, man, and jeez,
I mean, you were just making out with the girl.
I would feel you'd kind of want to save her.
Fine, fine!
Fine, I'll go.
I'll go and get shot at saving some girl
I was just kissing.
You stay here...
Coward!
Oh...
Get off of her!
I was lying to Bob right there.
I do have a stronger fear of death compared to my sense of guilt, but death... ew...
Makes me nauseous.
I don't want death.
You get buried underground, you get dirt all over you with worms... ew...
That's not good.
So, you know, if I get out there, there's a chance
I'm gonna get shot, and I don't like that, and that's not good for my career, either.
You know that and I know that.
I ain't going.
Oh, yeah.
Come to think of it...
Where do you think we go...
When we die?
I'm thinking of that right now.
Well, I feel everyone goes to purgatory first.
And then, after everyone prays for you, you go to heaven.
Heaven is a place up above...
Pearly gates.
Heaven is bright lights, real calm, real serene.
Lots of angels and things.
Ah, I'll tell you what I think.
I think that when we die, we just get on this dark, lonely spiral...
Right down to nothingness.
That's where we go, and that's not cool with me.
So, I'm not gonna get out there, because I could get shot, and that would happen to me...
Milton's voice: Schecky, you remember the power.
Kill 'em with laughs before they kill you.
That was that berle guy again.
I guess I better shut up.
What? What?
Milton: Use the power of laughter.
Laughter?
Power of laughter?
He always said that.
Maybe that has a meaning or something.
Power of...
Oh, ah, ah!
I know what he means.
Yeah...
I know what he means.
I'll get the...
Skeedil-ee-Dee-da-Dee!
Skeedil-ee Dee-da-Dee!
Aah!
Who are you?
Ah, moskowitz.
Schecky moskowitz.
What's your name there, pal?
I'm achmed.
Ah, achmed, with a lot of spit there.
That's good.
What do you do for a living, there, huh?
I fight for the people.
The people's people's people.
Ah, I like people.
Freedom fighter.
That's me.
I work for the contra rebels sometimes.
I'm sure you do.
I would, too...
Sometimes I deliver for domino's.
Half hour or less.
Ok, miss Australia.
Any last requests?
Yes...
I'd like to sing one last song...
I won the miss Australia contest with this last year, and it would really mean a lot to me.
Ok, sing your heart out.
* Australia's sons
* let us rejoice
* for we are young and free... * this is how my mother carried me when I was a baby.
But can you let go a little, please, because I'm a little sick.
You know, when I'm sick, my mother always tells me to drink liquids.
I think she's right, though, because every time
I drink a solid, I choke.
Boom! Ha ha ha.
Yeah.
* with golden soil and wealth for toil *
* our home is girt by sea... * yeah, speaking of drinks, you know...
This is what I do to get free drinks.
I kind of insult a girl.
I say, "baby, you're kind of ugly."
She takes her drink and throws it in my face.
I open up my mouth, right?
And after 6 or 7 girls,
I get a good buzz going.
Ha ha ha!
* Australia's sons
* let us rejoice
* for we are young and free * ok, ok.
That was beautiful.
[Continues singing unintelligibly]
Ok, that does it!
Aah!
[Laughing]
Yeah, why don't you give it a whirl, baby?
Come on, give it a try.
Go ahead.
So I said to the man...
Take my wife...
Please?
Yeah!
Speaking of, um...
My wife, she's so fat...
How fat is she?
She's so fat...
That when she sits around the house, she's all the way around the house.
[Weakly singing]
Darling...
Achmed...
I want to be a comedian.
I make the people laugh.
I think they love me.
I... i...
[crying]
Are you ok?
Yeah.
Are you ok?
Well, I have a little bump on my head, but I don't think it shows a bruise.
Oh...
Why did you save me?
Because I love you.
Oh, jeez, do you?
I love you, too.
Will you marry me?
Oh, yeah.
I think I'm a laugher, not a fighter.
Kiss me.
What about killing miss Australia?
No, forget it.
Schecky said we could move in with him and we could... we could live in America with him and when...
He could teach us the fine art of comedy.
Really?
Really.
Will he write all his own, uh, comedy material for us?
I will write all your material, of course, and if you guys want,
I'll get you in a movie.
See that? There's a movie camera, right there.
Why don't you guys do some comedy?
Right now, for that camera.
The movies?
Ok...
Ok, um...
So, um...
What's invisible and smells, um...
Like, like, carrots?
Uh, carrots.
Ok, I know that one.
I know that one...
I don't know that one.
I don't know.
You don't know it?
It's 'cause it's...
It's little, teeny bunny fart.
[Laughing]
Daddy, let me out.
I won't be fooling around anymore.
I promise.
Who is it running over to first base...
With the second base there guy?
Must be...
Both: Third base!
[Laughing]
Love...
You don't have any love.
You don't deserve to wear this.
Somebody...
Please let me out.
I swear to God,
I will never flip anybody off again.
I'll never curse.
Somebody, please?
If you're up there...
Please.
Ahh...
You stupid motherfuckers.
You stupid fucks!
I'm an atheist!
Heh heh heh heh heh.
Ow.
Achmed: So, I'm for to play in the baseball and I'm making touchdown for the home team.
I'm the hero!
[Laughing]
So, speaking of the baseballs, how many one-eyed lizards does it take to make a two-eyed lizard?
Hey, hey, you motherfucker.
3, 3 one-eyed lizards.
Why is it 3?
3 one-eyed lizards, because one of them is blinder.
[Laughing]
[Achmed and ekebem continue bantering]
How can he see?
Because he's a blind lizard!
You fucking ugly motherfuckers...
Get the fuck off my stage.
I want my fucking job back.
Woman: Hey, look!
That's the dead guy!
Man: Yeah, that's the dead comedian.
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.
Dead? You stupid motherfucker,
I'm not dead.
I'm right here.
I was locked in the bathroom, you stupid...
You fucking hijacking,
2-on-one cheaters.
Fuck...
Me!
Thank you very much.
Thank you...
[Laughing]
I am terrorist.
I'm like Rambo.
I am like Rambo.
[Gun cocks]
I am Rambo!
[Gunshot]
Well...
All right.
Everything worked out just fine, now didn't it?
Let's see.
Well, that rock star and his sleazy manager?
They have girls hanging all over 'em now.
And Bob, he has a gorgeous wife-to-be.
How he got her,
I'll never know, but stranger things have happened.
And even those terrorists.
They got what they wanted...
An audience.
I...
I guess I got what
I wanted, too, you know?
Now, I'm a big, funny comedian.
I'm even a hero, but something's missing.
I'm not sure what it is.
I got a surprise for you.
Neptune, how you been?
I haven't seen you in a while.
I'm swell.
I got someone
I want you to meet.
Slimy!
Slimy?
Hello.
Neptune: This is my daughter, slimy!
Hello, slimy.
My little guppy's been watching you in her conch shell for a week now, and she's just been begging me to introduce you.
You've been watching me in your conch shell?
Yes.
I really, really, wanted to meet you.
Wow, she is so sweet.
Hey, um, king Neptune,
I was just wondering if I could take her to the bow of the ship and maybe give her a kiss, you know, to close the movie.
Is that all right?
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
All right...
But have her back at the reef by 11:00!
And no tongues!
* oh, boy
* who's that girl over there? *
* I really got to talk to that chick *
* because that is one cool, sugar candy girl *

[Schecky laughing maniacally]
[Laughing continues]
[Laughing stops]
'So, since your sister got her security clearance,
'we've both been making a bet about where we think you are.
'She says you're probably out on a submarine, and, er...
'I say you're probably up on a secret base
'somewhere around the north pole or something.
'I figure if you're on a submarine,
'you probably wouldn't be able to get these tapes.
'Plus, everybody knows that submarines only stay out for three months.
'But...
'Honey, er...
'Something weird has been happening lately.
'Er, I mean...
'What I'm saying is that
'it's like you died and I've gotten over it.
'I was having these dreams for a long time that you did die.
'And then I'd wake up and I'd realise that if you did,
'there would be no way
I would have of knowing,
'and maybe you are already dead.
'They kept becoming more and more real until, er...
'I finally was feeling a little bit desperate.
'So I told them when they came to pick up the tape a few times ago,
'and, er... they sent out an army psychiatrist for me.
'He wasn't a whole lot of help. He said he didn't know where you were either,
'but he knew it wasn't dangerous, so I shouldn't worry.
'I should just... try to be patient.
'But um... I don't have them anymore.
'That's because I've decided that you are dead.
'I've put that in my mind so that I won't be too disappointed when you don't come back.
'I'll have already adjusted myself to it.
'But if you ever walk through that door again,
'It'll be like a miracle from God.
'You'll be a gift from heaven.
'And my life's gonna pick up where it left off the day you walked out.
'Hey!
'I got a surprise for you.
'Remember when I told you that your sister was going to get her security clearance?
'Susie, come here.
'Come over here and say hi to your brother.'
'Hi, how are ya? Getting any lately?
'I had a lot of things to tell you, but I can't remember them now.'
Thanks.
Um...
You...
It's not my, er, business, but...
Howe, you're not going to give me a lecture now, are you?
No. No.
We've only got six months left.
Six months, Howe!
You know, I used to think that I was very tough.
I mean, you have to be to get through training school with assholes like Walker.
But I swear to God,
I do not know if I am tough enough for six more months of this.
You know what I keep thinking about?
I keep thinking about putting on... too much makeup and, er... doing my nails real red, putting on something real slinky.
Going down to some sleazy bar.
Picking up a bike gang.
It's a joke, Howe.
- We don't have to do this now.
- Walker, yes, I do.
'They're not that bad, are they?'
Mmm. It's been a while.
What? Since you've seen two people have sex on TV?
No.
Since I've seen a woman.
I'm crushed, Walker.
You got me right where I live.
I need a urine sample, now.
'Both Washington and Moscow are gripped with alarm and confusion today
'with news that an American cruise missile
'landed in the Soviet industrial city of Veronich,
'300 miles southeast of Moscow.
'Although the missile contained a one megaton thermonuclear warhead,
'it did not detonate
'and is now in the hands of Soviet defence officials.
'Sources close to the navy are now indicating
'that a US navy supply ship disguised as a tramp steamer,
'which was hijacked yesterday in the Mediterranean,
'may have been carrying eleven tomahawk cruise missiles
'capable of reaching cities such as Veronich.
'The navy has stated that the hijacking was carried out by what it called "pirates"
'or forces who may be loyal to or under the control of the Libyan government
'or the North African Defence Alliance.
'In a moment, we will go live to Washington
'to bring you a report on the reaction from Capitol Hill.'
You're not gonna believe this.
That US supply ship that Libya captured yesterday - it just said on the news, it had eleven tomahawks on it, and one of them just landed in Russia.
'No official confirmation of a possible nuclear incident involving Soviet cities,
'but we are now aware that a full stage alert has been called for.
'All NATO forces, both conventional and strategic,
'fighters have been scrambled.
'B-52's are now airborne,
'and cruise missiles have been dispersed to their covert launch sites in Europe.
'In a hastily organised speech to Congress,
'the President indicated that
American forces are fully prepared
'to retaliate against any aggressive moves by the Soviets.
'He has advised the nation to go about its business as normal
'until the tension subsides.
'The President closed his address by stating that...'
Oh, my God!
Get Walker!
Wa... Walker!
Walker!
I don't believe it.
DEF-CON 2.
You ready to do this?
Maybe we should see if we can detect anything.
So what have you got?
I think I'm coming up with heat trails on infrared, lots of them.
Super atmospheric?
All right, Walker. Fire.
No, look, it might be some sort of limited exchange, military targets maybe!
Let's wait for War 1 before we fire!
This is only a bad dream.
All right, look, it's happening, right?
- Yes, Jordan, it's happening.
- All right, then launch, Walker!
We'll launch when we get War 1.
Maybe the order can't get through.
Look...
We're supposed to fire on our own discretion if we have evidence that an attack has started and we believe that War 1 can't get through.
We'll launch when I say we launch, OK?
- Try some Earth signals.
- Will do!
'...have explosions over seven Soviet cities.'
The stations are all disappearing!
They're all getting blown away!
- What about the baby?
- Shut up, Howe.
Your family has a chance, they live in a remote area.
Mine are in Seattle.
I just saw Seattle go.
I'll check Detroit.
We have a solid object alert.
Russian, right? It's Russian, isn't it?
Walker, we've got to do it now.
We don't have any more time.
We've got to drop the payload!
Walker, you bastard! Fight!
I'm warning you, Jordan.
- Twelve kilometres per second.
- The range, Howe!
- 642 kilometres.
- That gives us 50 seconds.
Which one of our warheads passes closest to it?
The Leningrad is four degrees off.
- What number is Murmansk?
- Seven.
Seconds... make it twelve!
- Ready.
- Do it!
Of course all these results are conditional.
On what?
On what? I don't know on what.
This does not account for the... unknown.
I mean, all these estimates are based on atmospheric conditions, radiation levels, surface movement, weather, all things measurable from thousands of miles away.
So what area came out best?
Antarctica.
OK, say we got no orders and decided to go back to Earth - where should we go to ensure our best chance of survival?
Seychelles.
Easter Island.
Parts of Central America.
I can't help but notice you've been listening to that thing at the same time every night.
I suppose it doesn't make any difference.
I'm listening for my wife.
She's got a transmitter, sort of like a ham radio.
'Cecil?
'Cecil?
'I don't know if you can hear me or not, but I'm going to do this anyway.
'You're probably dead like most people.
'Cecil, you better be able to get this.
'This is gonna be a farewell from my spirit to your spirit.
'Honey, we didn't get hit, so everything was OK at first.
'Everything was OK, except...
'except that your sister and a lot of people in Redwood county, they got blinded.
'But then we got the disease.
'And some people, they think have got something, probably from the radiation.
'It's terrible.
'Everybody's dying.
'They say the germs have been affected by the radiation.
'Honey.
'The baby died.
'He got the disease.
'And they found out and they shot him and they burned him right away.
'And then they took all the food that we'd buried,
'and I have to stay quarantined in the house now.
'Honey, I don't feel well.
'My gums are bleeding.
'I think I've got it, too.
'I miss you so much.
'And I... I want to see you again.
'I don't want to die.
'We're going to try to get away.'
Radiation down there is incredibly high.
Yeah, it is.
But we're going back to Earth... now!
- Sorry?
- I'm going to help them.
I'm going to help Alice and my sister get out of there somehow.
Howe, your wife is dead.
You fuckface!
Howe! Calm down!
We're not going down into any radioactive disease-land.
You just calm down now.
Get your hands off me.
Well, all right.
What about you, Jordan?
Howe, I haven't got anybody back there to go looking for.
On the other hand, we're really not doing any good up here.
I think that we should support him.
All right, there you have it.
Two for, one against. We're going back!
Two for and one against.
That one happens to be me!
And I'm the captain!
And this is not a democracy.
So we're staying!
This isn't my program.
Walker!
Walker, we've got to jettison the bombs!
- I gave them 60 hours.
- That'll have to do.
Number 11 won't stay on.
Do it!
Howe, I don't know what you did, but I'm going to kill you when I get half a chance.
I'm telling you this is going down by itself, this is not my program!
I've got an O2 leak on four.
That's not a very good landing.
Jordan!
I can't find a pulse.
Man, I think she broke her neck!
Her pupil moved.
She's not dead.
- She's got a pulse.
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.
- I think it's just a concussion.
Got a shovel?
It wasn't me that made us come down here.
This is useless.
Useless!
OK, I'll dig.
Maybe I should see if number 11 was really malfunctioning when we jettisoned the bombs.
I said... No, listen.
Wait.
Yeah, I know I heard them.
I know I can hear it.
Oh.
Hey! Hey, guys!
Can you hear me?
Quick.
You know, we got...
We got months of food, Walker.
Months of it! And, er...
I don't know, we'll find us a boat and... and build us a raft or something.
We'll head down to someplace safe like Central America.
And, er... I'll drop you off or...
I don't know, you could come with me,
I'm going to head up to Oregon.
And, er... I don't know, you think we could find a boat around here?
I don't know.
Hey, I see, I can feel them.
I can feel a guy there, you guys!
Come on!
Hey! They've got a hold of my hand.
Hey, Walker!
Get it off! Got my hand, dude!
Walker! They've got my hand!
Walker! Walker!
- Walker what are you doing?
- Hold on!
I've got...
Hey!
Walker!
Oh!
Come here, Walker.
Come here!
Walker!
Come here!
Walk...
No!
No! Walker!
Hey, Jordan.
Welcome to Earth.
Don't do anything before you listen to this.
'I now accept the fact
'that Alice must surely be dead.
'And Jordan, Walker's dead, too.
'Six hours ago, we were trying to dig our way out of here,
'and somebody...
'or something out there
'grabbed him and killed him.
'I'm going to take advantage of the dark.
'I'm going to leave and try to find somebody.
'I'll try to be back at 08:00.
'I'll knock three times.
'Don't let anybody else in.'
Huh!
Er, hello.
Look, my name is Howe.
I'm a Lieutenant Commander with NORAD.
You know what that is?
That's the North American Air Defence.
I've got nothing to do with those guys.
I've been in space for the last 15 months,
I came down here last night.
They, they... those guys, they started chasing me.
I... they, they killed my...
What do you want? I got...
I got four months' supply of food!
Let's talk about the food.
You finished?
You're pretty wasteful.
Thanks.
Who is that?
So you expect me to believe that you're from NORAD and that you came here from outer space for no reason?
Look, I don't expect you to believe anything.
All I know is I got four months' supply of food, and if you don't believe it, then you're just passing it up.
I'll make you a deal on the food.
You give me the food or I'll kill you.
What do I get if I give it to you?
You get to live.
- If you're lucky.
- If I'm lucky?
Yes.
You give me the food, and I'll let you go.
You get to skedaddle on down the road.
And then the kids will kill you.
And I'll be happy and the kids will be happy, and you'll be dead.
Well, I don't like that deal.
What if I give you half of the food in exchange for one of those guns?
You've got a sense of humour.
What would you do if I gave you the gun, and half the food?
Look, I just want to get out of here.
Go to someplace safe, maybe Central America?
Just get in your rocket ship and fly off to Central America?
No. I figure I'll find a boat.
What kind of boat?
A sailboat.
Do you think that if there was a sailboat around here,
I would be sitting here, breathing in radiation?
Those goddamn kids!
Hello.
Hi.
Um...
You don't mind me asking who you are?
No.
Who are you?
None of your business.
Would you untie me?
Er... listen.
You untie me,
I'll get you some real strawberries.
You want shrimp cocktail?
I got shrimp cocktail.
Want a turkey dinner, you got it!
I've got crates of food.
You know how to sail?
- Yeah.
- Hmm...
You look kinda innocent, but, er... what choice have I got, right?
OK.
OK, I'll make a deal.
We split your food, and I'll get us to a sailboat.
But if you leave me, you lose the boat. Got it?
Good.
All right then.
What kind of boat is it?
What do you mean, "what kind of boat"?
It's a sailboat.
How big is it?
Big enough.
OK, Captain Walker.
Let's go.
Walker?
Put the guns down.
Get outside.
- Why?
- Cos I don't want to mess up my floor.
- You don't want the food?
- I don't give a shit about the food anymore.
Get outside.
Well, there's more than food, there's marijuana.
Oh really? What kind?
- Columbian.
- Oh, wow!
I don't smoke dope, and I don't like people who do.
Well, listen, you think you're going to find this food and keep it all to yourself?
I told you,
I don't give a shit about the food!
She's not letting anybody in.
She won't let you in.
You won't get in.
Who's she?
She's an astronaut.
She's a doctor.
What's she like?
She's... got brown hair.
What... what kind of areolas does she have?
- Pink, brown or red?
- Red.
- Pointed or rounded?
- Pointed.
So, if, er... say I give you a knife and let you go, you give me two thirds of the food and this woman?
I give you three quarters of the food.
That's verywhite of you.
So we have a deal?
Yeah, as long as there's no surprises, we have a deal.
Terminals! Get low!
No, no, no...
Is this the beach?
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe. It was dark.
J.J.
I want you to go over that hill.
And see if you can see a, er... rocket ship.
And watch out for the lunatics from Fort Liswell.
J.J.!
- I don't like it.
- Vinny McKinnon.
We meet again.
It's really nice to see you again, Vinny.
- Hold it right there, Vinny!
- Squeal like a pig!
It's a fake!
Pull!
Pull, you lazy bastards!
Pull!
Pull!
Come on, pull!
Pull!
Pull you bastards!
Get your backs into it, come on!
You in the blue, pull your own weight for once!
Put your backs into it!
Put your backs into it, I said!
I'm talking to you!
You in the blue jacket!
All right, let's this time do it for real!
Pull! Put your backs into it!
Hey, what's happening?
Let's see.
Hey, sweetie!
See anything you like?
Ow!
Move it! Move it!
Come on! Hey!
Looking good!
Sit down.
I've got something real special to show you.
Tell me, Commander Howe, you wouldn't happen to know in which direction the prevailing winds blow in Patagonia, would you?
What?
Well, since Patagonia is in the southern hemisphere, the prevailing winds should blow in from the east.
But the mountains are in the way.
Commander, do you think the fallout could get over the mountains?
How did you know my name?
My, my, my!
Good things do come in threes.
I've missed you, J.J.
And you must be Vinny McKinnon.
Lacey, would you remove them before they putrefy the room, please?
Let them join Dr Jordan, see to it that they are as comfortable as she is.
I estimate that everyone here will be contaminated within the next two months.
The only solution is to escape to a clean zone.
Provided you can find the location of one.
I want you to know I'm really sorry about what happened to your friend Walker.
Some terminals found the capsule before we did, so there was nothing we could do.
You know, I was kind of surprised when
I found out that you people were up there.
I never suspected we had a secret line of space defence.
You weren't supposed to suspect.
- We found it.
- You sure?
Says Delta S-16 on it.
Oh, good news.
I guess that means I won't need
Commander Howe after all, will I?
Let him join his friends.
Oh, sorry.
Jesus!
Delta S-16, excellent.
- I'll have this sucker out of here in no time.
- OK.
Lacey, er... be real careful.
We'll bring it straight to Boomer's hut right away, OK?
You got it.

Hey, innocent, is that you?
Yeah... it's me.
Howe! Jesus, Howe!
Jordan! You all right?
Yeah, Howe, I'm all right.
Did you get my tape?
Yeah.
- Jordan, I...
- Howe, I'm so glad you're all right.
Um...
This is Mrs Boyd.
She stole a can of peaches.
A can of peaches.
Can you believe it?
I'm getting a little confused here.
Give me a few answers.
Who's this guy Gideon Hayes?
My boyfriend.
- Your boyfriend.
- Yeah. Ex-boyfriend now.
I was trying to get away from him when Vinny caught me in the woods.
So, what happened here?
I mean, how did this kid Gideon get control of all these people?
He has his ways.
You, um... might be interested to know how he's had control of you.
What are you talking about?
Well...
The day of the war, two months ago I guess it was,
I was at school, just changing classes with Gideon, when this navy helicopter lands on the lawn and Gideon's father gets out.
Well, next thing I know,
I'm at 5,000 feet in a helicopter carrying all this satellite equipment.
- Satellite equipment?
- Yeah!
With Gideon's mom and dad and a bunch of... navy brass.
And I'm worried about missing my poly-sci test till I find out I'm in the middle of World War Ill.
So what happened to all these navy people?
Where are his parents now?
They're dead.
We crashed.
I guess the helicopter was affected by a blast.
Only four of us survived.
Gideon and I, and Lacey who's a marine corporal.
And, um... a navy technician, a fat guy called Boomer who operated the equipment.
He was paralysed in the crash, though.
His back was broken.
OK, just... hold on a minute.
You're saying this guy Boomer had something to do with me landing here, that's what you're saying?
Er... well, yeah, but Gideon made him, because he wants to get to a survival station.
See, Gideon made Boomer transmit a program that would force you to land here when you decided to re-enter.
There's no way this guy Boomer could have had the facilities to do that.
Well, then you explain how you got here.
You guys wait out here.
Boomer.
You did a very good job.
I think we found our missing piece, and all the credit goes to you.
Boomer, how's your diet coming?
Brought you a nice, big, juicy cut of venison.
Now, I know that we haven't been the best of friends in the past.
But we can make up.
And after that, you'll have a nice meal.
You can't do it without me.
I've got nothing to live for.
Let's not be like that.
Let's be fair with one another.
I want to know where the survival stations are, and you know how to find out.
We can make a business proposition.
You help me this one last time... and I'll let you go.
Well...
We'll just start hooking up our little box while the steak is cooking.
Perfect.
OK, Boomer.
How do you want your steak cooked?
Where were you supposed to be headed in this helicopter?
Well, we were trying to get to a submarine that was waiting just off the coast of Newfoundland.
A lot of government big-wigs were headed there, too, but we had all their satellite equipment.
I'm sure they were rather unhappy that their equipment didn't show up.
I bet they were unhappy.
Come on sweetie, let's go.
Boomer, your steak is almost done.
I wouldn't want it to get burnt.
That would be wasteful.
Especially with so many people going hungry these days.
You'll give it to me if I tell you?
You have my word.
What difference does it make?
It's just a password.
Type "E pluribus funk".
"E pluribus funk"?
Ah, Boomer,
I knew you'd come through.
Boomer.
You've been a royal pain.
But you did come through, so I guess I'll have to keep my word.
Smells good, doesn't it?
I'm sorry, here let me...
Oh, look what I did!
I'm really sorry, well...
I guess it's too dirty for me to pick up now.
I think you better go down for it.
Boy, Boomer, do you smell!
You ought to pay more attention to your personal hygiene.
Well, you're on your own.
Oh, and er...
Thanks a lot.
See this? by north 19.02.40.
Know what that is?
The latitude and longitude of a survival station still intact, I bet.
Very sharp.
And that's where you and I and a couple of the others will be sailing starting tomorrow.
Does that make you happy?
No.
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
You see, I'm forgiving you for walking out on me.
Well, I don't forgive you.
For what?
For being a snake.
Come on, J.J.
You think I'm ruthless because I want to be.
It's the only way to administer limited resources in an unstable situation.
Can't you see that?
You want to go or not?
Come on, what do you say?
I say... go fuck yourself!
Take her back to her friends, please.
J.J.
Put up a notice that there will be a trial tomorrow morning.
Everyone should enjoy that.
Hey, Jordan, wondering what's going to happen to you?
The rules have changed, Jordan.
Looking good, Vinny!
What's the matter?
You miss your mommy?
Say goodnight!
J.J.
Oh, you look so pretty, J.J.
You make me sick!
Howe!
Real cool, Howe.
All rise in the presence of Gideon Hayes.
Sit down.
We have before us today
Commander Cecil Howe.
Dr Ava... Eva Jordan.
Jacqueline Jameson and Vincent McKinnon.
Commander Howe and Dr Jordan, you've admitted your participation in the nuclear war machine that has brought such devastation in our lives.
So you stand accused of crimes against humanity.
So let's have it.
All those who find Commander Howe and Dr Jordan guilty... say, "Aye!"
Aye!
All those who find Cecil Howe and Eva Jordan not guilty, say, "Nay!"
Guilty.
Hang the bitch!
Jacqueline Jameson, also known as J.J., stands accused of the worst of crimes, treason.
She was one of my closest friends, and my having to bring her here before you demonstrates the gravity of her crime.
All those who find J.J. guilty.
Aye!
Not guilty?
Guilty.
And our friend Vincent McKinnon.
Vinny's presence has been long awaited in this courtroom.
He stands accused of so many crimes against the people of Fort Liswell that I shall not bother to list them.
All those who find Vincent McKinnon guilty, say, "Aye!"
Aye!
No!
Not guilty?
Guilty.
Does anyone have anything to add before I pass sentence?
This court hereby sentences
Commander Cecil Howe, Dr Eva Jordan,
Jacqueline Jameson and Vincent McKinnon to hang by the neck until they are dead.
Such sentence to be executed immediately.
I have an idea.
Er, take the tape off of J.J.'s mouth.
I'm feeling in a generous mood.
I'm going to pardon you, J.J.
But that pardon is conditional.
J.J., you have to pull the lever that hangs the others.
So, do you accept?
I'm still feeling in a generous mood.
I'll make the same offer to the rest of you.
I'll give one of you your freedom if you hang your friends.
If you accept, be the first to step forward.
Let them drop! Drop!
Come on, yes or no?
Good man, Howe.
Cut him down, please.
Coming through, coming through.
Look out, back up.
Get out of the way, get out of the way.
Back up! Look out, coming through here.
When the drums stop, pull the lever.
If he doesn't pull it, shoot him, please.
Where's Howe?
- Find him!
- You guys go that way!
You three with me. Let's go!
- Let's go, lady!
- Yeah, yeah, OK, er... release them.
Look, you're in no position...
You got no time to argue, kid.
Release them.
- Put Vinny and J.J. back in the bunker.
- OK, second condition, no hangings.
OK, no hangings.
All right, I'll get my stuff from the ship.
You try anything at all, and you're all dead, OK?
OK, kid.
Don't put any strain on it for a week, etc. etc. etc.
Very nice work, Dr Jordan.
I should take you with me.
- Too bad there's not enough food.
- Yeah.
You're a real prince, Gideon, but er...
I think I'll just take my chances with the others, OK?
No, that wasn't the deal.
You're staying here for the meantime, and as for Vinny and J.J., well, I promised not to hang them, but they were lawfully sentenced, so I'll have them shot.
Why don't you give me another shot of painkiller?
Have 'em shot!
No, look, I've only got morphine here.
I think it's a little strong.
Morphine's fine.
Come on, woman.
- Lacey, will you...
- No, I... I've got it.
No. That's all right.
Why don't you let me do it, OK?
Lacey.
Hold her down, please.
Argh! Argh!
Goddamn!
Argh!
Try to play me for stupid?
Goddamn, kid.
Let's see what was in that bottle.
Potassium.
Not a very good painkiller.
Hey, up there! Talk to me!
I know you can hear me.
Hey! Hey, you. Come here.
I've got to see Gideon Hayes.
I said, I've got to see Gideon Hayes.
Hey, it's important.
He'll want to see me.
You're wasting your time.
We're all going to die in here.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Hey, come back here!
All right!
When was the last time you had a shower, Vinny?
What the fuck did you want?
Get off the boat.
That's right, just get off the boat, get in the water now.
That's right just stand right up.
Stand right up and get in the water.
No! Don't touch those guns!
Don't... don't... don't do it!
Don't pick them up.
Look, don't... don't pick them up.
Don't do it.
Look, just set them down now and get in the water.
Look, I shoot guys like you all the time.
There's no big deal for me.
So, just set them down and get in the water.
Don't hand him...
Don't take the other gun. Don't!
What are we doing?
Where am I going?
What are we doing? Where are we...
We're relaxing?
Come on!
Ready!
Don't! No, no, no.
- Aim!
- Wait!
Aren't you going to give a guy his last words?
To die with some dignity?
Please don't kill me.
Please.
I don't want to die.
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
I'm with you.
OK, I got guns here.
Who wants them?
Yeah, give me one of those!
Here. Here.
I'm behind you.
Come on, we're out of here.
Let's go.
Where's Jordan?
She's gone.
Gone with Gideon Hayes.
Where's J.J.?
She's gone with him, too.
Come on, let's go.
I'd never make it.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!
- Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.
- Oh, God, give me strength.
Get 'em.
There you go.
Come on, come on.
I think we'd better go.
Her body's cold.
Let's get to the boat.
All right, let's go, slimes!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Can you swim?
Lacey, would you collect all the guns, please?
Come on.
Come on.
Thank you.
Yours, too.
Thank you.
You've both done verywell.
I'll always remember you for that.
You're a good man, Lacey.
Stow these below.
We won't be needing them anymore.
J.J.
J.J.
Hey, hey.
It's cold up here.
Why don't you stay below.
I'll be there soon.
In a minute.
We've been through an awful lot together, haven't we?
Yeah.
Hey...
- Lacey!
- Yeah?
Shit!
I don't want to see you anymore, Howe.
Time to swim.
You go ahead! Kill her, and then I'm going to kill you.
You're a bluffer, Commander.
I knew you were bluffing when you stepped forward on the gallows.
You'd never hang your friends.
Swim for it, Gideon, you can make it to shore.
Commander, you have three seconds.
- One, two...
- Ow!
Shit!
Next time I'll kill you!
J.J.
Please.
J.J., please.
Please.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't all those be empty?
So, where is this renowned father? will father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps he cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
Very quick.
Move.
Some other dog beat us to the treasure.
Hear that?
No, please.
Mercy.
I will serve you.
Abelar, does it still exist?
Abelar?
Ah, yes.
Ruled by a queen, Eldoria.
She has passed on.
Her eldest... eldest child Ma'at is queen now.
Really?
I won't harm the queen, but I will make you do with her seed.
Not that it matters now.
I... I was wondering...
- how... how your enemies...
- To dust.
That will sting.
And now?
And now, say, "I won't feel anything except a little sting."
Tanis.
Tanis.
Are you listening to me?
- Sister.
- It is upon us, your dream.
It's happening.
After all of these years, the Sorceress has somehow returned from the dead.
Levana.
Please don't go.
Go, Lenor.
Please, find safety.
All of you leave at once.
I will alert the General,
Your Highness.
And we must find he who saved us before.
The Mercenary?
Your father.
But, our father is dead.
He died saving Abelar from the Sorceress.
Your father is not mine.
I was sired by the king but... you...
...you were by this mercenary.
Mother said you were the king's child to protect you.
You must leave the past behind.
Our kingdom needs us now.
Kingdom Bush is not my father?
No, but he who is lives.
If we so be separated mother said this will lead you to him. with this token, he will know you and you shall know him.
And this will help you to understand the sorcery.
My Queen.
They are within the palace,
Your Majesty.
You must come now.
You have to go.
No, come with us.
My Queen, you both have a long time to struggle.
I've trained you well,
Your Highness.
You are ready for what comes.
Stand. we can make sure of your safety if you follow this hall.
It will lead you out of the palace.
But what about you?
My duty is to remain here, Kara.
No.
If you stay, then so will I.
You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.
The Royals will scheme to save their skins. we will be left to fend for ourselves and not always with the truth.
They have no regard for us.
But I am sworn to...
You have sworn to love me, Dernier or was that just to weaken my will.
I love you.
Then save us my love.
- I must kill the infected.
- Leave her. She's a friend.
It's your wish.
There, it leads to a quay where our boat waits.
- It will take you to Durris.
- Durris?
An outlaw city?
If he still lives the people there will know his whereabouts.
Tanis,
I'm find remember what I said.
If we so be separated, you must find him. we've run out of time.
Run, Tanis.
- But sister.
- Hush.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
They count on us, Tanis.
- I can't do this alone.
- You must.
Go. Now.
I command you.
Do not look back...
...or rest.
It's been what, 20 years? where's your mother's lover? what was his name again?
It seems to have slipped my mind.
He has not slipped mine. why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.
I must have thought of a million different ways to make you and your mother suffer, but nothing was ever terrible enough.
I mean, how do you repay someone who buried you alive for 20 years?
Nothing smelled like life,
Your Highness.
You must be wondering how is it she is back looking so wonderfully restored.
Clearly, we watched your destruction.
Clearly, you shouldn't have given the final rights to a high priest with designs on your throat.
A pity he perished with some mysterious plague upon his return. who knows what lives in dust?
And who are you?
Go, go.
- where is my seat, Your Highness?
- I'm not sure.
Kill her.
Get the girl.
The palace is lost.
- The Queen is dead?
- Or worse. what are they?
Vampires.
But we will not die tonight.
I could fight harder.
You leave the killing to me. what is to become of us now or the kingdom?
My master is the son of a priest.
But, there is always a need for a pretty servant, and there is one against me as well.
- what is it?
- Hush, hush. why the guards they are so daunting?
They're trying to kill us. what?
Your blood.
It is read.
- It's my fault.
- No.
On your life run.
I have always loved you.
And who dies first.
I will.
And now, a ladder across the Abyss that I might free my father.
In my stead, you will awaken my seed.
She is the true daughter of my race, and though half human, she will be human no more.
Ah, Denier.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You used me. what?
No, I loved you.
Really?
Yes, right,
I was using you, Dernier.
You are evil.
Becoming a vampire isn't even the worst of me.
That and more.
Are you going to kill me now?
Bite my throat, drain me of my blood?
I want you.
I could soothe you, Dernier.
You could use someone like me for a slave.
I have too much over the past.
I will bring victims to you to fulfill whatever dark fantasies you have.
I will do whatever
I have to do for you?
You are a monster.
I will bow to you, Kara.
Kara, bow to her.
Life takes many forms in many worlds and she's in her final metamorphosis, her chrysalis. why me?
You are special.
But you've always known that.
Special in a way that no one else could see until it was too late.
And even as a child, you have always been cunning, intelligent, depraved.
You have tried to blend in or be a human, safe, but even as a child you knew you were different, filled with dark corruptness.
Are you ready to be free?
You're free now but not yet fully transformed.
I have pity for those who can walk in the curse of light and among these creatures. we have much more work to do before we can be safe.
I sent the princess to the reefs.
If she's dust, find her.
Know what she's plotting, and most importantly with whom. why me?
Because she will know and trust you when she's most vulnerable.
And if I refuse?
You've hungered for this day when you could be who you are and what you are to let those dark urges free.
Mother said this will lead you to him. with this token he will know you and you shall know him, and this will help you to understand the sorcery.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
My princess.
You shouldn't have been wearing this?
Please.
- You cheated Dog.
- what?
Go weep to the gods.
You will die.
I shall cleave your thick ugly faces.
No dog cheats me and lives.
Thankfully, I'm not a dog but I do like to cheat.
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you like a bitch pup.
Holy shit.
I want this man.
She wants me.
I'll tell you what, wench, let me kill this dog and then I will bed you so hard...
Somebody you want me. wench, you've diminished my reputation.
It could be diminished, sir? why bog me, did I do your mother, huh, or, uh, sister perhaps?
The last of it, the late great Abelar and how it came to be overcome.
- Sir.
- I mean no disrespect, lady.
I noticed your cloak.
It came from the palace guard.
So, it is.
Like yourself, I barely escaped these foul creatures.
I'm here to spread the word of what these eyes have seen.
- You've seen much.
- Aye.
In this one world.
That's why you're here.
You've seen far too much sir.
Brother and sister?
Different mothers but a common father.
And you say we were meant to find our father?
Exactly. And together we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia and return Abelar to the people.
Uh-huh.
So, Princess, you speak for the Royal House?
That is correct.
How much am I to be paid to save your precious Abelar?
Paid?
I didn't mention anything about a bounty. we do this because it's right
- and just and it's what we should...
- This sword will not be drawn until it received proper compensation.
You disappoint again.
Oh, my lady, one night in bed with me and...
I'm your sister.
Half.
How could I expect any nobility from a pig like you. wait.
Look, your tail holds a certain fancy, but I am in need of coin and I'm willing to take your word that there will be a bounty. what do you know about him? well, not much.
Nothing at all.
Nor a trickster?
Aye, but this trickster knows where our sister may be, and to her our dear father.
A sister? where?
About that bounty?
If your word proves true, then you shall have it.
I gave you my word.
That should be sufficient.
I am called Aedan.
And what are you doing here? what?
Can't a brother help his sister?
After five years?
No.
This comes with some terrible price.
You're not a woman with many an option.
There's a foul tempered undertaker and eventual traitor wanting to see you skinned at dawn.
And what is this act of brotherly love going to cost me?
It's more privilege than the price. we get to save Abelar.
I don't think I'm dressed appropriately.
Plus, of course, there is a bounty.
And where would you get real bounty?
From Abelar.
She's your sister.
But maybe a...
...little more. well, what is your name.
You would like to sit down and have a drink with me, huh?
Tell us the tale, sister.
A fortnight ago the Sorceress Xia captured Abelar.
My sister, the Queen, was murdered.
Xia?
Didn't father put that Devil wench down or is that another tall tale? well, clearly he didn't put her permanently down, thus creating an opportunity.
She's back and she's taking Abelar with sorcery. which is to say she's infested Abelar.
Don't you have any conversation for me?
You are so beautiful.
It's all Greek to me.
She will continue to feed, to spread her darkness until the next full moon rises.
- And then?
- Oh, this part is good.
Xia will open the doorway to the Nether worlds.
You were saying?
Thus ending our very existence.
It's all so dire.
You see, sister, there's no bounty too great for saving this world.
Say we fancy the idea for a moment.
And that there is this massive bounty in gold, of course.
Aye, what makes you think us three here can stop this Vampire Queen?
I told her we're lovers not fighters. when need to have a plan, something less daunting, more rewarding.
- I am at a loss.
- we should take the traditional action, and hire mercenaries, like our dear father.
Yes, yes, but we're under time constraints.
In only a fortnight the moon will be full.
- I have a thought.
- It was only a matter of time.
Malia, you will find father and see if he has any ideas on the matter, and I with what funds to princess has on her presently will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men, no, no, no, but the type with honor and courage enough to win back Abelar.
By the gods I've heard that there are experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria, precisely the type of warriors that we needs. So, the Princess... she can wait here at Durris for our return, you know, holding down the fortress
- sort of thing.
- Or let us split the funds you possess, give us both a chance to hire the best warriors we can find on our way.
Aye, that could work as well. well, sister?
You take me as a fool at your own peril.
You are both much less than I'd hoped.
At the prison I spoke to the magistrate and he gave me your recent histories,
- theft, assault, cheating, embezzling...
- Right.
- Pick pocket and street whore?
- I have never picked a pocket.
You're both are the lowest of character, but my sister was firm and we must find our father and you are my only hope. we'll need horses.
I can acquire them.
- Are there other brothers and sisters?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, she's a day's ride away in a village called Chiba
Agreed then to Chiba Village.
Our father still lives?
I suppose. Last summer he was carousing in the secret of Nobu.
That was years ago.
The dog is likely dead as a cock, though, rotting in some dungeon.
50,000 gold pieces.
50 and that's my final word.
And I suggest we seal this fast. what's going on, sir?
Having an adventure, sister?
- A bitch dog.
- Come to lose again?
It isn't long now.
An entire new world.
I use Xia's body as a conduct.
It's a doorway. what have you learned?
The princess seeks one like her father.
The warrior who helped with Mitadonia.
He can see us fall into the Abyss.
Reduce her to dust.
Should I kill them now, the Princess and these two fools?
Learn the whereabouts of this father.
As you wish.
I tried to find father once right here.
- what was it like?
- Ah, it was like this... except for people trying to kill me.
- It's early yet.
- Maybe they'll remember you.
Oh, Malia, they would if they were still alive.
I meant what was it like to see him?
I didn't see father.
I found Rajan, our half sister.
Stay put. what does Rajan do here as a trade?
You mean when she's not drunk or passed out?
Hello sister.
I have a wonderful opportunity for you.
No thank you.
It did not work out last time.
It's only because you lack a sense of humor. what do you think they seek?
This drink.
Sister told me great stories about father... although I thought she spoke of a hired mercenary sent to save Abelar.
That was before I knew he was my father.
The man who I thought was my father, the King, well he was killed by Xia.
You really want to know who father is, God's truth?
Yes.
Our father is the lowest form of cowardly dog, a man who takes advantage of wives or widows, sells out his cohorts for coin and runs from a real fight.
That's who father is. what's the matter?
You don't like the truth?
You married, have sons?
Luckily no.
They're not so bad to look at.
Your whores?
Rajan, say hello to your sisters.
- More family?
- And with your help, we four... will save Abelar before the full moon.
The full moon is six nights away.
Time is short.
Ho, an adventure.
Alana.
Alana?
I'd forgotten her.
She's all grown and ready to leave this stink hole.
Alana, your favorite uncle has returned.
Don't you remember me?
I remember.
As formidable as she is, the girl is but a girl.
I meant no offense, niece.
I taught her a few things in my days as emperor's assassin.
Yes, I can see.
Sir, this is the most serious and most dangerous mission.
It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.
The Vampire Queen.
- Yes, and it is not suitable for a child.
- You think I'd be afraid.
Look, it's time my Alana saw the world, had a few wild, bloody adventures.
And vampires and sorcery are all a part of that.
The truth is, she will love many and leave many more choking on their entrails.
A sister, heh?
And a princess no less.
Do you plan to rob her?
Give me a little credit.
This comes at a good time.
I was worried.
How so? with my adventuring and killing days were behind,
I wouldn't be able to give her proper parenting.
Oh, betting brutes, horrible wars, ghastly death, and it's all still ahead of you.
I am sure it's all with my daughter.
The gods must choose to smile upon me.
You would really cut my throat back there?
Of course, uncle.
Yours particularly.
Sweet girl. what of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?
Grandfather?
Our father?
Aye. He might crave one last good battle before setting down the sword?
- He's still killing?
- Oh, that rascal, his sword is always poised. want to meet the old dog?
Oh, let's be off.
There are kingdoms to save and men to bed.
I prefer wenches.
Then he lives? why not use your sorcery to destroy them all?
Sorcery hasn't been needed until the full moon, but it's now needed instead of your cold steel, Kara.
Her father was a great sorcerer callously taken by gods let alone by human yet this one day.
But how is that possible against their power?
Because there exists a breed of creatures who fears nothing.
So they can accomplish anything.
You describe a distinct human trait. we cannot chance these five meeting up with one called father.
They would alert him.
Aye.
So what do you suggest?
I think an early strike as they arrive in Nobu Village should do it.
I would need two of those like myself, day walkers.
And the father should be found.
See who wants their blood.
After I manage this task. what do you wish, to be made queen?
No,
I want my soul back.
After all the power you have felt in your veins?
I want to be who I am, what I am, not one of you.
Should I fear you, Kara?
You know what lies within me and I am what you need me to be.
Should I fear you?
You already do. we will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.
I don't expect much resistance except by the princess.
All in all, they are a pathetic group.
He comes here every evening to sell his catch.
Catch?
He's a fisherman now.
Now, now, ladies, you'll have to accept my apology.
I must leave.
There's an adventure in the offing.
Now, mark my words, if I didn't have to go off and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,
I would surely have you all to bed... again.
Can I see that spear right there, please?
Never mind.
There, why the long face, huh?
It is for the grand adventure that we live.
And it's not just the adventure itself.
It's the willingness to risk everything for it.
Something chased you off the street. what is your trouble, girl?
Something very terrible.
And what was that?
A vampire.
I know it's dead, but still I saw the things.
You see, I beleve you, girl.
This day there are vampires in Nobu.
So, I'm off. my, could you send an old rogue off with a proper farew
I believe we have an adventurer here.
I can taste it.
May the gods smile on your adventure, child.
The next time a warning would be nice. where can I find her?
Come now.
Levana,
- Kara?
- Your Highness.
You know what do with them.
This is your life now?
I have no life just the sins.
Bleak and bleaker.
That princess and they that hold it are under the sword.
Mind your own business, sir.
Nobu has always been a refuge where marriages are by and large human.
Now changes come to Nobu.
The world evolves.
Aye, mostly for the bad.
Do we have a quarrel, sir?
Have we met?
In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,
I knew your kind. well, maybe I am sick but I was pleasured by the killing.
They deserved to die.
I loved hearing their suffering, seeing their terror, and the begging and screaming.
There was real pleasure in that.
Sometimes life does not unfold as it should, and I do not have to explain myself to you.
I ask again, do we have a quarrel, sir?
I am presently engaged.
Did I do your mother, huh?
So, where is this renowned father? will our father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer who fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps we cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
I know you'll have my head for that, but not if I have yours first. what is this?
I would appreciate that back.
Come and take it.
I ask you once if we had a quarrel.
I knew the princess.
Now we have a quarrel.
Joy that's not marred by love. we have much to celebrate now that the full moon is seen.
You, me, the great love affair we shared.
The love by which you destroyed my father, and had me with your stick to dust.
But I harbor no grudge. well, perhaps just a bit of heartbreak and spite.
And bring that ridiculous rebate of a weapon of yours. what does that make him?
Is he an active vampire or is he a quarter vampire? I mean, what... what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?
You know, next time a warning would be nice.
